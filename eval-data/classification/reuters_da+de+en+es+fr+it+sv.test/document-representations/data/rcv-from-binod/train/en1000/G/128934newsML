SUPPORT FOR FINNISH SDP STEADY IN EUROPOLL . Support for Finland ' s leading Social Democrats was broadly unchanged from general elections in 1995 but the opposition centre party gained ground , according to advance results in municipal and European Parliament elections on Sunday , the Finnish STT news agency said . The preliminary result from Finland ' s first poll for the Strasbourg - based parliament , announced as polls closed , was based on a count of advance votes cast by about one - fifth of the 4 . 1 million eligible voters in the run - up to polling day . Advance results from the European parliament elections pointed to a 26 . 0 percent showing for the Centre Party , up from 19 . 8 in 1995 , with the Social Democrats at 22 . 1 percent , down from 28 . 3 . But in municipal elections , the SDP led with 25 . 3 percent ahead of the Centre Party at 22 . 6 percent . Full unofficial results from the municipal vote are due around 1930 GMT , and from the European poll at 2000 . Finland joined the European Union with Austria and Sweden in January 1995 after a referendum in which membership won 57 percent support , but this is the first direct poll for Euro MPs . Voters elected 16 representatives to the Strasbourg - based parliament from 207 candidates in nationwide balloting .

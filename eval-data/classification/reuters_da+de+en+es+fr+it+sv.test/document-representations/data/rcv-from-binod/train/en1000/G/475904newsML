India , Pakistan work to make headway despite odds . India and Pakistan are working hard to find a face - saving way around their intractable dispute over Kashmir , both sides keen to emerge as peacemakers rather than quarrelsome neighbours . The two nations , regarded as threshold nuclear powers , have fought three wars since 1947 , two of them over Kashmir . Diplomats said the foreign secretaries of the two countries , meeting in New Delhi since Friday were locked in a difficult balancing act to placate hardliners at home and mounting international pressure to normalise their tense relations . " Doves have never clinched a peace deal in the world . They only prepare the ground , " said a defence analyst at an embassy in New Delhi . " Whatever happens here must be endorsed by the hawks in both countries . That may not be quite as impossible as it looks . " He was referring to recent public opinion polls in both countries showing increasing support for peace . The current talks , reviving a dialogue stalled since January 1994 , have pitted Indian foreign secretary Salman Haidar against his Pakistani opposite number Shamshad Ahmad . " Both are carrying a difficult brief not to make any major concessions on Kashmir , " said Bharat Karnad , an analyst at Delhi ' s Centre for Policy Research . " And both will be eager to make progress , despite their given handicap . " From India ' s perspective , there appeared to be room for manoeuvre outside the official brief . An opinion poll in Delhi ' s Outlook magazine on Sunday showed 72 percent of Indians were prepared to make " minor adjustments " on Kashmir , two - thirds held by India , the rest by Pakistan . Pakistani officials insist on " some progress " on Kashmir as a condition for moving forward on other issues , such as demarcation of their maritime border and disengagement of troops from the Siachen glacier , the world ' s highest battlefield . India says the state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of its territory and its status is not negotiable . " I fervently pray that they don ' t break off the talks , " said Jyotindra Nath Dixit , who led the Indian side at the last foreign secretaries ' talks in Islamabad in January 1994 . " Both sides must realise they can ' t be held hostage by some three million people in the Kashmir Valley . " Dixit said his talks with then Pakistani foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan broke off abruptly when then Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto decided to raise the issue of Kashmir . " My relations with Shaharyar were excellent , but officials are often hostage to the whims of their governments , " he said . Diplomats said Indian Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were more receptive to a thaw in bilateral ties than their predecessors . Indian Foreign Minister Inder Gujral , regarded as the main architect of the resumed dialogue with Pakistan , has proposed China - type talks between the two countries , a reference to efforts to end the Indian - China border dispute that led to a brief war in 1962 . The two countries signed an agreement to promote peace and tranquillity on their borders in 1993 , allowing them to improve bilateral ties in other key areas . Officials close to the India - Pakistan talks said the two sides were expected to discuss the model . " We ' ll wait and see if they find the China - India model acceptable , " said one official who asked not to be named . " They could also explore the possibility of joint working groups to focus closely on the more contentious issues . " Diplomats said the United States and other Western countries were pressing India and Pakistan to ease their stand - off , mainly because of worries over their nuclear capabilities . " India does not publicly accept mediation , but the United States particularly is in a situation to gently guide Pakistan to help improve its ties with India , " one diplomat said . " That ' s why it is crucial for both to keep a low public profile on the nuts and bolts of the dialogue .

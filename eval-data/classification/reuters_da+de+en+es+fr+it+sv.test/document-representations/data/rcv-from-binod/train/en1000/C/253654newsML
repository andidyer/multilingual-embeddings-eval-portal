RTRS - AUSTRALIA TRANSPORT - National Rail on acquisition track . National Rail Corp ( NRC ) says it would be interested in buying parts of South Australian based passenger rail operator Australian National ( AN ) if the sale conditions were right . " We have certainly expressed to the Commonwealth government an interest in looking at the commercial prospects of some aspects of Australian National , " NRC chief Vince Graham told Reuters in an interview . Last month the Federal government signalled its intention to sell its 100 percent stake in AN and its 40 percent stake in NRC , which operates interstate freight services . Graham said as a commercial company , NRC was interested in any commercial opportunities that could be part of the Australian National sale . However , Graham said NRC would not be interested in AN ' s operations unless they were split up so that any buyer was not lumbered with the unprofitable passenger operations . " The passenger businesses are not commercial businesses in the sense that I don ' t think there is any expectation that those passenger businesses with make a profit , " Graham said . Graham said NRC was looking for commercial opportunities that did not require taxpayers ' support . In terms of the programme for the sale of National Rail , Graham said that it depended on the Federal government ' s discussions with NRC ' s other shareholders , the state governments of New South Wales and Victoria . " There is no firm timetable for that as yet , " he said . Graham said NRC had already had expressions of interests in the NRC from Toll Holdings Ltd , TNT Ltd , Queensland Rail , and a consortium led by Macquarie Bank Ltd . " There probably will be some offshore interest , but until there is some expression of interest document or request put out to the market you really don ' t know who is going to want to bid , " he said . Graham said in the past three years since NRC ' s formation , the business had gone from being bankrupt to a point where the private sector was keenly interested in buying it . " People would have had a quiet chuckle three years ago if you would have suggested a sale , " he said . " When they formed National Rail , the interstate freight business in the hands of five states , was losing A $ 320 million a year , of which about A $ 220 million was cash . " " It was haemorrhaging cash , " he said . Graham said the task National Rail had been given was affecting a turnaround of the business and the substantial focus of this task had been on quality improvement and cost reduction . " On neither count are we finished , " Graham said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

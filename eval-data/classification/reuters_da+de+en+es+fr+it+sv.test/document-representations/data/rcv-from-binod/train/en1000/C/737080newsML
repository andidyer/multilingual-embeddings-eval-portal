RESEARCH ALERT - Salomon ups Smith & Nephew . Salomon Brothers said on Thursday that its analysts Jeremy Green and Kevin Wilson had raised their rating on British healthcare group Smith & Nephew Plc to a buy from a hold . The analysts said the current share price failed to reflect the opportunity offered by the company ' s new tissue replacement product Dermagraft . " In our view investors need to value Smith & Nephew ' s core business and the Dermagraft franchise separately , " the analysts said . " While 1997 is set to be a difficult year , the current share price more than adequately discounts this . " The analysts said after valuing the Dermagraft product and the group ' s core business separately , they established a 12 - month share price target for the group of 200 pence per share . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

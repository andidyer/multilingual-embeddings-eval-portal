BHP says Delta not repaying Hartley funds . The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd said on Tuesday Delta Gold NL has said at this stage it does not intend to repay BHP its 33 percent share of project funding for the Hartley platinum mine in Zimbabe . " Under the joint venture agreement with Delta , whilst this situation applies , BHP has the right to take and sell 70 percent of Delta ' s share of product following completion of development , thus leaving Delta with 9 . 9 percent product ownership , " it said . As part of the Hartley Platinum joint venture agreement with BHP , in 1993 Delta elected to have BHP fund 100 percent of the project . Hartley is projected to yield annually 150 , 000 ounces of platinum , 110 , 000 ounces of palladium , 11 , 500 ounces of rhodium and 23 , 000 ounces of gold . BHP said the current capital cost of the project had risen to US $ 289 million from US $ 287 million during the last quarterly period . The cost figure does not take into account a further US $ 80 million in net operating costs prior to the project ' s completion , BHP said . Development of the mine and related facilities was originally scheduled for completion at the end of 1997 but due to delays , completion may take up to a further 12 months , BHP said . - - Sydney newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

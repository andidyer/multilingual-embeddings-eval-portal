San Diego area the site of previous tragedies . The San Diego area , where 39 cult members committed suicide in the belief they would be transported to heaven by a UFO hiding behind a comet , has been the site of several notorious tragedies . Rancho Santa Fe , the exclusive San Diego enclave where this week ' s deaths occurred , was rocked 4 - 1 / 2 years ago by a murder - suicide that made headlines around the world . Ian Spiro , a British businessman who reportedly worked for the CIA and the British secret service , shot his wife and three young children in November 1992 in their rented million - dollar home . Spiro , apparently despondent over money woes , killed himself three days later with a lethal dose of cyanide . The family was subsequently found to be $ 5 million in debt . One of the worst air crashes in U . S . history occurred in San Diego in 1978 when a commercial jet approaching San Diego airport was struck in mid - air by a small Cessna , killing all 144 people on board the two aircraft and seven on the ground . In 1979 , a 16 - year - old girl shot and killed an elementary school principal , a janitor and eight children in the San Diego suburb of San Carlos with a rifle she had received as a Christmas present . She is serving 25 years to life in prison . In one of the most shocking shooting sprees in U . S . history , James Huberty , 41 , strolled into a crowded McDonald ' s restaurant in San Ysidro on July 18 , 1984 , and opened fire , killing 20 people . He was later shot to death by police . In 1985 , a man killed his wife and four family members in the suburb of El Cajon . One year later , three men and a woman were killed in suburban College Grove , and in 1989 postal worker John Taylor shot and killed his wife and two co - workers . He killed himself a day later . In 1993 , a 19 - year - old college student opened fire in a family fitness centre in El Cajon , killing four people before turning the gun on himself . And two years ago , an apparently deranged man killed five members of his family with a hammer , a knife and an axe in the suburb of Vista before setting fire to the house in a bid to cover up the murders . He subsequently confessed to the killings .

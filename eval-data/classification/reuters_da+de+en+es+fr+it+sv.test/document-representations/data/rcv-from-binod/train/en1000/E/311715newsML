Brazil won ' t shake budget woes in ' 97 - economists . Brazil ' s attempts to rein in government spending fell dramatically short of expectations last year and efforts should prove equally hard for federal belt - tighteners in 1997 , economists said . Brasilia is up against a public sector hungry for wage hikes , lawmakers eyeing an estimated $ 10 billion in privatization revenue and a reform agenda whose success seems increasingly dependent on back - room political dealing . " The bottom line is the fiscal situation is not going to improve that much this year , " said Guilherme Abbud , an economist for ING Barings in Brazil . The National Treasury on Wednesday said its 1996 cash - concept deficit was 9 . 05 billion reais , up from from 4 . 08 billion the year before . The Central Bank is expected to release its more closely watched public sector operational result - encompassing local , state and federal balance sheets - over the next two weeks . At the beginning of 1996 , the federal government pledged to cut the public sector operational deficit - which also includes interest payments at the three levels of government - from 5 . 0 percent of GDP in 1995 to 2 . 5 percent in 1996 . But they are now bracing for a 1996 shortfall much closer to 4 . 5 pecent of GDP . Economists note that nearly all of last year ' s slight improvement came from a sharp drop in real interest rates to an annual 15 percent from 30 percent . But such a steep decline , which cut real debt servicing costs , is not in store for 1997 , putting more pressure at all levels of government to tighten purse strings . Slashing spending is essential to secure Brazil ' s economic recovery program and keep it in good stead with global investors , economists say . Foot - dragging on the fiscal front is the main reason Standard & Poor ' s Corp and Moody ' s Investor Service Inc have failed to upgrade Brazil ' s B - plus and B1 credit ratings , respectively . Most economists agree Brasilia can not repair its fiscal image until the constitution is amended to allow government to fire workers and do away with costly retirement packages . " This is a constitutionally mandated deficit and there is little room for imporvement until the constitution is changed , " said Marcelo Carvalho , JP Morgan ' s chief economist in Brazil . But even the modest gains in deficit reduction hoped for this year could be held up by several factors , economists said . First , federal officials are obligated to grant wage hikes to public sector workers , whose pay was not adjusted in 1996 . Economists say a salary adjustment of eight percent to 10 percent , as the government has suggested , is acceptable . But a pending court case could rule in favor of a small group of workers who are demanding a 28 percent hike based on legal grounds . If a court agrees , the ruling could set a precedent and pressure Brasilia to offer a bigger hike to all workers , economists said . Economists note that anticipated privatization revenue will improve federal accounts if it is used to reduce Brazil ' s mammoth $ 218 billion domestic debt stock and thereby cut interest costs . But a number of Congressmen have argued that part of the money raised from the sale of federal assets should be distributed to poor states . Economists fear that it could become increasingly difficult for the government to claim all the money while still trying to push through its ambitious politcal and economic reform package . " A lot of people in Congress still want that money , " ING ' s Abbud said . ( ( - - Sao Paulo newsroom , 5511 248 - 5414 ) )

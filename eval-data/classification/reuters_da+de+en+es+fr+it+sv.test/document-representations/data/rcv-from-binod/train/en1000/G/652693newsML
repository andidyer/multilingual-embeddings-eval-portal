Commission calls Croatian campaign O . K . Croatia ' s central electoral commission rejected complaints on Wednesday about the campaign for Sunday ' s presidential elections and said it had no power to delay the vote because of an assault on one of President Franjo Tudjman ' s opponents . Commission head Ivan Mrkonjic told reporters that about a dozen complaints had been received but all were declared unfounded and the rulings endorsed by the Constitutional Court . " A logical conclusion is that the election campaign is regular , " Mrkonjic said . Tudjman , 75 , is widely expected to win an easy first round re - election . The call for a two week delay came from Vlado Gotovac , 66 , who is the joint candidate of nine opposition parties and says he lost campaigning time when an army officer struck him on the head with a belt buckle at a rally , causing concussion and neck injuries which confined him to bed . Mrkonjic said the commission would not even discuss the request . " The commission does not set the election day , so it can not change it , " he said .

Carrefour unit sells 15 stores to Lidl . Carrefour said on Monday that its Erteco hard - discount retailer had sold 15 stores in southwestern France to Germany ' s Lidl . It did not disclose the terms of the sale . " Erteco , a unit of Carrefour , said the decision reflected the consequences of a new retail law which precludes its attaining a sufficient number of stores to establish a profitable retail distribution centre in the southwestern region in a reasonable period of time , " Carrefour said in a statement . The French law passed last year aims to protect city centres and small shops by making it harder for superstores to expand or open new outlets . Erteco , which operates the Ed l ' Epicier and Europa Discount hard - discount stores , has 385 other stores , all in France , a spokeswoman for Carrefour said . Its business in the other four regions in France in which it operates has exceeded the minimum critical mass , and it expects to expand those activities with the opening of 11 stores in 1996 , the spokeswoman said . She said Erteco would have needed at least 30 more stores to make its southwestern operation work . Erteco generated sales of 5 . 9 billion francs last year , excluding sales tax . Carrefour ' s 1995 sales totalled 164 . 32 billion francs . - - Paris Newsroom , + 33 1 4221 5452

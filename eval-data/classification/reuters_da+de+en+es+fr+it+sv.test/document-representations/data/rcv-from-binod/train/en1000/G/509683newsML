N . Korea ' s Kim in power play on father ' s birthday . Hunger - stricken North Korea marked the anniversary of the birth of its late " Great Leader " Kim Il - sung on Tuesday as his son and de facto leader Kim Jong - il shored up his position by appointing more than 100 new generals . North Korean media , while lavishing praise on Kim Il - sung , the founder of the Stalinist state who died in July 1994 at age 82 , described his 55 - year - old son as " the great successor " . " The respected comrade Kim Jong - il is the great successor and distinguished leader who has led the Workers ' Party of Korea and the revolution to a brilliant victory , " the state - run Korean Central News Agency said on Tuesday . Kim Jong - il , supreme commander of the North ' s 1 . 1 - million strong military , has yet to be formally confirmed in two key posts held by his late father - - general secretary of the ruling Workers ' Party and state president . North Korea watchers believe Kim junior will formally assume the posts after the third anniversary of his father ' s death in July . In a fresh sign that he was on course towards communism ' s first dynastic succession , Kim Jong - il this week ordered the promotion of more than 120 army officers to generals . Korea watchers said this was the largest round of promotions in North Korea since the death of Kim Il - sung and it suggested that Kim junior was trying to consolidate his power base . " It is yet another sign that Kim Jong - il is consolidating his grip on power , " said Park Sung - hoon , director - general at South Korea ' s National Unification Ministry . In a meeting with Japan ' s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Tuesday , visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong - ha said Kim was " attaching importance to the military " . Many analysts , including Shinya Kato of Radiopress , said there were no rivals in the reclusive communist state to take on Kim Jong - il , who had been groomed to succeed his father for more than two decades . " In the quest for the key posts , Kim Jong - il has no rivals , " he said . Radiopress is a Tokyo - based news agency that monitors the North Korean media . Japan ' s Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said on Monday that there were some internal struggles in North Korea ' s leadership but they were not serious enough to threaten Kim Jong - il . Analysts said Kim junior ' s future grip on power , however , would hinge on whether he could resolve the food crisis brought on by two successive years of devastating floods . " If and when the food crisis can be resolved are the keys to the future of Kim Jong - il , " said Kato of Radiopress . Fears of imminent catastrophe were heightened after reports last week that North Korea ' s secretive government had told aid agencies that 134 children had died of malnutrition . The U . N . World Food Programme has appealed for $ 95 . 5 million for 200 , 000 tonnes of food for North Korea , well short of what it has said is needed to stave off famine . Top U . S . defence officials last week cautioned against rushing to help North Korea , saying the nation was on a war footing despite its appeals for food to avert famine . U . S . Defence Secretary William Cohen , during a visit to South Korea , portrayed a repressive North Korean government cynically begging for food while pouring scarce resources into a military ready to strike its southern neighbour .

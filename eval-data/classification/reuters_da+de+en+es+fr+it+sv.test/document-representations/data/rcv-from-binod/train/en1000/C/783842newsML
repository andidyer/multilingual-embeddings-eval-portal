Strong Q4 seen for international air cargo . Two senior U . S . air cargo industry officials are sending out signals that the fourth quarter international air cargo peak could be the strongest in years . Peter Rose , chief executive of Seattle - based freight forwarder Expeditors Inc , told Reuters by telephone : " We ' re in the throes of the peak season ( already ) and there ' s every hint that this could be a good one . " There hasn ' t been one for a number of years . We ' re getting a lot of signs ( of strong demand ) from the space that ' s available on the airlines - the airlines are all raising their rates 10 - 20 percent , 10 percent throughout the Far East , 20 percent in Hong Kong . " On the Pacific in particular , airlines are looking at further increases " and it ' s going to be one of those whatever - the - market - will - bear things , " Rose said . The transpacific peak is already showing signs of developing for the current calender quarter , he said . Freight forwarders are looking at chartering and split chartering and checking with the airlines about possible extra flights . Mark Najarian , vice - president cargo sales for American Airlines , said he has already started alerting customers about a busy peak . " It ' s come to the point where we ' re telling customers that if you don ' t make allocations with us now , you ' re not going to get allocations from us in the fourth quarter because we just don ' t have any space , " he told Reuters from Fort Worth , Texas . That also applies to customers not using their allocations today , he said . " Every market should be pretty busy in the fourth quarter .

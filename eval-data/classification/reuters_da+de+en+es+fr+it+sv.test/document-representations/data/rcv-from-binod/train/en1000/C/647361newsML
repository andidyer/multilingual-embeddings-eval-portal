India Left to press plan to prevent oil price hike . India ' s main communist party on Monday said it would press its partners in the ruling coalition to accept a plan that would avoid a painful increase in prices of oil products . But the Communist Party of India - Marxist or CPI ( M ) stopped short of threatening to pull out of the coalition if the price rise - - which economists say is overdue - - is pushed through . " We are pressurising them and getting them to accept our view , " CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told reporters . The CPM ' s plan calls for the government to return to the state - run oil sector surplus funds taken from it by earlier governments , and the elimination of customs and excise duties . The CPI ( M ) is the largest of four left - wing parties in the ruling coalition . It does not hold any cabinet posts but provides grudging support to the government in parliament . The policy - making Steering Committee of Prime Minister Inder KUmar Gujral ' s 15 - party United Front coalition is scheduled to meet next Sunday to discuss the price increase after two earlier meetings ended without agreement among the partners . Asked if the CPM would withdraw support to the alliance if its plan was rejected , Yechury said : " We hope such a situation does not arise , we hope the situation does not reach such a pass . " He said the party would take the issue to the people and launch an agitation from mid - July if oil product prices were raised . The left parties would stand together on the issue , he said . " The government is in fact squeezing the oil sector of its surplus to meet the overall fiscal deficit while the people are being continuously burdened with price hikes , " said Yechury . Analysts say the long - delayed oil price hike is necessary if the federal government is to bridge the oil pool deficit - - the money the government owes oil companies for selling petroleum products well below international rates . The oil pool deficit was estimated at 155 billion rupees ( $ 4 . 33 billion ) at the end of March , the government said . Yechury said there was no dispute on the need to bridge the deficit urgently , but the dispute was on how to do it . He said the Finance Ministry had argued that the only way to bridge the deficit was by an across - the - board hike in prices of all products except petrol . Yechury said the CPI ( M ) objected to this manner of bridging the deficit since a hike would hurt the working class and result in a cascading impact on prices of other commodities . The party said the oil pool account was in surplus for a long time but had begun to accumulate deficits over the past few years . " The 89 - billion - rupee surplus in the account was looted by the Finance Ministry from 1989 onwards , " the party said . Yechury said funds had been siphoned off from the oil pool account to balance the books and the oil sector had been " milched " to meet the fiscal deficit . " The story of the oil pool deficit is one of the Finance Ministry covering up its fiscal profligacy at the expense of the oil sector and the people , " the plan said . Yechury said if the outstanding money was returned at the government ' s inter - departmental interest rates , it would amount to 278 . 5 billion rupees as of March 31 , 1997 . The plan also calls for the removal of customs and excise duties levied on the oil sector , and estimated in the 1997 / 98 national budget to amount to more than 196 billion rupees . ( $ 1 = 35 . 75 rupees )

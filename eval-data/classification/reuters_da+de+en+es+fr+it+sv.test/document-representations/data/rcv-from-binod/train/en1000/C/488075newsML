Proxima sees Q4 loss . Proxima Corp said Friday it expects an operating loss of up to $ 0 . 20 a share for the quarter ended March 31 , and a loss in excess of $ 1 . 05 per share after special charges . Analysts are forecasting earnings of $ 0 . 06 a share , according to First Call . Proxima reported earnings of $ 0 . 47 a share in the year - earlier fiscal fourth quarter . The company said the expected net loss includes an inventory charge of $ 5 million net of tax benefits , and one - time charges of $ 1 . 8 million net of tax benefits from a restructuring , severance benefits and a write - down of assets . Excluding the special charges , totalling about $ 0 . 93 a share , the company said it expects a loss from operations of up to $ 0 . 20 a share . Commenting on the inventory charge , Dennis Whittler , vice president and chief financial officer , said the market ' s transition to higher - resolution SVGA projectors occurred faster than expected . Both market prices and the volume of VGA resolution products declined rapidly in the quarter , the company said . Proxima said its VGA product sales fell from over $ 21 million in the third quarter to about $ 10 million in the fourth quarter , while gross margins for VGA products declined significantly . Certain VGA models were sold below cost in the fourth quarter , it said . Based on expectations of continuing erosion in average selling prices of VGA products , Proxima said it will record an inventory charge of about $ 5 million to recognize the lower market value of these products . It said it is taking a restructuring charge of nearly $ 1 million to recognize the cost of reorganizing operations as it moves toward a flatter , more nimble organizational structure . Proxima said it had reduced its workforce nearly 20 percent in the fourth quarter , resulting in severance costs of about $ 400 , 000 . The company said it will record an asset write - down of $ 430 , 000 , primarily for tooling that supported the manufacture of VGA projectors . Proxima said it expects to report fourth quarter results in early May .

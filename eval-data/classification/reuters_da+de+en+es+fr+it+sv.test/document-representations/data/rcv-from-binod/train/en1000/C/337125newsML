Gulf Canada calls Clyde defence unrealistic . Gulf Canada Resources Ltd on Tuesday dismissed the latest defence of bid target Clyde Petroleum Plc , saying the British firm ' s net assets were valued on unrealistic assumptions . " The valuation put forward by Clyde ' s board is not credible . It is based on questionable technical , commercial and economic assumptions , " said Gulf Canada ' s president and chief executive officer J . P . Bryan . Gulf Canada said the net asset values in Clyde ' s defence document were based on unrealistic assumptions as to oil price , discount rate and exchange rate . It also criticised the valuations for not including corporate overheads . The Canadian firm said " leading " petroleum consultants Scientific Software - Intercomp ( SSI ) found that the estimates understated the technical risks of future projects . Gulf Canada quoted SSI as saying : " The valuation of Clyde contains an overly optimistic assumption of its forecast production growth . " Clyde expects average daily production to rise nine percent in 1997 to 44 , 900 barrels of oil equivalent ( boepd ) and increase further to an average 55 , 200 boepd in 1998 and 60 , 200 in 1999 . The British company said that Energy Resource Consultants ( ERC ) valued its net assets between 120 pence - - based on an oil price of $ 18 per barrel - - and 144 pence - - based on an oil price of $ 21 per barrel . Gulf Canada commented that hostile bids in the oil exploration and production sector were usually concluded at an average of about 75 percent of the consultant ' s valuation . " Gulf ' s offer is 87 . 5 percent of of ERC ' s inflated value , which is substantially higher than this average , " Gulf Canada said . The company said leading analysts on average valued Clyde ' s net assets at 78 pence per share , but declined to give an estimate itself . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

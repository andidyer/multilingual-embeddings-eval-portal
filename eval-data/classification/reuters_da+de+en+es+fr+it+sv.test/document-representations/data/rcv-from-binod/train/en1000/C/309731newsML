Arab Bank profits up 18 percent in 1996 . Arab Bank , one of the region ' s major financial institutions , reported on Wednesday a 18 percent rise in 1996 net profits to a record 95 . 7 million dinars ( $ 135 . 2 million ) . " This is our best result since our founding and is due to better results in our branches in Europe , the U . S . , the Far East and the Gulf states , " Abdul - Majeed Shoman , chairman of Arab Bank plc , told Reuters . The bank ' s total balance sheet rose by 4 . 3 percent to 13 . 481 billion dinars at end of December 1996 against 12 . 927 billion dinars in December 1995 . The results exclude subsidiaries and large holdings in Arab banks which are under the Arab Bank Group umbrella , with a total balance sheet of above $ 22 . 9 billion in 1995 . Customer deposits rose by 10 percent to 6 . 396 billion dinars at end of 1996 from 5 . 797 billion dinars a year before . Loans rose 12 percent to 4 . 163 billion dinars against 3 . 711 billion dinars in 1995 . Total shareholders equity rose to 630 million dinars from 552 million dinars at end of 1995 , the bank ' s balance sheet showed . Long - term investments rose 58 percent to 727 . 6 million in 1996 from 450 million in 1995 . Shoman said Arab Bank , with over 300 branches globally , had expanded its international presence with two new representative offices in Shanghai , China and in Santiago , Chile . The bank ' s shares , which account for over a third of the Amman Financial Market ' s capitalisation , have risen since the government unveiled late last year a package of reforms that include cancelling a 15 percent tax levied on companies ' capital increases . Shoman said the bank would keep a pledge to shareholders to distribute a bonus share once the tax is cancelled under new companies law due to be passed by parliament by April . The bank , established in 1930 , and the oldest Palestinian bank , also extended further its operations in Palestinian self - rule areas to a total of 16 branches in the West Bank and Gaza . The bank joined in a 55 percent equity shareholding last year in the $ 15 million capitalised Arab Palestine Investment Bank which is due to begin operations soon . Arab Bank has captured nearly 60 percent of the market share of a total $ 1 . 7 billion of bank deposits in the West Bank and Gaza since it began operations there two years ago . Arab Bank was a latecomer to a banking boom that began after Middle East peace accords in 1993 allowed Jordanian banks to resume operations after a 26 - year absence which followed Israel ' s seizure of the West Bank .

FORECAST - Bufete 1996 loss seen narrowing . Mexican construction company Bufete Industrial SA is expected to post a much more narrow loss for 1996 as the company begins to leave the dark days of 1995 ' s recession behind , analyst said . Five analysts surveyed forecast an average net loss of 1 . 45 pesos per CPO share for 1996 , down from a net per - share loss of 8 . 97 pesos in 1995 . Analysts said , however , that net losses for the year were less important than a rebound in revenues and operating earnings , lower financial costs and a bulkier backlog of projects . " Bufete had a strong fourth quarter , but it won ' t be as meteoric as the third quarter of ' 96 . I believe revenues and operating income for the fourth quarter could be lower than those of the third quarter , " said Ben Uglow , an analyst with Flemings Research in New York . Bufete may post sales of 4 . 364 billion pesos for 1996 , 46 percent more than in 1995 , Gerardo Saenz , an analyst with OBSA - GSerfin brokerage , said . He said operating earnings could be 184 million pesos , or 148 percent more than in 1995 , and net losses be cut from 589 million to just 68 million pesos . For some analysts , one of the brighter aspects of Bufete ' s 1996 performance was to replace costly peso - denominated debt with dollar - denominated debt contracted at more favorable rates . There were some lingering concerns , however . " We need to look at the balance sheet . There are still some concerns regarding working capital and accounts receivable , " said Christopher Hussey , an analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York . Bufete has a substantial amount of accounts receivable from the Federal Electricity Commission , which have drained its cash flow and raised financial costs .

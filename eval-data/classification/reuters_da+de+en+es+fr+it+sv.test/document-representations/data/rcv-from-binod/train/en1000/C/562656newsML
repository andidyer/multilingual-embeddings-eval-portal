CVRD price seen somewhat disappointing - analysts . The final 32 . 00 reais a share price for which Brazil mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce was sold on Tuesday was on the low end of market expectations and something of a disappointment . Speaking immediately after the auction results were announced , several analysts surveyed by Reuters said the final CVRD price was not as high as they had hoped or expected . " This is something of a surprise and I think it ' s bad , " said Marcelo Mesquita an equity analyst at Banco de Investimentos Garantia . A consortium led by Brazil ' s CSN steel group acquired a controlling 41 . 7 percent stake of CVRD for 3 . 3 billion reais ( $ 3 . 1 billion ) , or just under 20 percent over the 26 . 67 reais per share base price . CVRD , until now the pride of Brazil ' s state sector , is a huge mining , paper and pulp conglomerate , which among other holdings controls the world ' s single largest iron ore reserves . Like many of his colleagues , Mesquita expressed surprise the Valecom group , the only other consortium bidding for CVRD , had not been willing to stretch further during the auction . " We thought ( they ) would be willing to pay more for CVRD . The message is that the conservative investors who did their due diligence , know their stuff and had the cash , felt the bid would not be good beyond these levels , " said Mesquita . The Valecom group , until today widely considered the favorite to carry the CVRD auction , was led by Brazil ' s paper , pulp and cement conglomerate Votorantim and South African mining group Anglo - American . Sidney Chameh , chief analyst at Banco Fator , said the final price was on the low end of the 20 to 25 percent range the market had anticipated . " I think the price was about right . I don ' t see any room for the upside in the short term , " he said . Reginaldo Alexandre , an equity analyst at Unibanco , said the 32 . 00 reais per share price paid by CSN put the total of CVRD voting stock at 12 . 435 billion reais ( $ 11 . 5 billion ) " A year ago we forecast the company ' s full value should be estimated at between $ 10 to $ 13 million and today ' s price was within that range , " he said . Analysts said the CSN - led consortia included more partners that the Votorantim group and said that , down the line this meant there would probably be several different interests to cater to . " The fact the Valepar group won means we might see a little more action once they take over the management , " said Sidney Chameh . " This is because there are more partners involved and each one will be pulling their own way . " Analysts said the would not be surprised if once they moved into the CVRD boardroom , the Valepar group quickly announced a series of mergers , divestures or even the inclusion of new partners into the group .

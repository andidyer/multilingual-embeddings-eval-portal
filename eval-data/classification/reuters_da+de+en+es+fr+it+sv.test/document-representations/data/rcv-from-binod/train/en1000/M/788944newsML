IRAQ WANTS UP TO 100 , 000 TONNES FRENCH WHEAT . Iraq , about to resume crude sales in an oil - for - food deal with the United Nations , tendered on Friday to buy up to 100 , 000 tonnes of French wheat , grain traders said . The wheat is for shipment in September or October . Traders said the wheat was to be shipped between September 15 and October 31 . Offers are due on August 15 with an answer due by August 20 . Traders said French wheat at $ 152 per tonne or so for September is uncompetitive for the time being , after the European Union raised an export tax to six Ecus per tonne on Thursday to discourage excessive sales . Iraq earlier this week bought 50 , 000 tonnes of wheat from the United States and traders said that purchase may have been extended by a further 25 , 000 tonnes . Baghdad plans to resume oil exports in mid - August after reaching agreement with the United Nations on a new aid distribution plan as part of an oil - for - food deal . It is allowed to import grain with cash raised from U . N . - monitored oil sales to relieve the effects of sanctions imposed after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait .

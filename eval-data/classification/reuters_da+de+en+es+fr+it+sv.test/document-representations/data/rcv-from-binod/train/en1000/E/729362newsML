NYC likely to postpone summer note sales to autumn . Flush with cash , New York City likely will postpone until autumn its usual summer note sales , which last year totaled approximately $ 2 . 4 billion from July to September , financial sources said on Tuesday . While cautioning the city was not yet prepared to make an announcement , one financial source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said : " I think it ' s much more likely that ( the city ) will have one or two more note sales in the fall . " Another financial source , who also did not wish to be named , explained that New York City would be able to put off its borrowing because its tax collections were so large . He noted the city ended its 1997 fiscal year on June 30 with about $ 2 billion , after writing a check for $ 1 . 3 billion to pay debt service . How long it has been since the city has been able to delay a summer note sale was not immediately available . The notes would have to mature by the start of its next fiscal year under regulations designed to prevent it from repeating its mid - 1970s financial crisis . New York City had told state Comptroller H . Carl McCall who coordinates debt sales by the state , agencies and localties , that it had expected to sell notes this summer , as has been its typical pattern .

OPTIONS - U . S . debt vols steady as futures sit . Implied volatilities for U . S . debt options finished the session slightly lower Wednesday , suggesting the market anticipates more range trading ahead , options brokers said . July Treasury bond volatility ended near 8 . 7 percent , down from 9 . 0 percent on the opening and slightly below the previous day ' s close . September was unchanged at 8 . 5 percent after sticking close to that level all day . Some traders expressed surprise that bond volatility rates were not budging farther before Friday ' s May U . S . employment report , although the old pattern of values rising before the data has faltered in recent months . " Going into what is historically a very volatile number , I would think we should be much higher in terms of volatility , " said a floor broker for a U . S . house . " That says people think we will continue to trade in this range . " Volatility crept up last week , then stalled as the underlying futures encountered stubborn resistance above 110 - 00 . September bond futures settled at 110 - 01 , down 2 / 32 , after earlier edging up to a three - week high of 110 - 05 . The contract has been unsuccessful in several attempts this week to extend gains beyond a band of resistance stretching to 110 - 12 , and the waning momentum has capped volatility , traders and analysts said . Below the market , good support is seen at the 200 - day moving average at 109 - 23 , the bond floor broker said . He predicted volatility would attract a short - term bid if September futures finally vaulted the upside roadblocks and a much stronger bid on a downside breakout . Traders said the day ' s highlight in bond options was a New York dealer firm ' s purchase of 4 , 000 September 109 - 00 puts . In Eurodollars , the biggest transaction involved one firm ' s straddle buying to cover a previously established short volatility position . The firm bought a total of 12 , 000 September 94 . 00 straddles over the past two sessions , helping volatility for the month gain 0 . 1 point to 9 . 0 percent , brokers said . December volatility also climbed slightly , to 10 . 9 percent . - - Susan Kelly , Chicago Derivatives Desk ( ( 312 - 408 - 8750 ) ) E - mail : derivatives @ reuters . com

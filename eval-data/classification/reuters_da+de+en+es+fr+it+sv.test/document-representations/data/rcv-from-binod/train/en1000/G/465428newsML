SOCCER - ALBANIA NAMES FOREIGN - BASED PLAYERS FOR WORLD CUP TIES . Albania , battered by weeks of armed anarchy , on Tuesday named a 20 - man squad drawn exclusively from Albanians playing for foreign clubs for their forthcoming World Cup ties against Ukraine and Germany . Albanian media said the squad were due to gather in Madrid on March 26 for their group nine qualifier with Ukraine three days later . Most play for Greek and German teams , others are in Slovenia , Croatia , Romania and Malta . The match , along with another qualifier against Germany on April 2 , was switched from Tirana to the neutral venue of Grenada , Spain , because of the turmoil sweeping Albania . The trouble erupted earlier this year after rebels angry about the failure of savings schemes seized control of the south and demanded President Sali Berisha quit . The unrest spread throughout the country . The Albanian team have not played since December 14 , when they lost 0 - 2 to Ireland in Dublin . Before that they have drawn 1 - 1 with Armenia in Tirana and lost 0 - 3 to Portugal . Squad : Fotaq Strakosha , Rudi Vata , Arjan Xhumba , Ardian Bushi , Bledar Kola , Altin Haxhi , Altin Reklli , Fatmir Vata , Igli Tare , Salvador Kacaj , Kliton Bozgo , Arjan Bellai , Kela , Gjergji Dema , Edi Abazi , Bilali , Fatmir Shpuza , Fatos Daja , Ervin Lamce , Ilir Zela .

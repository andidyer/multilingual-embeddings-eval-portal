UN mulls second airstrip to move Zaire refugees . United Nations aid agencies in Zaire are considering renovating an old airstrip in dense forest to help evacuate thousands of refugees still trapped in the country . U . N . officials said they were considering renovating Ubundu airstrip , about 100 km south of Kisangani , so that it can take landings by C - 130 aircraft . " It may be that it will be easier to airlift refugees from there rather than bring them all the way to Kisangani , " said a U . N . official on Tuesday . Tens of thousands of refugees are believed by U . N . officials to be still scattered in the forests of eastern Zaire around Ubundu . A group of at least 6 , 000 was discovered at a village around 20 km north of Ubundu at the weekend , many of them on the verge of death . The U . N . has sent home by air more than 22 , 000 refugees from Biaro camp since April 27 after bringing them 40 km north to Kisangani by rail or road . Around 20 , 000 remain at Biaro . A rickety railroad runs between Kisangani and Ubundu , but the train can carry a maximum of only 1 , 200 people a day and the refugees then have to be ferried across the Zaire river to the airport . Aid officials hope a high - level visit to Kisangani by envoys from the European Union , United States and U . N . , starting on Wednesday , will persuade rebel authorities in eastern Zaire to allow greater access to the area . Aid organisations have been barred from travelling by road further than Biaro camp by the Alliance of Forces for the Democratic Liberation of Congo - Zaire ( AFDL ) , the rebel force which since October has captured most of the country . EU envoy Aldo Ajello , U . S . diplomat Howard Wolpe and assistant U . N . high commissioner for refugees Sergio Viera de Mello aim to reach kilometre 52 , where the road from Kisangani to Ubundu runs out . Refugees say hundreds of Rwandan Hutus were killed by rebel soldiers at this point after being attacked and forced to flee their camps on April 21 . Aid officials who travelled by train to Ubundu last week said they noticed a strong smell of rotting corpses as they passed the point . The refugees were among over 300 , 000 who fled west in October from their camps on the Zaire / Rwanda border rather than join over a million other Hutu refugees from Zaire and Tanzania who returned home when Zairean rebels began their offensive . The refugees originally fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape reprisals over the genocide of of an estimated 800 , 000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus .

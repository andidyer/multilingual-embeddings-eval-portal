Hanbo H1 recurring loss at 84 . 1 bln won . South Korea ' s failed Hanbo Steel Co posted 84 . 1 billion won in recurring loss in the first half of calendar 1997 against a 91 . 8 billion won loss a year earlier , a spokesman for the company ' s management said on Monday . The nation ' s second - largest steelmaker has been run by court - appointed management since March after it was declared insolvent in January . A senior official at the public information team for the management said Hanbo recorded 299 . 2 billion won in sales during the January - June period , against 332 . 6 billion won a year ago . He said the company posted a loss even though a court had exempted all responsibilities by Hanbo to redeem its liabilites , which could help reduce financing costs in the company . Rising sales costs were cited as a reason contributing to the loss . After a failed auction due to no bids , creditors rescheduled to sell the steelmaker on July 29 . An accounting company earlier estimated Hanbo ' s liabilities at 6 . 61 trillion won , compared to assets of 4 . 97 trillion .

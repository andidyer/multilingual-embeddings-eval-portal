Olympics - Key Sydney Olympic official sues politician . Sydney ' s second most powerful 2000 Olympic Games organiser on Friday began defamation action against the politician who controls the finances that are paying for the bulk of Games facilities . The court case involved a dispute surrounding the introduction of a bed tax in Sydney , an issue that has badly strained relations between Games organisers and the local New South Wales ( NSW ) government in recent weeks . Before the tax row flared last month , the International Olympic Committee praised the working relationship between the two bodies as a blueprint for future Games . John Coates , senior vice - president of the Games organising body SOCOG , has sought damages against NSW state treasurer Michael Egan in a public falling out between the two officials . " I have already sought an apology and an apology was not forthcoming , so my lawyers served a statement of claim on the treasurer which seeks damages , " Coates told reporters on Friday at a media briefing on preparations for the Games . In a written statement to the New South Wales Supreme Court , Coates said Egan defamed him in June by suggesting his opposition to the bed tax was motivated by his business links with a company that runs a city hotel . Coates has said he opposes the bed tax because it will have an adverse effect of Sydney ' s capacity to host the 2000 Games . Under the bed tax scheme , which will be introduced in September , all hotels in central Sydney will be levied a 10 percent tax on rooms . SOCOG has sought guaranteed access to hotel beds in the city to provide accommodation for IOC officials and sponors during the Games . Since the tax dispute began , the hotel industry has suspended their negotiations , leaving SOCOG with a massive potential accomodation shortfall .

TENNIS - COURIER NAMED TO U . S . DAVIS CUP TEAM FOR QUARTER - FINALS . Former world number one Jim Courier will play for the United States in the Davis Cup tennis quarter - finals against the Netherlands in April , U . S . Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson announced Tuesday . Gullikson did not name the rest of the four - man squad for the April 4 - 6 tie because of uncertainty over injuries to some of his potential recruits and an apparent reluctance to particiapte by other top American players . " Courier ' s performance in our opening - round win in Brazil was fantastic . I haven ' t seen him that focused since he was number one in the world , " Gullikson said from the Palisades Tennis Club in Newport Beach , site of the quarter - final . " I am ecstatic to have him on the team , " added Gullikson of the 18th - ranked Courier . " As far as the remainder of the team , I ' ll have to wait and see who is available and healthy . " Numerous reports have suggested that the top two Americans - - world number one Pete Sampras and third - ranked Michael Chang - - were not interested in playing Davis Cup in the early rounds . Unfortunately for Gullikson , injuries have cut into his deep reserve of American talent . Davis Cup stalwart Todd Martin is unavailable to play the Dutch team after undergoing arthroscopic surgery Tuesday on his right elbow . Andre Agassi has been struggling with an ankle injury , while MaliVai Washington , always available for Davis Cup when called upon , is nursing a knee injury he suffered during a singles win in the first - round against Brazil and re - aggravated last week in Memphis . A United States Tennis Association spokesman said the entire team was expected to be named Tuesday but the injury situation had left Gullikson contemplating his options . According to ITF regulations , Gullikson must name the rest of his team no later than 10 days prior to the tie .

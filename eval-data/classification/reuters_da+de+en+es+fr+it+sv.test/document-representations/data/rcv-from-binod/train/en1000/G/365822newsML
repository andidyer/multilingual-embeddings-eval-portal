Florida girl , switched - at - birth , weds at 18 . Kimberly Mays , the switched - at - birth girl who went to court to " divorce " her biological parents , was married in secret on Saturday , according to a Florida television station . Mays was married near Universal Studios in Orlando , just before 6 p . m . EST ( 2300 GMT ) , WFTV Channel 9 reported . The station aired video of Mays , 18 , and her groom , who was not identified , wearing wedding clothing as they left the ceremony . Both her biological parents , Ernest and Regina Twigg , and the man who raised her as his daughter , Robert Mays , attended the ceremony , the report said . Mays and another girl , the natural daughter of Robert and Barbara Mays , were born within hours of one another in 1978 in a Florida hospital . Somehow the two girls were swapped shortly after their births and went home with the wrong parents . When the child raised by the Twiggs contracted cancer , medical tasks revealed she was not their natural daughter . The girl died , as did Barbara Mays , also of cancer . The Twiggs found Kimberly , but after she broke off contact with them they sued for custody . She sued to " divorce " the Twiggs , and in 1993 , at age 14 , won the right to call Robert Mays her legal father . Books and a television movie followed the court case , but the saga was not yet over . At age 15 , Kimberly then left Robert Mays and moved in with the Twiggs . She later accused Mays of having sexually abused her . A police investigation concluded the charge was not true , and Kimberly recanted . She later moved into a youth shelter . Calls to the families ' lawyers and to Robert Mays were not returned Saturday night .

Protein switch could offer key to arthritis cure . A protein that gives orders to immune system cells could offer hope to sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis , doctors reported on Tuesday . The protein could be used to " switch off " rogue immune system cells that attack the joints in the painful and crippling condition , Roderick Flower and colleagues at the privately funded William Harvey Research Institute in London said . They said developing a drug based on the protein could offer a gentler and more effective treatment for not only rheumatoid arthritis , but similar conditions such as gout . " This opens up the way for new therapeutic agents to mimic this naturally occurring switch - off mechanism , " Dr Mauro Perretti , who led the research , said in a statement . Rheumatoid arthritis , gout and other autoimmune diseases are caused when the body ' s immune system turns on itself . In the case of rheumatoid arthritis , white blood cells respond to a non - existent invasion and , having nothing else to attack , turn on the tissues in the joints . No one knows what causes it , but Flower said his team had identified a protein that can make the white blood cells stop . Writing in the journal Nature Medicine , they said the protein , called lipocortin - 1 , helps balance the immune response . The protein appears on the outside of the white blood cells when they are activated . It appears to balance out signals from other chemicals , known as cytokines , which call for help from white blood cells when the body is infected or damaged in some way . " The body often controls things by giving positive and negative signals together , " Flower , a pharmacologist , said . " It gives more effective control . " The lipocortin protein directly opposes the cytokine signal . " It provides a strong negative signal to the cell and can stop the cell from moving , " Flower said . Tests show that when the protein is completely removed , white blood cells rush too quickly to fight , while when there is an abundance of lipocortin the immune system responds too slowly . Steroids affect lipocortin , which is why they are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis , but have strong side - effects . " Steroids severely clobber the immune system , " Flower said . Flower ' s group hopes to home in on the most active part of the lipocortin molecule and make a gentler drug based on it . " We probably couldn ' t give the protein itself as a drug because it is too complicated to make and can cause ( other ) immune reactions , " he said . " What we are doing now is trying to zero down on the smallest part of molecule that has a biological effect . " That could be made into a tablet that sufferers could take when they feel a flare - up coming on . The institute , based at London ' s St Bartholomew ' s Hospital , said the research was funded by the Wellcome Trust charity and Japan ' s ONO Pharmaceutical Co .

Wildlife group sues for shorebird habitat protection . A wildlife advocacy group Wednesday sued the Interior Department for failing to protect habitat of an endangered Great Lakes shorebird . The Defenders of Wildlife said that without more protections , the Great Lakes piping plover - - a small migratory bird with a sand - coloured upper body , white underside , and orange legs - - could disappear . Last summer just 23 pairs nested in northern Michigan ' s Great Lakes , the primary nesting area , it said . The U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , an Interior Department agency , since 1985 has listed the bird as endangered in its Great Lakes breeding grounds . The lawsuit said the Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act by not designating the plovers ' winter and summer habitat as " critical , " giving more protection from development . The bird is listed as threatened , a less stringent designation , when it is in its Gulf Coast wintering grounds where it mingles with Great Plains and Atlantic piping plovers , which also are listed as threatened . " Critical habitat designation ensures that federal agency actions , such as beach dredging and road building , do not jeopardise the existence of the piping plover , " Bill Snape , Defenders of Wildlife ' s legal director , said in a statement . But Kevin Stubbs , a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist , said the agency does not know enough about where the Great Lakes plover , as well as Great Plains and Atlantic plovers , spend winters to designate their critical habitat .

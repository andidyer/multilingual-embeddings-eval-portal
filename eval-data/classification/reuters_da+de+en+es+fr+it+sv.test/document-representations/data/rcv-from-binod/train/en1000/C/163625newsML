INP hopes to reach 90 pct of NZ ' s W & H . Independent Newspapers Plc Managing Director of International Operations Brendan Hopkins said on Tuesday the Dublin - based group was hopeful of gaining 90 percent of New Zealand publisher Wilson and Horton through its current bid . " Obviously we ' d be hopeful of getting to the 90 percent , " Hopkins said in a television interview . Asked if INP would look at extending the bid , which expires on Friday , Hopkins said : " Obviously our advisers are looking at that very closely at the moment . If we extend , we would have to give a 48 hour notice period . I think a lot of it depends on the flow of shareholder acceptances that are still coming in . " Ninety percent is the level at which INP could compulsorily acquire the rest of the shares . Hopkins said INP was currently at 69 percent but " the acceptances are now accelerating quite significantly " . He said most of the outstanding shares were held by institutions . INP , through its unit Independent Press Communications Ltd , is bidding for all of Wilson and Horton at NZ $ 11 . 00 or 1 . 375 exchangeable INP shares for each W & H share . Independent Newspapers and family trusts linked to principal Tony O ' Reilly held 45 . 15 percent of Wilson and Horton prior to the current bid . Wilson and Horton shares were trading up a cent at $ 11 . 01 on thin volume . - - Wellington Newsroom ( 64 4 ) 4734746

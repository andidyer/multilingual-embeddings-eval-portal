Austria mulls Creditanstalt bid . Austrian banking was turned on its head on Wednesday when market leader Bank Austria revealed it was considering making a bid for arch rival , privatisation candidate Creditanstalt - Bankverein . A source close to Bank Austria ' s supervisory board privately confirmed media reports of a planned 16 billion schillings ( $ 1 . 5 billion ) takeover bid to be discussed at Wednesday ' s board meeting . " The headlines are not wrong , " the source told Reuters . Spokesman Heimo Hackel said an announcement was likely after 1700 GMT . According to tabloid daily Neue Kronen Zeitung , Bank Austria was ready to pay 804 schillings for each of the government ' s 19 . 9 million Creditanstalt ordinary shares , representing 70 percent of voting stock . That is well above the market price of 719 . 5 schillings and a reported 720 - 730 schillings bid lodged by an Austro - German - Italian group led by insurer EA - Generali . Analysts forecast Finance Minister Viktor Klima , desperate to raise fresh revenues to plug the nation ' s budget deficit , would have difficulty turning down such a generous offer . If successful , the takeover could change the Alpine nation ' s overcrowded banking landscape and abruptly end a 50 - year tradition of sharing spoils on party political lines . Creditanstalt , founded in 1863 by the Rothschild family , has long been an ally of junior coalition partner the conservative People ' s Party . Bank Austria , controlled by the City of Vienna , is a bastion of the ruling Social Democrats . " This is a chance to free Creditanstalt , hostage of the People ' s Party , and end the " red " domination of Bank Austria , " far - right opposition leader Joerg Haider said . But Creditanstalt , once banker to the Habsburg rulers of the Austro - Hungarian empire , gave notice it would not become an easy target for Bank Austria . Creditanstalt ' s board and conservative politicians have publicly supported EA - Generali ' s bid to buy into the bank . " This plan will destroy an attractive bank and open the door to foreigners . It is not a privatisation but under the guise of a privatisation will polarise the whole sector , " said one executive , talking on condition of anonymity . Numerous international suitors for Creditanstalt have come and gone in the six years since the sell - off began , their ardour dampened by Austrian mistrust of foreign ownership . Analysts doubted that a marriage with Bank Austria was any more likely to bring the desired happy ending . " Looking at the way these two banks operate , I can see a Bank Austria takeover becoming a disaster , " said one analyst who declined to be named . James Capel analyst Victoria Maxwell said the success of the venture would depend on management willingness to reform . She noted that Bank Austria had made little headway in integrating 1994 acquisition GiroCredit . With total assets of more than 1 . 3 billion schillings a Bank Austria with Creditanstalt would dwarf its domestic competitors but remain relatively small by international standards , analysts said . They added a deal would only succeed if the banks grasped the nettle and set about cutting staff and closing branches . " But Bank Austria ' s employees are well protected under law so any cuts will be on the Creditanstalt side , " Maxwell said . Creditanstalt employees announced on Wednesday they would fight for their jobs every step of the way . The EA - Generali consortium is expected to finalise its bid for Creditanstalt on Thursday but experts ruled out an increase in the group ' s offer .

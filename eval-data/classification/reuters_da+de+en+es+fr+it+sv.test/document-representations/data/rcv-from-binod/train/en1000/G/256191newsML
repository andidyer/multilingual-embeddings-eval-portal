German parliament set to approve new Bosnia force . The Bonn parliament on Friday debated giving its soldiers the final go - ahead to join a new Bosnia peacekeeping force , the first time German combat forces will take full part in a ground mission beside Western allies . With a large part of the opposition also in favour , Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s government seemed certain to get an overwhelming majority for the motion to send some 3 , 000 German soldiers to join the NATO - led Stabilisation Force ( SFOR ) . The 18 - month deployment will mark the first time united Germany sends combat troops to serve on the ground in another country . Bonn had about 4 , 000 troops in the multinational IFOR mission whose mandate expires on December 20 . But it limited their tasks to logistical jobs such as bridge building and running a field hospital because of fears they might revive memories of Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia in World War Two . " We have now seen that , contrary to some people ' s fears , our soldiers ' presence is welcomed by all sections of the population , " Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told parliament . " The end of our special role is a relief , not only for our soldiers . " Germany is fully living up to its obligations to NATO and the U . N . - - good news for all those who believe in a common European purpose and stronger international cooperation . " The new German contingent will be the fourth - largest after those of the United States , Britain and France , and work closely with French troops in the French - administered sector of Bosnia . For the first time it will include infantry and armoured vehicle - borne reconnaissance forces ready and equipped to face combat situations . Since World War Two , the only German combat troops to have served on the ground abroad were the communist East German forces sent to then - Czechoslovakia to help the Soviet Red Army put down an anti - communist uprising in 1968 . Defence Minister Volker Ruehe noted that the end of the Cold War had not in fact lessened the risks for the German soldiers who used to be the capitalist West ' s front line of defence . " Our soldiers have had to live with the danger to life and limb for several years now . . . During the East - West confrontation there was less danger for the individual soldier , " he told national ARD television . The United Nations Security Council got the German government out of a tight spot by approving a mandate for SFOR late on Thursday . The opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) had threatened to boycott Friday ' s debate if the Security Council resolution had not been passed , arguing that parliament had a right to know exactly what kind of mission it was saying ' yes ' to . " We are not taking just any old decision , " SPD foreign affairs spokesman Guenter Verheugen told parliament . " It may mean that we must take responsibility for our young people losing their health or their lives . Can any one of us then come back and say ' I didn ' t know what the mandate was ' ? "

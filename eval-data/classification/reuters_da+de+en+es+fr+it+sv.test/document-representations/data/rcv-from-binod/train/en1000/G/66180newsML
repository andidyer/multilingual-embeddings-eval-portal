Canada jazz star says victimized by Helms - Burton . A Canadian jazz star whose music is rooted in the sounds of Cuba begins an abbreviated U . S . tour on Saturday , saying her career is threatened by U . S . - Cuban political tension . Toronto - based saxophonist and flutist Jane Bunnett , who has been playing in Cuba for more than a decade , said she is an indirect victim of the controversial U . S . Helms - Burton law , which seeks to punish foreign companies that invest in Cuba . Helms - Burton , which was signed by President Bill Clinton in March after Cuban MiG fighters downed two private planes piloted by Cuban - Americans , does not target culture . But Bunnett said in a telephone interview she is convinced fear of anti - Cuban sentiment prompted U . S . concert promoters to cancel five of her concerts at colleges set for this month . All five were canceled shortly after the bill was passed . The tour begins on Saturday in Wausau , Wisconsin , with the other U . S . dates set for Rochester , New York , and Chicago . Bunnett will tour with the 16 - piece Cuban band Oba - Ilu . She had been slated to release a CD with Oba - Ilu but that plan was also scapped shortly after Helms - Burton became law . " Helms - Burton isn ' t supposed to affect cultural and sports activities - - it ' s primarily dealing with business , " said Bunnett , who won a Juno Award , Canada ' s version of the Grammy , for her 1992 recording " Spirits of Havana . " Her latest CD , " The Cuban Piano Masters , " was released in August . " I think people just panicked , " she said . She said she had to scramble to add Canadian cities to the tour to make up the lost revenue and the Chicago venue had to be changed after the Cuban - American promoter received bomb threats . Martha Woods , who booked the tour for New York - based Jonathan Wentworth Associates , said it was impossible to link Helms - Burton with the cancellations . She said promoters had not signed on the dotted line and two educational services that were part of a group planning to bring in the band got " cold feet . " The Canadian government has been a vocal opponent of the Helms - Burton law , which includes a provision to bar senior executives of foreign firms entry into the United States if they are found to be " trafficking " in property confiscated by the Castro government after Cuba ' s 1959 revolution . The same week the U . S . concerts were scrapped , a record deal with Sony Music ' s Canadian division , which was to release a CD recorded in February by Bunnett and Oba - Ilu , fell through at the 11th hour , Bunnett said . " It was pretty important for the deal to be working along with Sony in the U . S . , " she said . " The lawyers had come up with a mutual contract that was pretty much ready to be signed . So I find it strangely coincidental . " But Randy Sharrard , Sony Music Canada ' s director of special marketing , said the company ' s abandonment of the deal was " a business decision " and not due to Helms - Burton . " Basically it was a matter of numbers and it had nothing to do with politics , " Sharrard said . " It was basically a coincidence that it all happened at the same time . "

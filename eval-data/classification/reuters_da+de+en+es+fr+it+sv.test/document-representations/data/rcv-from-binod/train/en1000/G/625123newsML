Singapore leaders win huge damages for libel . A Singapore court awarded Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and senior colleagues in the ruling party Singapore $ 8 . 08 ( US $ 5 . 65 ) million in damages on Thursday in their libel cases against a political foe . Tang Liang Hong , who fled the country after losing in January general elections , was ordered in a formal judgement to pay the damages to Goh and 10 other members of the ruling People ' s Action party ( PAP ) for calling them liars . " It cannot be disputed that in terms of aggravation , these 13 cases have no equal , " the court said in a formal judgement on the amount of damages to be awarded against Tang , who lost the cases in March when he did not return to defend himself . " The more enormous , outrageous , scandalous or scurrilous the defamation , and / or aggravation , the greater the damages , " the court said in explaining its award of record damages . The PAP leaders demanded aggravated damages of S $ 12 . 9 million , saying that Tang had continued to libel them in media interviews from abroad . Tang had called them liars during the election campaign for calling him a " Chinese chauvinist " .

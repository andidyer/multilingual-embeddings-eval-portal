Lufthansa loses out to rivals in cheap ticket war . Deutsche Lufthansa AG has lost 250 , 000 clients and some 50 million marks in sales to discount ticket offers in Germany from rival European airlines in the first half of 1996 , Lufthansa ' s top executive for marketing Hemjoe Klein told a travel agents meeting . Klein said airlines such as British Airways and Air France had under - cut Lufthansa prices in Germany by up to 45 percent since the start of 1996 . " Traffic is being siphoned off with cheap offers . The German market is being reduced to a connecting function for London , Paris , Amersterdam or Zurich , " he told the meeting of German travel agents . Klein said Lufthansa had been forced to react with low - priced summer and autumn flights to retain its share of the leisure market and had generated about 280 , 000 additional bookings with a special summer campaign . Competition will grow between global airline alliances and Klein said he expected more competition from a British Airways telephone office in Bremen that would start to sell American Airlines tickets under a planned joint venture . From November 1 , Lufthansa will introduce electronic ticketing throughout Germany for credit card sales and would add new functions to its Chipcard smart card such as telephone , credit card and hotel card functions , he said . Electronic ticketing will also be introduced on routes from Frankfurt to London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle in a pilot test from November , according to Lufthansa information . Klein said the meeting with the agents was necessary to smooth over misunderstandings over commission payments on airport fees , the special summer campaign , sales through the Internet and to discuss future cooperation deals . The German airline sold 85 percent of its tickets through travel agents , who were responsible for some six billion marks in revenue for the airline , he said . Multimedia and sales through the internet , in the most optimistic forecasts , would grow to about 20 to 30 percent of sales by 2006 , Klein said . - - Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525

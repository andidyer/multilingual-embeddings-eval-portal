Hungary BUX jumps to 3rd high in a row . A bull run on the Budapest Stock Exchange speeded up on Wednesday , fuelled by Tuesday ' s benign macroeconomic news , boosting the BUX index to a third successive record high , traders said . The BUX index finished at a preliminary 6 , 779 . 59 points , up 182 . 31 points or 2 . 76 percent . " Certainly Tuesday ' s good news , the reduction of monthly crawling peg devaluation to one percent ( from 1 . 1 percent from August 15 ) and Hungary ' s upgrading , is behind the rally , " said Andrea Keresztesi of ABN - AMRO Hoare Govett . Investors ' appetite bolstered several leading stocks to new record highs . Among them were the highest capitalised oil and gas company MOL which surged to 4 , 350 forints before closing at 4 , 335 , up 245 ; OTP Bank which rallied to 4 , 955 forints before closing at 4 , 900 , up 220 ; and the two chemicals , TVK and BorsodChem . Traders said MOL was apparently benefiting from Monday ' s announcement to raise the quarterly wholesale gas prices by 13 . 5 percent . Keresztesi and other traders earlier said fresh foreign capital seemed to have come into the country . Final turnover figures were not yet available but it was outstanding , partly bolstered by position closing on the futures market , traders said . " I think many investors closed positions , buying BUX futures back and selling stocks , " Keresztesi said . Position closings bolstered turnover and reduced prices only temporarily . Last prices in BUX futures were above Tuesday ' s settlement prices , with September BUX closing at 6 , 990 points , compared to Tuesday ' s settlement price of 6 , 855 . One trader said some profit - takings would be a logical step for Thursday ' s session but seeing unsatisfied demand this was not sure to happen .

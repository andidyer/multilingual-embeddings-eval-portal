Richmond Fed most hawkish , Minneapolis least - study . The Richmond Federal Reserve Bank was the most hawkish of the central bank ' s regional banks and the Minneapolis Fed the least during the period from 1993 to 1996 , the Financial Markets Center said on Monday . The non - profit institute based that conclusion on an analysis of discount rate requests by the regional Reserve banks during that period . The boards of the individual Fed regional banks periodically submit requests for changes in the discount rate to the central bank ' s Board here in Washington for a decision . " Four Reserve Banks - - Richmond , St . Louis , Kansas City and Boston - - accounted for nearly two - thirds of systemwide requests to raise the discount rate , " the center said . " The Richmond Fed alone accounted for nearly one - quarter . " It said that nearly two - thirds of all requests for discount rate cuts from 1993 through 1996 came from two regional Fed banks - - Cleveland and Minneapolis . " The Minneapolis Fed ranks as the most accomodative , " it added . It ranked the regional banks in the following way , starting from the most hawkish to the least : Richmond , St . Louis , Kansas City , Boston , San Francisco , Chicago , New York , Philadelphia , Dallas , Cleveland , Atlanta and Minneapolis . The Virginia - based center , which receives the bulk of its funding from charitable foundations , said that the pattern of some regional Fed banks ' discount rate requests contrasted sharply with their reputations . The Boston Fed , often regarded as the most dovish Reserve Bank , was actually one of the more aggressive in pushing for higher rates , it said . By contrast , the Minneapolis Fed - - typecast as a leading hawk because its President , Gary Stern , dissented in favor of higher rates several times last year - - showed up as most dovish under the center ' s calculations . Some of the other conclusions of the center ' s study : - - The Reserve Banks have limited influence within the Fed . Between March 1994 and October 1996 , the Fed Board here approved five discount rate changes in response to requests from six or more regional banks . But it turned down seven . - - Discount rate requests did not always reflect relative economic trends in Fed districts . - - Votes cast by Reserve Bank Presidents at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee did not always correspond to the discount rate recommendations by their Banks ' boards .

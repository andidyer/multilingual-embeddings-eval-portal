FEATURE - Evangelical Christians flex political muscles . In recent years , U . S . politics have been transformed by the emergence of a powerful , well - organised movement of conservative evangelical Christians determined to reshape society in their image . Organised under the umbrella of the Christian Coalition , evangelical activists have stormed the ramparts of the Republican Party . In several states , they now dominate the party apparatus and they were a key element in helping Republicans take control of Congress in 1994 . " The Christian Coalition has had a huge impact , " said Ralph Reed , the organisation ' s cherub - faced executive director , who sent tremors through the movement last month by announcing his intention to resign next September . " Eight years ago , those who shared a belief in God and whose political views were informed by that faith were often treated as second class citizens . They were thought to be a nominal force in American politics , " Reed said in his resignation statement . " But today all that has changed . Religious conservatives are now widely acknowledged to be one of the most potent and effective forces in American politics . " Founded in 1989 by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson , who ran unsuccessfully for president the previous year , the group grew out of a belief that perhaps as many as 60 million evangelical Christians lacked a voice in U . S . politics . FEELING OF EXCLUSIONMany not only felt excluded from the political system but also alienated from a popular culture they saw as undermining traditional moral values and spreading evil . Working at a grassroots level , the Coalition claims a mailing list of 1 . 9 million dues - paying members and an annual budget of $ 27 million . In the 1996 elections , it distributed 45 million voter guides through a network of 125 , 000 churches . At Christian Coalition headquarters , officials can now call up maps of every locality in the United States on CD - ROM discs and pinpoint each supporter on the street they live . The Christian Coalition insists it is non - partisan . To protect its tax - exempt status , it says it does not tell people who to vote for but merely seeks to inform them . The Federal Election Commission disputes this and has taken it to court . Christian involvement in U . S . politics is not new . But Christian fundamentalists were quiescent for several decades after the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 , when they lost a battle to stop the teaching of evolution is schools . The trial harmed them in the eyes of the intellectual and media elites . The change began in the 1970s . Evangelical Christians had grown vastly in numbers to the point where they comprised over a quarter of the population . Many had also managed to join the middle class , giving them access to the educational tools and resources needed for effective political action . SCORES OF NEW GROUPSIn recent years , scores of religious political action groups have appeared , many with their own radio and television outlets . Many of these organisations coordinate their activities in a loose right - wing coalition . The most important consequence of the emergence of the Christian right has been the transformation of the Republican Party . Reed believes evangelical Christians have become the largest single power bloc within the party . Interviewed in Christian Coalition headquarters , he said Christian Coalition supporters made up about 19 percent of the total electorate and around 40 percent of voters in last year ' s Republican Party presidential primaries , where the party chose its candidate for president . In several states , including Texas , evangelical voters may now constitute a majority of the Republican electorate . That means evangelicals now hold a virtual veto over Republican nominees for president and vice president . " They are not yet strong enough to impose their candidate on the party and get him or her elected but they can deny the nomination to someone they find objectionable , " said John Green , a political scientist from the University of Akron who has studied the evangelical movement . At the same time , there are clear limits on the ability of evangelical conservatives to get what they want . In last year ' s election , the Christian Coalition had little influence on Republican nominee Bob Dole once he was nominated and was powerless to prevent President Bill Clinton winning . Moderate Republican commentator James Pinkerton argued in a post - election analysis that the Christian right may actually have cost Republicans votes . " What Reed and others on the religious right understandably choose to ignore is the damage done to the Republican Party by the perception that the party is in the thrall of zealots , " he wrote . Reed has tried hard to reach out to Catholics , blacks and Jews . He has frequently apologised for the past racism of Christian conservatives and preached a new spirit of repentance and reconciliation . But his efforts have met with much scepticism and little success . However Green said that even without such alliances , the political power of the evangelical movement had not yet reached its peak . " They still haven ' t reached all the people they could reach . The explosion of growth may be over but slower , steady growth still lies ahead , " he said .

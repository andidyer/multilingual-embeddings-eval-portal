Hasbro Q2 EPS helped by line of boys ' toys . Hasbro Inc said Thursday that its second quarter earnings nearly doubled , largely because of strength in sales of products that cater to boys . In the period , the company reported net income of $ 13 million , or $ 0 . 10 per share , on revenues of $ 583 . 9 million . In the same period in the prior year , the company reported net income of $ 6 million , or $ 0 . 05 per share , on revenues of $ 511 . 6 million . " Revenue growth continued to be primarily driven by the strength of our range of boys ' products , including those associated with three of our major entertainment properties , Star Wars , Jurassic Park and Batman , " Chairman and Chief Executive Alan Hassenfeld said in a statement . Hassenfeld said that its acquisition in May of OddzOn Products and Cap Toys also contributed to revenue growth in the United States markets . Those acquisitions brought into the Hasbro fold of toys Koosh balls , Vortex sports toys and Cap ' s line of interactive candy . " Internationally , we experienced significant local currency growth in Canada , Mexico and Latin America , where we have three newly established joint ventures , as well as more moderate growth in several other countries , " he added . That growth was tempered , however , by the effect of the strong dollar , which siphoned away about $ 10 million , he said . " Our significant earnings growth this quarter was wholly attributable to our pre - acquisition businesses since , as planned , the OddzOn / Cap units were not accretive , " Hassenfeld said .

IRA ' s Sinn Fein sharply increases N . Ireland vote . The IRA ' s political wing Sinn Fein increased its share of Northern Ireland votes to a record 17 percent on Friday in local elections which ended their Protestant rivals ' domination of Belfast city council . Sinn Fein , which seeks to end British rule of Northern Ireland , raised its share of the votes by nearly 5 . 0 percent , the third successive election at which it has increased its electoral support , which was 12 percent in 1993 . The main losers were Sinn Fein ' s idelogical opposites , Protestant Unionists who want the disputed province to remain part of the United Kingdom and who have held control over key city councils for decades . " This marks a new era for this city of Belfast , " said Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams . " We will end an era of domination and bring in a new , inclusive era , " he told reporters . Sinn Fein ' s showing raised the prospect of a Catholic Mayor being chosen for the first time in decades . Unionists won 25 seats to the council and Nationalists and their allies 26 . The party polled around 11 percent before 1990 , 12 percent in the last such polls in 1993 , 15 percent in a vote for a " Peace Forum " discussion body one year ago and 16 percent in Britain ' s May 1 elections . But Sinn Fein ' s victory , which followed the election of Adams and associate Martin McGuinness to the British parliament this month , was contested by several parties which accused it of cheating . " There is only one party in this province which could mount a military - style operation and we all know who that is , " said the SDLP ' s Mark Atwood . He was referring to the Irish Republican Army , which is at war with Britain to end British rule . Sinn Fein says it is a separate organisation with a common goal . Northern Ireland ' s chief electoral officer , Richard Bradley , said there were " grounds for believing that the allegations are true " and said an " orchestrated campaign of postal and proxy votes " had been uncovered . He said an investigation was being carried out in Northern Ireland , where legend has it that the electorate follows the saying : " Vote early and vote often . " Adams dismissed the allegations of cheating . " That ' s a whinge and they should stop whingeing . I am telling you there has been no vote - rigging by Sinn Fein , he said . Sinn Fein raised its share of Belfast city council seats by three to 13 , equalling the number won by the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party . Councils administer health , education and other domestic matters . The SDLP and Sinn Fein together captured for the first time the councils of Fermanagh and the dormitory town of Cookstown . Sinn Fein ' s showing capped a week in which British government officials held talks with Adams and McGuinness for the first time since the IRA ended a 17 - month ceasefire in February 1996 with a London bomb which killed two . Further exploratory talks are to be held with the new British government but Sinn Fein is barred from Belfast peace talks until the IRA calls a complete end to a conflict in which 3 , 200 people have been killed .

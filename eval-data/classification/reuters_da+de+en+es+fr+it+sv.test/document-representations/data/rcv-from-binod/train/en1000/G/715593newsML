SOCCER - BAGGIO " 99 PERCENT CERTAIN " TO JOIN PARMA . AC Milan ' s Roberto Baggio will almost certainly join Parma rather than English premier league club Derby County , his agent said on Wednesday . " Baggio from Milan to Parma is a deal which is 99 percent concluded , " Antonio Caliendo told reporters after meeting officials at Milan . He said Baggio , who has already announced his departure from Milan , would meet Parma officials in person later on Wednesday . " I think Baggio will accept with enthusiasm , " Caliendo said . " Last November , when Parma tried to sign him , Roberto accepted the move but nothing was done because of a question of money . " Baggio has a thirst for victory and playing for Parma in the Champions ' League in the season before the World Cup would be very important to him . " Baggio , once the world ' s most expensive player and arguably the best known Italian footballer of his generation , has been linked to several clubs both in and outside Italy since he confirmed he was leaving Milan . He was reportedly set to move to Barcelona and was then linked to serie A sides Vicenza and Napoli . Earlier this week he was the subject of an audacious transfer bid from modest English side Derby . Baggio has always said he would dearly love to play for Italy in next year ' s World Cup in France . A season with Parma , who qualified for the Champions ' League as Italian runners - up last season , would give him the high - profile exposure he needs to reclaim his place in the Italian national side .

Renaissance falls on results disappointment . Shares of Renaissance Energy Ltd sank in busy trade on Friday after key aspects of the company ' s 1996 financial results released late Thursday disappointed investors . Renaissance ' s results , which included higher than expected finding and development costs and lower forecast production growth in the first half , were the latest evidence of a growing bearish trend in Canadian oils , analysts said . The company ' s stock fell 3 . 25 to 38 . 90 with 1 . 2 million in late Toronto Stock Exchange trade . Renaissance , viewed as one of the top performing companies in the Canadian energy sector , rang up 1996 net earnings of C $ 180 million or C $ 1 . 61 a share in 1996 , sharply higher than the C $ 63 million or C $ 0 . 66 reported in 1995 . Cash flow grew to C $ 5 . 01 from C $ 3 . 30 per share the year before . However , operational performance fell below analyst predictions . " They showed very disappointing finding and development costs for ' 96 , " Peter Linder , analyst with brokerage CIBC Wood Gundy , said . The company reported an average finding and development cost for 1996 of C $ 8 . 40 per barrel of oil equivalent of proven reserves . The figure was about C $ 2 higher than what was reported in 1995 . " Number two , it looks like their first - half production numbers will be somewhat lower than the street ' s expectation because of the very cold January , " Linder said . Renaissance said it expected its production to average 92 , 500 barrels a day of oil and 450 million cubic feet a day of gas for all of 1997 . But first - half oil output was pegged at 85 , 000 barrels a day because severe weather early this year , the coming spring breakup and annual facility maintenance was expected to defer many production gains until later in the year , the company said . Linder said poorer results from Renaissance would likely have a chilling effect among investors , especially with weakening oil and natural gas prices . " I ' m convinced , with the market sentiment quite negative on the oil and gas sector , that the street is looking for almost any excuse to bail out , " he said .

Explosion rocks ship off eastern Sri Lanka . An explosion rocked a ship carrying flour to the eastern Sri Lankan port of Trincomalee , military officials said on Thursday . They said the explosion occurred early on Thursday when the ship bringing in flour from Argentina was in the outer harbour at Trincomalee , 240 km ( 150 miles ) northeast of the capital Colombo . It was not immediately known what had caused the blast but officials said naval boats had been sent to investigate . On Wednesday , the Sri Lanka navy intercepted a flotilla of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebel boats in waters off the eastern coast and sank seven of them . Trincomalee is a major naval base where the rebels sank two naval boats in April 1995 , ending the last round of peace talks with the government .

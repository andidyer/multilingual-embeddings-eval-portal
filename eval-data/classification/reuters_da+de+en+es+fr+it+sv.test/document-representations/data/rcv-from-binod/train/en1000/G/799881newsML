India commemorates freedom with mixed feelings . India prepared to celebrate a half century of independence on Thursday , lauding the nation ' s commitment to democracy and economic progress but chastened by its unfulfilled legacy and persistent poverty . Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral , his four - month - old government riven by disagreement , emphasised India ' s accomplishments during 50 years of freedom . " It ' s been a journey or a transformation of approximately a billion diverse people , " he told Asian News International in an interview . " Starting from scratch , we have built up ourselves . " " There is a great future , " he said . " When you look at any aspect of Indian activity - - space , satellites or software - - youth shines bright . " But a bomb blast triggered by militants in the troubled northeastern region on Thursday was a violent reminder of India ' s continuing struggle against separatist violence . Seven people were killed and eight injured when the device exploded on a train track in Assam state , derailing a passenger carriage . It was the latest attack in a mounting campaign of insurgency - related violence in the northeastern region , where dozens of separatists groups are fighting India rule . The army , paramilitary units and police in the region , as well as in rebellious Kashmir and the capital New Delhi , have tightened security ahead of independence celebrations . An evening parade of thousands of citizens through the capital and a special midnight session of parliament were to mark the 50th anniversary of India ' s " tryst with destiny " . At the stroke of midnight on August 14 - 15 , 1947 , more than two centuries of British colonial rule over the vast subcontinent came to an end . In the words of the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru , India awoke to life and freedom . " A moment comes which comes but rarely in history , when we step out of from the old to the new , when an age ends , and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance , " he said . India ' s current rulers were to gather at midnight in the same parliament hall where Nehru spoke . There they will listen to recordings of his words and those of the nation ' s spiritual father , Mahatma Gandhi , who was gunned down five months after his dream of independence was realised . From the start , India ' s independence was tinged with sadness as the stark division of the subcontinent into two nations - - India and Pakistan - - was accompanied by the massacre of hundreds of thousands and the uprooting of millions of families . Freedom at midnight in August 1947 was followed two months later by war with Pakistan over Kashmir . Three months after that , Gandhi was shot dead by a Hindu fanatic . This year ' s celebrations , too , have been bitter - sweet . " In the last election , 350 million people voted , a phenomenon unparalleled in the world , " Gujral said . " We have proved that democracy is the surest way for transformation . " But Outlook magazine said : " The legacy of the greatest mass movement of the 20th century has been squandered . The soaring hope and joy of 1947 is today tempered with cynicism and despair . " A cartoon in the Times of India captured the cynicism , fanned by corruption cases against leading politicians . A politician in the cartoon tells a rally : " In the past we used to promise to remove poverty , unemployment , sickness . Now , in addition , we will eradicate corruption , crime , lawlessness . "

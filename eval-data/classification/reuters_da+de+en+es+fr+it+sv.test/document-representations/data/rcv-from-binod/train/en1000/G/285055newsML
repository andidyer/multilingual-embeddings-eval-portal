BULGARIAN OPPOSITION HOLDS BELGRADE - STYLE PROTEST . Thousands of Bulgarian opposition protesters calling for early elections beat pans and blew whistles in a huge Belgrade - style protest outside the headquarters of the ruling Socialist party in Sofia on Friday . Demonstrators threw eggs , firecrackers and stones , breaking two windows in the Pozitano Street office building and cracking a third . They carried candles , and rattled drink cans filled with coins made virtually worthless by the collapse of the lev . Hundreds of riot police with helmets and shields deployed outside the building , where party officials were meeting to elect a new executive bureau . " In the name of Bulgaria , in the name of our future and our children , we demand early elections , " Ivan Kostov , leader of the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces ( UDF ) , told the crowd . He said the rally marked the start of a campaign of street protests . Protesters , estimated by witnesses at more than 10 , 000 , marched from the National Palace of Culture carrying banners reading " Communists ruined the country " and " Let ' s get rid of the Communist terror " . Kostov urged them not to respond to provocation . At one point some demonstrators tried unsuccesfully to break through police lines but the protesters eventually dispersed peacefully . The Socialist party was formed by leading Communists after the collapse of one - party rule in 1989 . Prime minister and party leader Zhan Videnov resigned on December 21 after severe criticism of his management of the economy during his two years in office . A new Socialist cabinet is expected to be formed by mid - January but the opposition wants elections due in December 1998 to be brought forward . Earlier on Friday , parliament began debating a " salvation declaration " presented by the opposition last month . The UDF says a fixed exchange rate regime under discussion with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) will fail under the present government and it wants a new central bank board appointed to implement the currency board mechanism . It wants parliament disbanded immediately and elections to be held in March , and negotiations with the IMF and World Bank on an economic programme to be conducted by an all - party team . Krassimir Premyanov , head of the Socialists ' parliamentary group , said the ruling party was prepared to discuss the proposals with the opposition and to work out a joint position .

Abbey sees little impact from interest hike . Britain ' s second largest housing finance lender , Abbey National Plc said on Monday its decision to raise interest rates by a quarter of one percent will have " little impact " on the housing market . The Abbey said its move was intended to deliver better rates of interest to its 12 million savers who will benefit from the increase from January 1 . Charles Toner , the Abbey ' s Deputy Chief Executive , said in a statement : " We wanted to increase rates for savers , who outnumber borrowers seven to one . " The mortgage rate increase will have little impact on the housing market which is already showing strong signs of improvement . " The rate rise relates to the last quarter - point hike in bank base rates six weeks ago . At that time , most leading lenders adopted a wait - and - see policy until the government announced next year ' s spending plans to avoid to costly changes in quick succession . The rise , announced on Sunday , brings the Abbey ' s rate to 7 . 29 percent for mortgages below 60 , 000 pounds , up from 7 . 04 percent , and comes into effect immediately for new applicants and from December 18 for existing borrowers . - - London Newsroom

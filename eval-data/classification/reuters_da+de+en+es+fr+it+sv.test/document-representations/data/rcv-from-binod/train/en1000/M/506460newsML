COMEX copper settles lower as stock drop ignored . COMEX copper ended weaker in dull , lackluster thin trading , as tags slipped on technical selling amid a dearth of fresh fundamental news , and a further stock drop on LME was shrugged off , traders said . Short - term bearish sentiment in the equity market lay behind the pullback across the board in base metals as technical selling followed through from last week ' s heavy fund liquidation , John Gross of the Copper Journal said . " If the stock market can steady itself up a little bit in the short term , then we should possibly see an upside correction in metal prices , " Gross added . May COMEX copper settled 1 . 00 cent weaker at 105 . 45 cents per pound , well off the day ' s low of 104 . 00 cents . Spot April went out 1 . 20 cents lower at 106 . 65 cents . LME reported on Monday that stocks fell 1 , 775 tonnes to 157 , 900 tonnes . The financial markets were awaiting Tuesday ' s consumer prices for March , when a hike of 0 . 2 percent was forecast by analysts . ( ( Huw Jones , New York Commodity Desk 212 - 859 - 1646 ) )

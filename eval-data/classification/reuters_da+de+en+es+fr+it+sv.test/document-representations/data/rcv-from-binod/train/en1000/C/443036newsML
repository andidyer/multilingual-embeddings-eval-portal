PanEnergy sets Chicago to East Coast line . PanEnergy Corp said Friday it plans a pipeline project called Spectrum , that will provide up to 500 , 000 dekatherms per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity from the Chicago area to the East Coast . PanEnergy ' s four interstate pipelines - - Texas Eastern Transmission Corp , Algonquin Gas Transmission Co , Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co , and Trunkline Gas Company - - will deliver the natural gas from the Chicago are a to the growing East Coast markets of New York City , Philadelphia and Newark . It said Spectrum project service can be phased in as early as November 1 , 1998 , with the full capacity being available two years later . The Spectrum project will use newly constructed capacity combined with existing capacity that has been or is expected to be released by shippers to the PanEnergy pipelines . The company said new facility construction will be limited by expanding existing pipelines only where necessary , which will minimize environmental impact . Spectrum project capacity may also include capacity on the Excelsior pipeline project into New York City , which PanEnergy announced Thursday . To simplify business transactions through its four pipelines , PanEnergy is offering Spectrum customers the ability to move natural gas with a convenient single nomination and invoice . Requests for Spectrum capacity will be accepted by the PanEnergy pipelines in a public open season scheduled for April . At the close of the open season , the PanEnergy pipelines will evaluate the extent new facilities may be required to satisfy open season requests , taking into account any unsubscribed capacity , the company said .

Westmark to spin off units as dividend . Westmark Group Holdings Inc said Thursday that part of its subsidiary , Green World Technologies Inc , will be spun off as a shareholder dividend within the next few months . Green World makes the Talon Refrigerant Management System , which is an add - on to existing air conditioning equipment that conserves energy , said the company . In December , Westmark said it received an unsolicited letter of intent to purchase Green World from a New York / Florida - based investment banking firm . The company said it has decided that shareholders will be better served and will gain value by spinning off a portion of the subsidiary and financing the company as a separate entity . The company expects that Green World will become a public entity and will seek listing on Nasdaq . It added that a spinoff will enhance shareholder value and allow management to concentrate on its core non - conforming mortgage banking business .

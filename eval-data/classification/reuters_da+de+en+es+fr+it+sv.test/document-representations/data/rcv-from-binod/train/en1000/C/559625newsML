SES asks Cam response to auditors report . The Stock Exchange of Singapore ( SES ) said on Monday it had asked electronics contract manufacturer CAM International Holdings Ltd ( Cam ) to respond to allegations in a report by auditors Ernst & Young . The report , released on Monday by the SES , said it found possible companies act and penal code violations on the part of certain Cam directors . Cam officials could not be reached immediately for comment . The SES said in a statement that the matters referred to in the report " are of a serious nature and could have a material adverse impact on the company " . Therefore , it said , " the exchange is of the view that it is in the interest of the shareholders that this report be made known to the shareholders immediately . " Ernst & Young originally delivered the report to the Ministry of Finance on April 29 . A copy was forwarded to the SES , which released it . " The Exchange has written to the company for its explanation on the allegations made in the report against some of the company ' s directors , " the SES said . Ernst & Young had told the Finance Ministry they had " reason to believe that a serious offence . . . of the Companies Act has been or is likely to have been committed " by an officer or officers of Cam in respect of its transactions with two subsidiaries . Over the weekend Cam , whose shares have been suspended since April 30 , had said its board of directors was not aware of any fraud against the company . It said in a statement that Ernst & Young had told Cam of the report , but had not given Cam a copy . But , Cam said , it " can only surmise that the report has been made under Section 207 ( 9A ) of the Companies Act " . That requires the auditors of a public company to tell the Finance Minister if they have reason to believe " a serious offence involving fraud or other dishonesty is being or has been committed against the company by officers or employees of the company . " CAM said in the weekend statement it was not aware of any fraud and would make an announcement if and when it received further information on the report . It said the company was working with the auditors to complete the audit of its financial statement for the year ended September 30 , 1996 . The company said it was in the process of responding to Ernst & Young ' s queries on three main items . They were Singapore $ 23 . 94 million owed by trade debtors , an advance payment of S $ 1 . 9 million for the purchase of fixed assets and the quantification of unrealised profits from intra - group sales . CAM said it was hopeful that once Ernst & Young received the company ' s clarifications on these items , the auditors would be able to complete the audit by May 9 , 1997 . - - Singapore Newsroom 65 - 8703080

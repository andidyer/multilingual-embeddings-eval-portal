Although the Easter public holidays reduced processsing levels , Australian cattle prices were supported by lower yardings and an improvement in both the U . S . and , to a lesser extent , the Japanese market . After rising substantially , the U . S . market eased over the past seven days to relinquish most of the gains made before Easter . Last week lean beef prices in the U . S . rose four to eight cents a pound , driven largely by spot buying by a small number of large end users . Again the increased use of fed cattle chucks by the grinding segment eventually moderated demand for other lean beef items and contributed to the forfeiting of price rises . Over the past fortnight , three - way chuck prices have fallen seven US cents a lb to 81 US cents a lb , the lowest price since July last year , increasing their attractiveness to grinders . The substitution of chucks for other lean beef items in grinding mixes may gain momentum as supplies of market ready cattle in U . S . feedlots are forecast to increase substantially from the end of April . Currently there are around eight percent more cattle on feed in the U . S . than at this time last year . Record large placements in the last seven months of 1996 , combined with huge in - movement so far in 1997 , has created massive feedlot supplies . Supplies of marketable cattle more than 120 days on feed during April now exceed year earlier levels for the first time since May 1996 . Compared with the five - year average to 1996 , supplies of market ready cattle are forecast to be 7 . 2 percent higher in April , up 10 . 7 percent in May , up 18 . 4 percent in June and up 28 . 6 percent in July . A likely fallout from larger U . S . fed cattle supplies will be increased competition in the Japanese market . As U . S . production levels have drifted lower since the beginning of this year , U . S . exporters have to some extent withdrawn from the Japanese market . This has seen Australia recapture its position as market share leader . In January and February , Australia held 48 percent and 53 percent respectively of the Japanese imported beef market while the U . S . held 45 percent and 41 percent . However , as fed beef production levels rise in the U . S . over the next few months , Australia will come under increased pressure in maintaining its share of this market . Although tariffs into Japan were lowered on April 1 , for chilled beef to 44 . 3 percent from 46 . 2 percent and frozen to 44 . 3 percent from 50 percent , the effect has been overshadowed by strong demand from the U . S . manufacturing beef market . Japanese traders have lifted offer prices for both chilled and frozen product in order to attract supplies which are being diverted to the U . S . manufacturing beef market . Over the past fortnight , export offer prices from Japan for the majority of chilled and frozen items have increased two to five U . S . cents , the main exception being loin cuts . The effect of the stronger U . S . manufacturing market is evident in Australia ' s March shipment figures . In March Auystralia shipped 22 , 049 tonnes of beef to the U . S . , an increase of 7 , 600 tonnes on February and 5 , 700 tonnes on March 1996 . In contrast , shipments to Japan were only 23 , 812 tonnes in March , down 3 , 100 tonnes compared with February and 4 , 300 tonnes compared with March 1996 . An apparent further curbing of imports by Japan over the last month would imply that , unless consumption in Japan has slowed accordingly , Japanese traders drew down stock levels appreciably during March . Lower Japanese stock levels leading to the Golden Week holiday in May should soon begin to impact on buying strategies in Japan . Overall , fed beef production in the U . S . is expected to increase over the next few months , implying lower U . S . fed cattle prices . This will increase the use of fed cattle cuts in grinding mixes , which will to some extent offset tight lean beef supply and cap rises in lean beef prices . Increased use of fed cattle cuts in U . S . grinding mixes may limit the magnitude of the increase in U . S . fed beef exports to Japan . Markets should also receive some support from demand in both Japan and the U . S . , which is expected to rise seasonally in coming months . Throughout the second half of 1997 tighter supplies of feeder steers are forecast to lead to a decline in U . S . feedlot placements , leading ultimately to smaller numbers of cattle on feed and lower fed beef production in late 1997 . The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan , which has halted Taiwanese pork exports , will likely add further pressure to an already tight world pork supply situation . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

RTRS - New Australia reinsurer targets niche insurer . Australia ' s newest reinsurance company , New Cap Reinsurance Cap Holdings Ltd ( New Re Cap ) , on Thursday unveiled a strategy to provide capped reinsurance to specialty insurers around the world . New Cap Re categorised the key component of its underwriting strategy as capped risk reinsurance and said the methodology it was using had been tested over a 10 - year period . " The results of that experience have been actuarially analysed to have generated a 15 point underwriting profit over the last five years . This in an industry that is routinely accustomised to an underwriting loss , " the company ' s deputy managing director , Paul Williams , told a media briefing . In October , New Cap Re raised US $ 150 million by way of a global private placement . The Bermuda - domiciled company , headed by managing director Iain Thompson , aims to raise another A $ 10 . 1 million through the public issue in Australia of four million shares at A $ 2 . 53 each . The offer has been fully underwritten by investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell ( formerly Bain and Co ) and the company expects to list on the Australian Stock Exchange on December 12 . " The business that we are involved with is negotiated contracts as opposed to commoditised contracts . In general we would be dealing with specialty insurers who are themselves driven by the need to produce underwriting profits , " Williams said . Williams said New Cap Re ' s business would not be affected by reinsurance rates . " We are split in terms of our experience away from reinsurance companies , " he said . " As the market becomes more commoditised , the more there is a need for a non - standard product - The more the industry standardises , the more business there is for us , " he said . Europe was seen as an emerging market for New Re Cap as that market moved towards the commoditisation of reinsurance in contrast to the U . S . market was already well commoditised . Williams said the company ' s policy of writing business in a capped manner limited its downside and allowed it to reduce the volatility in relation to exposures . New Cap Re has pre - negotiated the underwriting of in excess of A $ 100 million or premium income through well - established clients of its chief underwriter , Volker de Chelard . " This has allowed us to hit the ground running in terms of negotiated contracts to begin with , " Williams said . The company ' s prospectus forecasts A $ 225 million of gross written premium in the year to June 30 , 1997 , growing to A $ 600 million by 2001 . Operating profit was forecast to grow from A $ 20 million to A $ 106 million over the same period . New Cap Re expects that less than five percent of its premium income would be generated from Australian exposures . Williams said the company ' s Sydney base gave it a significant advantage over other international reinsurers , especially those in the Unites States , as there was 10 to 15 point expense ratio advantage . " We also have the advantage over other operating insurance company investments in that the company has no latent liability , no historic exposure to environmental liabilities like asbestos , " Williams said . Williams said the company was entering the Australian market at a time when the market was hungry for new capacity . The Australian reinsurance industry has grown from nil income in 1986 to A $ 1 . 25 billion in 1995 . This is projected to grow to A $ 2 billion by 2000 , Williams said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

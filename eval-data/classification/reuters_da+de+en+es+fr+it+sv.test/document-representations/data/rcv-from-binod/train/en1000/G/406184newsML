Austria unveils plans to cut immigration . Austria on Thursday unveiled a package aimed at tightening immigration laws and giving preference to Austrians in the job market . The coalition government of Social Democrats and the conservative People ' s Party faces growing public concern over mounting unemployment . In January , unemployment hit a post - World War Two record of 4 . 1 percent at 300 , 000 people . From now on no new immigrants would be allowed into Austria except those with key skills that are not available in the country , Interior Minister Karl Schloegl told a news conference . Foreign families would only be allowed to join relatives who had been living in Austria for a long time , he added , without specifying how long . " Some 60 , 000 foreigners who live here legally but have no job permits will get access step by step to the job market . But foreigners will only be employed when no Austrians can be found to fill the vacancies , " said Schloegl . Far - right Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider , who has pressed for years for curbs on immigration , described the proposals as " misleading packaging " . Haider demands an immediate halt to all immigration and the forced repatriation of unemployed foreigners who have lived in the country for less than three years . State benefit to jobless foreigners costs Austria 780 million schillings ( $ 65 million ) annually , he claims . Haider told a news conference on Thursday that foreigners should be sent home with the help of state loans which they would then have to repay .

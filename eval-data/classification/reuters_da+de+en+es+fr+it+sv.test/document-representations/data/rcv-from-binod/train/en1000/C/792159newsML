Berlin radio station to become more regional . Berlin - based radio station RS2 said on Monday it hoped to repeat the success U . S . and British radio stations had seen with a heavier regional focus by starting three separate broadcasts for a neighbouring state . The station will begin offering morning shows this month for the Cottbus , Frankfurt an der Oder and Schwedt regions in the state of Brandenburg , in addition to continuing its Berlin - based show , general manager Ulrich Gathmann said . " We want to better serve our Berlin listeners and present a respectable offer to the Brandenburg region , " Gathmann told reporters , adding that the station hoped to boost its audience by 20 , 000 to 90 , 000 listeners . The three new frequencies will offer news with a heavy local focus for each of the regions , which Brandenburg programming director Rik DeLisle said was particularly important for listeners in the early morning . " We had been doing afternoon regional programming for about a year and a half and the ratings went through the roof , " DeLisle said . " Then we thought , people need to have that information first thing in the morning . " DeLisle , a former disc jockey from the U . S . , added that the expansion of highly regionalised radio programming at home and in Britain led him to encourage the new approach at RS2 . " Radio as people know it in England and in the U . S . has a station for every little town , " DeLisle said . " Germany hasn ' t gotten that far yet . We are the first in the country to offer separate regional morning shows . " DeLisle said the station would spend 1 . 5 million marks on the local shows and planned to earn that back in advertising revenues next year .

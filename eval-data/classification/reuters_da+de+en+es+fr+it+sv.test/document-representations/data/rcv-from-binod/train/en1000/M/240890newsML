Durch overnight rates continue Thursday ' s rise . Most Dutch money market rates seemed unaffected by the bond market ' s slide on Friday , remaining stable in disorderly pre - weekend trade . Only call money was significantly up , quoting 2 . 81 to 2 . 94 , while most deals were done at 2 . 87 , some 20 basis points higher than on Thursday . " I don ' t think the rise ( in call money ) is due to a tight allocation , although some players may have subscribed for a too small amount and may now be pushing the call up , " one dealer said . He said the main part of the rise was probably due to the pre - weekend effect , referring to the usual rise in overnight guilders ahead of the weekend . This morning , the central bank allocated 7 . 455 billion guilders to the money market under a seven - day special advances pact at an unchanged rate of 2 . 50 percent . The pact replaced an eight - day facility of 6 . 47 billion guilders which expired today . The flurry on the surrounding bond markets did not seem to have a significant effect on Dutch money market rates . " Clearly , a lot of money is going out of bonds , especially from investment funds , but I don ' t see it flowing into the money market at the moment , " one dealer said . As bond deals are settled three working days after they are done , he said he did not expect a big impact from this pullout of bonds on the money market before next week . " If it is going towards the money market at all , " he said . One - year deposits were quoted 3 . 20 / 28 , up from 3 . 16 / 24 yesterday . Trade was concentrated on overnight money and one - month deposits , dealers said . The guilder held steady against the mark , quoting 112 . 17 per 100 marks , as it did on Thursday . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

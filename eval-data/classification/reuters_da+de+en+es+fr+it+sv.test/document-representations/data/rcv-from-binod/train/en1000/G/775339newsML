Flood row unlikely to sway Polish election - poll . Most Poles give their government poor reviews for its handling of the past month ' s floods but this is unlikely to have a big impact on September 21 general elections , according to an opinion poll published on Monday . " The general assessment of the central authorities during the floods was unfavourable for them , " Gazeta Wyborcza daily reported on a survey by the CBOS institute . It said 43 percent of those not directly affected by the disaster considered central authorities had performed poorly or very badly , about 25 percent felt their performance had been middling , and 26 percent rated it adequate or good . It said that those directly affected were more critical of central government , while being more favourable towards local authorities , but there were so few flood victims in the survey that any broad statistical conclusions were difficult . The opposition has repeatedly attacked the government over its response to the floods , which began in early July . The ruling Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) of Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz has rejected charges of delay and inefficiency in organising rescue and relief , saying the sheer scale of the disaster was totally unexpected . The opposition also called for the government to declare a state of emergency , which would have automatically delayed the elections , arguing that voting would be impractical in the areas ravaged by the floods . The ruling party refused . The public CBOS institute ' s survey , conducted in the final week of July among a random sample of 1 , 118 people around the country , showed that political sympathies were the main influence when assessing the government ' s flood performance . Most blame for the extent of the disaster was placed on factors such as the poor state of dikes and the heaviness of the downpours in early July , Gazeta Wyborcza said . Only a minority cited factors such as lack of preparation , equipment or bad organisation . In this context , 11 percent blamed local government and 17 percent the central government . " It is therefore doubtful whether the flood will fundamentally affect electoral preferences , " the paper said . The ex - communist SLD has been in power in an uneasy coalition with a smaller Peasant Party since September 1993 . It faces its main election challenge from an alliance of rightist parties grouped around the Solidarity trade union . On Monday the flood waters in Poland , which killed 54 people and caused billions of dollars in damage , were still slowly receding but some 180 , 000 hectares ( 450 , 000 acres )

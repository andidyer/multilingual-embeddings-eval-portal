India ' s Sundram sees 1997 / 98 exports up . Indian automobile component firm Sundram Fasteners Ltd said on Wednesday it expects higher exports in 1997 / 98 ( April - March ) despite the rupee ruling firm against the dollar . " Exports should be better this year , " company chairman Suresh Krishna told Reuters by telephone from the firm ' s headquarters in the southern city of Madras .

Jagannathan , the company ' s president ( finance ) said exports are expected to grow 30 to 40 percent in 1997 / 98 . Indian export growth has been slowing down this year .

The rupee has been stagnant at 35 . 75 / 85 against the dollar since mid - 1996 despite the dollar ' s rise against global currencies .

The rupee has stayed firm on the back of large capital inflows from foreign direct and portfolio investment .

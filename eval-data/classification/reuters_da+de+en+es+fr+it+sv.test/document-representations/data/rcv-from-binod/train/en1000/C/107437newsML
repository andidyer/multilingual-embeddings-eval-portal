Texas Instruments sees further volatility . Texas Instruments Inc Chairman Jim Adams said he was encouraged by the lastest book - to - bill report for semiconductors but warned that the chip market would remain volatile . " We look for good signs like others do , but I don ' t think we can see one change in our book - to - bill ratio and forecast that into the future . We have to wait and see and watch , " Adams told Reuters . The Semiconductor Industry Association earlier this week said its closely watched book - to - bill ratio of orders to sales rose to 0 . 99 in September from 0 . 93 in August . The ratio means semiconductor manufacturers last month received $ 99 in new orders for ever $ 100 in chips they sold . Adams said there were signs of encouragement in the market for Texas Instruments ' core product of DRAMs ( dynamic random access memory chips ) though the market was not yet stable . " Basically , there is volatility ahead . . . . We are going to be on the lookout for volatility , " he said . Adams said Texas Instruments continues to do well in its differentiated products businesses , such as digital signal processes . - - New York Newsdesk 212 - 859 - 1610

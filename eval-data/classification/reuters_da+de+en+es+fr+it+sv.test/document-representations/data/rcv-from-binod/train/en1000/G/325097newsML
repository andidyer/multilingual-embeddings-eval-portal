French police hold rightists over letter bomb . French police detained a dozen suspected right - wing extremists on Wednesday in a probe into a letter bomb mailed to a Jewish newspaper , the Interior Ministry said . It said police acting on orders from France ' s chief anti - terrorism investigator , Judge Jean - Louis Bruguiere , found guns and documents in several Paris homes with " a racist and anti - Semitic connotation , including works about sabotage acts and the making of explosive devices " . Last month the editor of the weekly Tribune Juive ( Jewish Forum ) received a booby - trapped videocassette which failed to go off . An unsigned statement claimed responsibility for the attack " in solidarity with the fate of our Palestinian brothers , particularly in Hebron " . Israel and the Palestinian Authority last week signed a long - awaited deal on a partial pull - out of Israeli forces from the West Bank town . The suspected rightists detained on Wednesday had recently stuck up anti - Semitic posters and had been under police surveillance , the ministry said .

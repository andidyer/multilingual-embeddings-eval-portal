Hong Kong stocks edge to firmer close , volume thin . Hong Kong stocks edged to a firmer close on Monday as investors covered short positions following a selloff last week but amid thin volume as caution remained over the outlook for Wall Street and interest rates . The Hang Seng Index closed on a gain of 83 . 25 points , or 0 . 68 percent , at 12 , 287 . 84 . Turnover was HK $ 5 . 05 billion compared with HK $ 4 . 91 billion on Friday . " It ' s reached that point where it ' s better for investors to stop playing the game , " said Kent Rossiter , institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities , pointing to the low turnover figures as evidence of the market ' s apathy . Rossiter said the market was becalmed by lack of news to provide direction for investors . Last month had seen market - moving information , but there was nothing now to focus on until May ' s U . S . Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting in May , he saidOSK Asia Securities dealing director Andrew To said Monday ' s rally had been largely technical , helped by short - covering in HSBC Holdings Plc and blue chip property developers . If Wall Street fell this week , the Hang Seng Index might test psychological support at 12 , 000 points , To said , adding that evidence of stability could prompt a rebound to 12 , 600 . Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Green said last month ' s rise in the key U . S . federal funds rate had sparked investor fears of a round of rate rises identical to the last . " The ordeal of the previous ( U . S . ) interest rate increase cycle is still so indelible in people ' s minds , " Green said . But Green said the U . S . economic fundamentals which prompted a round of rate rises from February 1994 were different from U . S . fundamentals in 1997 . The Hang Seng Index had been up more than 150 points at one point in the morning session , largely on the back of a rise in U . S . stocks , but pared its gains in the afternoon .

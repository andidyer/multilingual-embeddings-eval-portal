IOC buys 90 , 000 tonnes of diesel for September . State - owned Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) bought by tender only 90 , 000 tonnes of high - speed diesel in two cargoes for September delivery , much lower than earlier expected , traders said on Monday . The two 45 , 000 tonne cargoes are for delivery to Madras or Haldia on the Indian east coast at a premium of 47 cents per barrel to Singapore spot quotes , on a cost and freight basis , traders said . The sellers were Shell Singapore and Cargill . Traders had expected India to buy small volumes this time , but the least was 200 , 000 tonnes . " This is a low volume time of the year , " one trader said . " But the fact that India took the much lower volume is surprising . I think they are trying to talk down the market in anticipation of some term talks . " IOC took 165 , 000 tonnes of diesel in August . - - Singapore newsroom 65 - 8703080

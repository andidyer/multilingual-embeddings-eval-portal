S . Africa approves electricity restructure plans . South African Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna said on Friday the cabinet had approved proposals for the long - awaited restructuring of the country ' s electricity supply industry . Maduna said in a statement that government ' s plans had the support of major industry players , who understood and accepted the need for electricity transformation . But the National Union of Mine Workers ( NUM ) on Friday rejected the recommendations , saying they represented only the views of employers in the industry and that the process of canvassing views had been " secretive " . " We call on the minIster . . . to facilitate a public debate on the secret process that was followed . . . The announcement does not reflect the divesity of views , " the NUM said in a statement . Proposals by the Electricity Restructuring Interdepartmental Committee include : - the consolidation of the electricity distribution industry into the maximum number of financially viable and semi - independent regional electricity distributers ; - the introduction of cost - reflective and transparent tariffs , an electrificiation levy and a capped tax which would partly be used to fund municipal services ; - that the levy on electricity sales be paid into an electrification fund to be admistered at a national level ; - consultation by the ministers of minerals and energy affairs , finance , public enterprises and provincial affairs with major industry stakeholders , and - the appointment of a full - time restructuring team , in conjunction with major shareholders , in planning the transformation process . Maduna said that government ' s transformation plans had the support of the major players in the industry . He said the next step would be for government to consult with a number of key industry players including leaders in provincial government , organised labour , electicity utility Eskom and business . " They will form part of the process that will shape the future of an effective and efficient electricity supply industry in South Africa , " Maduna said . - - Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

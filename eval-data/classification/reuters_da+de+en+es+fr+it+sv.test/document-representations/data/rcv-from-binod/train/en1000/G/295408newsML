ALPINE SKIING - WOMEN ' S DOWNHILL TRAINING DELAYED . The first of two women ' s World Cup downhill training runs scheduled on Thursday was delayed by two hours because of unforseen safety problems , organisers said on Thursday . According to organisers , more work had to be done on the Strohsack piste in order to provide the maximum safety for ski racers . The first practice run , originally scheduled for 0915 GMT , would now begin at 1100 GMT . Organisers were uncertain whether a second training run would be possible on Thursday . A warm weather front which softened the slope , led to the cancellation of a practice run in Bad Kleinkirchheim on Wednesday . International Ski Federation officials and local organisers spent all day on Wednesday mending the slope with a chemical used to harden snow . Bad Kleinkirchheim is due to host two downhills and a super - giant slalom from Friday to Sunday . The first downhill is the replacement for a race postponed in Crans Montana in December .

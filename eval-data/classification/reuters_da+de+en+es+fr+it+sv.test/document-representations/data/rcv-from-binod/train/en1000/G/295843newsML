Peru ' s Fujimori seeks to revive hostage talks . President Alberto Fujimori launched a publicity offensive against Marxist rebels holding 74 hostages in the Japanese ambassador ' s residence here and sought to resume talks to end the 23 - day - old crisis . Fujimori ' s energetic style , in stark contrast to a low - profile approach in the first three weeks of the crisis , led to speculation on Thursday that negotiations and hostage releases , which ground to a halt last week , would resume . A relaxed and joking Fujimori led an election - style tour of Lima ' s poor neighbourhoods on Wednesday , lambasting the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) guerrillas as " terrorists " and promising to bring a peaceful end to the crisis . Talks between the government and the rebels stopped abruptly after a first face - to - face meeting 12 days ago , but Fujimori said he was eager to see negotiations revived . " I would say we are looking for more favourable conditions allowing this contact to happen , " he told Atlanta - based Cable News Network in an interview . Fujimori blamed the stalled negotiations on an impromptu news conference given by guerrillas inside the residence on New Year ' s Eve . The president said a " commission of guarantors " could be formed to oversee a peaceful end to the crisis but gave few clues to his strategy to secure the release of the hostages . He repeated he would not grant the rebels ' main demand , that he pardon about 400 jailed colleagues , and said if any of the hostages were hurt the government would consider ending the siege with force . There was no immediate response from the 20 - odd MRTA guerrillas who seized the diplomatic residence in a carefully - planned assault on Dec 17 , bursting in on an exclusive cocktail party and taking more than 500 guests hostage . A slow but steady trickle of hostage releases dried up on Jan . 1 and the rebels held top government and security force officials , about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats and the brother of Fujimori on Thursday . Fujimori resumed his traditional tours of Lima shantytowns in recent days in a clear effort to seize the propaganda initiative from the MRTA which has used tools from crude signs to the Internet to positive effect throughout the siege . " This is a great demonstration . . . in favour of the government , in favour of peace , and against violence , " said Fujimori , clad in jeans and a white casual shirt . His strong attacks on the rebels were met by cries of : " We are with you " from the crowds who came out to greet him . A group of about 70 residents from the neighbourhood later held a candlelit vigil outside the residence calling for the hostages ' release . " People don ' t want violence , they want peace . We have come to the residence because we want freedom for the hostages , " said Enrique Pena , organiser of the demonstration . Fujimori ' s largely successful war against Peru ' s two main guerrilla groups has brought him popular support in recent years . Local radio reported on Thursday that an MRTA " military leader " captured on Tuesday in the central jungle had told anti - terrorist police that four MRTA commando units were still operating in the area . The CPN radio station said Carlos Dario Perez had given the DINCOTE police the names of four other guerrilla leaders at large in the Chanchamayo Valley , 220 miles ( 350 km ) east of Lima . The report could not be immediately confirmed . In Lima , local and foreign journalists called for the immediate release of a reporter and a translator from Japan ' s TV Asahi arrested on Tuesday after sneaking past police for a two - hour meeting with the MRTA inside the diplomatic mansion . " We are waiting for the government to explain on what legal basis they are being held , " said Sally Bowen , president of Peru ' s Foreign Press Association .

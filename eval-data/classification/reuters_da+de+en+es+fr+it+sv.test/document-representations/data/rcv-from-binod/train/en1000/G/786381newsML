Australian athletes fall ill after bridge collapse . At least 10 Australian athletes have fallen ill in the wake of the Maccabiah Games bridge collapse in Israel - - one due to lung damage caused by poisons in the Yakron River . Three Australians were killed in the accident . Vice - President of Maccabi Australia Tom Danos said on Thursday he knew of at least 10 athletes who had suffered respiratory problems after either falling or diving into the river after the bridge near Tel Aviv collapsed on July 14 . " At least 10 athletes have reported respiratory problems since they ' ve come home and all of them were in the water at some time or another , " Danos told Reuters . " Some of these people had been saved from drowning after being resuscitated at the scene while others had dived into the water to try and save others , " Danos said . " We can ' t be sure of how this has happened until we get the report back from the ( Israeli ) government authorities but it ' s our strong belief that it ' s arisen from the water . " Two Australian team members died and dozens more were injured when the footbridge collapsed underneath them as they were marching towards the main stadium for the opening ceremony of the Jewish Olympics . A third Australian died 12 days later in hospital due to lung damage caused by poisonous water , Israeli doctors said . Danos said he believed the recent health problems were caused by the Yakron ' s polluted waters and that he had asked the Israeli government for an official analysis of the water . He said some of the sick had recovered soon after the incident but had begun to show additional symptoms since returning to Australia . Danos said one team member , 29 - year - old rugby player Adam Sumegi , had spent nine days in intensive care and had lost 12 kgs ( 26 pounds ) after diving into the water to rescue teammates trapped under the fallen bridge . " I ' ve barely eaten since the day of the bridge , " Sumegi told The Australian newspaper on Thursday . " My stomach got infected and caused my oesophagus to ulcerate . I have been pretty ill . " Danos said Maccabi Australia President Tom Goldman had returned to Israel this week to resolve compensation issues and seek further information from the government on the water . An Israeli inquiry into the bridge collapse has found that faulty design , materials and construction led to the disaster .

The operating profit was above analysts ' predictions which averaged 1 . 44 billion marks , up 8 . 4 percent . The increase was expected to be relatively modest because Commerzbank ' s risk provisions were relatively light in the first half of 1996 , followed by a sharp rise in the latter half . That means that year - on - year , risk provisions for the first half of 1997 were expected to have risen strongly , thereby squeezing earnings . Commerzbank said that while its group net income from financial transactions declined , its own - account trading profit calculated under International Accounting Standards rose to 534 million marks from 497 million if including the creation of hidden reserves in its securities trading portfolio as well as including interest income relating to own - account trading deals . Commerzbank also said the first - half results gave scope for a dividend rise and for a significant strengthening of its equity capital base provided that business continues to develop positively . - - Frankfurt Newsroom , + 49 69 756525

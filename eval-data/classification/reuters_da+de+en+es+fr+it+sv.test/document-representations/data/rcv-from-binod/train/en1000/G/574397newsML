NBA BASKETBALL - MALONE ATONES AS JAZZ WIN , BULLS MAKE UP FOR LOSS TO HAWKS . Redemption was the word for the day in the NBA playoffs Saturday as Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz atoned for an atrocious showing the last time out and the Chicago Bulls made up for a shocking loss to the Atlanta Hawks . Malone scored 42 points and set a playoff free - throw record as the Jazz moved within one win of a return trip to the Western Conference finals with a convincing 110 - 95 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers . In Atlanta , Toni Kukoc scored eight of his 16 points in a fourth - quarter run as the defending champion Bulls regained the homecourt advantage with a 100 - 80 road rout of the Hawks in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals . Malone was was 18 - of - 18 from the line , breaking the mark for most foul shots made without a miss of 17 , shared by Gail Goodrich , Bob Love and Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller . Utah took a 3 - 1 lead in the best - of - seven conference semifinals . The Jazz can wrap up the series Monday with a win at home , where they are 42 - 3 this season . " This game is over now , " said Malone , who shot just 2 - of - 20 from the field in scoring 15 points in Game 3 . " The most important game is Monday night and our most important thing is not to let down , because they ' re coming in ready to play . " " I think we were embarrassed with the way we played Thursday and with the way we shot , " said Jazz coach Jerry Sloan , whose team lost by 20 points in the previous game . " Karl had a bad game and he ' ll be the first to admit it . But you can always come back the next day . " " I missed some shots early , but I wasn ' t going to hand them my head , " Malone said . " I was just going to keep it going and see what happened . Then I caught fire , like you always look to . Even the other night , the shots felt good . I just missed them all . " He fell two points shy of his playoff high and is averaging 29 points per game in the postseason . Bryon Russell added a playoff career - high 29 points for Utah . " That had to be the best game I ever played , " said Russell , who shot 12 - of - 20 from the field . Shaquille O ' Neal had 34 points , 11 rebounds and six blocks for the Lakers , who trailed by as many as 18 points and lost for the first time in four home playoff games . " The obvious factor in the game was that they came out with more energy and aggressiveness like we did in Game 3 , " Lakers coach Del Harris said . " Across the board , we did not play with the kind of intensity we needed for what could have been the biggest game of the year . " The defending champion Bulls bounced back from their home loss Thursday with their best performace of the playoffs . After erasing an early 10 - point deficit , they held the Hawks to 28 points in the second half and took a 2 - 1 series lead . Game 4 is Sunday in Atlanta . Michael Jordan scored 21 points and Scottie Pippen added 17 for Chicago , but neither was a major factor in the decisive 19 - 4 burst . Jordan and Pippen had carried the offensive load in the Bulls ' first five playoff games , combining for over 55 points per contest . " It was a game that we ' ve been waiting for in the sense that we we busted out of a little slump to some degree , " Jordan said . " The first thing you want to do when you lose on your homecourt is to get it back , " Pippen said . " We want to put them back on their heels but not let them do it to us . Our defence did not allow them to get open looks . We hustled , we beat them to the loose balls . " League rebound leader Dennis Rodman again was a non - factor . He came off the bench and received two personal fouls in his first two minutes . He also was whistled for his eighth technical foul of the playoffs . " They said I was trying to intentionally hurt a player , " Rodman said . " If you really want to single me out , at least give me a memo before the game and don ' t do it in front of millions of people . " Late - season addition Brian Williams scored 10 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter as the Bulls pulled away . " We didn ' t rely on one or two people to do all the work , " Jordan said . " Brian came in and ignited our offence . " Dikembe Mutombo had 16 points , 13 rebounds and four blocks for the Hawks , who matched the second - worst second half in playoff history with their 28 points . " I think we surrendered in the second half , " Mutombo said . " I can ' t believe we didn ' t take one step ahead today when we were given the chance that we were givem . We need to give the extra effort out there and today we just quit . " Mookie Blaylock , who confounded the Bulls with 57 points , 19 rebounds and 14 assists in the first two games , was held to 10 points on 3 - of - 10 shooting .

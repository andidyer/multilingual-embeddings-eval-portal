Dlr closes weaker in US after active cross session . The dollar pared early gains , closing lower after mark crosses staged a mid - morning comeback and traders squared up before Monday ' s U . S . Labor Day holiday . After a brief foray to 1 . 4844 marks , the dollar did an about - face when early selling of marks sputtered , and the German currency rebounded against the yen and in Europe . " The mark has been king all month , " said Stephen Flanagan , vice president at Credit Agricole . " And we ' ve seen good profit - taking in mark crosses ( earlier Friday ) . " But since the mark has bounced back , obviously dollar / mark has come off as well . It ' s a cross - driven market . " The dollar closed at 1 . 4790 / 95 marks and at 108 . 70 / 80 yen , off from 1 . 4830 / 40 marks and 108 . 72 / 82 yen at the open . Remarks on Friday by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer , who said U . S . fundamentals should allow a stronger dollar , fueled the dollar ' s early surge through stop - buy orders near 1 . 4820 marks . His comments may also have been interpreted as a signal of official disquiet over recent mark strength . After a brief bout of mark lightening , rebounding crosses dovetailed with a sharp decline in U . S . bond and stock markets to erode dollar support following robust U . S . economic data . The markets were focusing on the 1000 EDT / 1400 GMT release of the Chicagoland Business Barometer , which surged to a seasonally adjusted 60 . 0 in August from 51 . 2 in July , far surpassing expectations of 51 . 9 . The 30 - year U . S . Treasury bond fell more than a point amid rekindled expectations the Federal Reserve would deem higher rates necessary to crimp a rapid economic expansion . Even a weaker Chicago prices paid component , which fell to 51 . 8 from 53 . 0 in July , failed to stem the bond ' s slide . The Dow Jones Industrial stock average also was off nearly 60 points , shortly after the index was released . " The crosses were moving then that news came out , " said Bill Nevius , vice president at Natwest Markets . " Dollar / mark had gone ( up ) through 1 . 4820 on a stop - run ; then if you needed a reason to sell you had it with bonds and the Dow . " Factory orders also surged 1 . 8 percent in July amid economists expectations of a 1 . 0 percent rise . But the dollar ignored July personal income and spending increases , which were near expections at up 0 . 1 percent and up 0 . 2 percent respectively . Dealers said the most active pairing was mark / yen , with yen weakness aiding dollar / yen as the cross surged to 73 . 55 . The Chigago IMM ended an abbreviated session at 1200 EDT / 1600 GMT , ahead of the long U . S . weekend . " That will basically shut down the currency and bond markets early , " said Nevius . Mark / Swiss ended at 0 . 8112 / 15 up from 0 . 8102 / 04 earlier and mark / French closed at 3 . 4212 / 15 , up from Friday ' s 3 . 4197 low , but off an early U . S . rate of 3 . 4224 / 28 . In other trade , the dollar fell to 1 . 2005 / 15 Swiss francs from 1 . 2030 / 40 at the open and rose to Canadian $ 1 . 3680 / 85 from C $ 1 . 3665 / 70 . The pound rose to $ 1 . 5602 / 09 from $ 1 . 5552 / 59 . - - Alden Bentley 212 859 1667

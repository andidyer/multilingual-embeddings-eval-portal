Apple shares rise on takeover speculation . Apple Computer Inc shares rose as much as 6 . 3 percent Thursday on renewed speculation that the troubled computer maker is trying to sell itself to a bigger company . Shares of the Cupertino , Calif . , company were up 7 / 8 at 18 - 7 / 8 in mid - afternoon trading of 4 . 26 million shares , making the stock the eighth - most active on the Nasdaq . Earlier , the shares traded as high as 19 - 1 / 8 . On Wednesday , Saudi billionaire prince al - Waleed bin Talal revealed he bought a five percent stake in Apple for $ 115 million because he expects the company to turn itself around . Last week , software billionaire Larry Ellison , chairman of Oracle Corp , said he intended to form an investor group to try to buy a majority stake in Apple , take control of the company and revamp it with a new management team . The New York Times , citing unnamed Apple sources , also reported Thursday that Apple is actively seeking to sell itself and has approached Sun Microsystems Inc again . Sun tried to buy Apple in late 1995 , but negotiations fell apart over price . An Apple spokeswomen declined to comment about the speculation . Scott McNealy , Sun chief executive , also declined to comment about the rumors , " no matter how accurate or silly they may be . " Mulling takeover bids is nothing new at Apple . In addition to Sun , Apple has negotiated with International Business Machines Corp in recent years . A former high - level Apple executive who keeps close contact with the company said he has not heard of any recent moves by Apple to approach suitors , but increasing pressure from investors - - who hold stock near a 10 - year low - - may make Chairman Gilbert Amelio more receptive to any takeover proposal that might come along . Trouble is , none might come along , analysts said . " It ' s always possible , but we ' re not putting a lot of weight into it , " said Peter Andrews , analyst at brokerage AG Edwards & Sons Inc in St . Louis . Even though Apple still has a huge following of Macintosh users , the company will not be able to stop its sales from falling for at least another year , making it an unattractive buyout , analysts said . In the past five quarters Apple has reported financial losses of close to $ 1 billion and has had two rounds of job cuts totalling 5 , 400 . Despite the massive expense reductions , the company does not expect to report a profit until the September quarter . Company executives have told investors they expect revenue for the year to fall about 20 percent to $ 8 billion .

Pakistan PM wants early Kashmir talks with India . Pakistan ' s new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Sunday his government wanted early talks with neighbouring India to settle the long - standing dispute between the two nations over Kashmir region . But in his first televised address to the nation since taking office last week , he affirmed Pakistan ' s support for a separatist revolt in the two - thirds of the Himalayan region ruled by India . Pakistan controls the remaining third of Kashmir , over which the two countries have fought two of their three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947 . " And God - willing , our government will intensify the campaign for moral and diplomatic support and to organise world public opinion for the success of the oppressed Kashmiri people ' s freedom struggle , " Sharif said . He said Pakistan wanted good neighbourly and peaceful relations with India for economic development and prosperity in the region and " we wish that the Kashmir dispute is settled through early and peaceful negotiations " . Sharif ' s comment was his first on the issue after Indian Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda said in a letter to him on Monday that New Delhi wanted to resume peace talks on a wide range of issues , including Kashmir . Bilateral talks broke down in January 1994 because of deep differences on Kashmir . New Delhi regards the whole region as an integral part of India . But Islamabad wants the predominantly Moslem Kashmiris to decide in a U . N . - mandated plebiscite whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu - majority India . Some of the militant groups fighting Indian rule want to unite Kashmir into an independent state . New Delhi accuses Islamabad of training and arming Kashmiri militants who started the present revolt in the Delhi - ruled part started in early 1990 . Pakistan denies the charge and says its support for the revolt , in which more than 20 , 000 people have been killed , is only moral and political . Sharif said his government would chart its foreign policy on the principle of " friendship with all and enmity towards none " and regarded a balance of power as inevitable to safeguard peace . For this reason , he said , " we are determined to continue Pakistan ' s peaceful nuclear programme and our struggle against any unilateral and discriminatory restriction on ( our ) nuclear capability " . Both India and Pakistan say their nuclear programmes are peaceful but Western experts believe the two countries can quickly assembly nuclear weapons .

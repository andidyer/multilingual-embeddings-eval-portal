Oil price pressures Santos , Woodside . A sharp slide in the oil price offshore put shares in major oil producers , Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd , under pressure on Monday with both companies ' scrip losing 2 . 5 percent to A $ 9 . 40 and A $ 4 . 71 respectively . On Friday in the U . S . , NYMEX crude continued its sharp decline as the need for refined product diminished amid declining heating oil use and the peak summer demand season for gasoline still too far away . March crude settled off US $ 0 . 87 cents a barrel at US $ 22 . 23 , declining for the fourth consecutive session and losing US $ 1 . 92 a barrel for the week . " They are both major producers and they have been sold down with the commodity ' s price , " said a Sydney - based dealer . Earlier today , the Australian government issued a production licence to Woodside to develop its Laminaria and Corallina oil fields in the Timor Sea and while there were some concerns over the project ' s stated A $ 1 . 08 billion cost , brokers were sceptical of it as a reason for the share price weakness . " I would be doubtful if that was the reason . Oil was off and it didn ' t have a good week , " the Sydney dealer said . Others agreed , adding that Woodside had been possibly been priced at the top end of fair value in any case . " I think Woodside has probably been overpriced for a while anyhow , in terms of what they can expect to earn in the next two years , " said broker Kevin Lourey of Peake Lands Kirwan . Woodside said after the licence ' s announcement that the estimated cost of the project had been revised down to A $ 1 billion , higher than its initial estimate of A $ 900 million but lower than the government ' s A $ 1 . 08 billion figure .

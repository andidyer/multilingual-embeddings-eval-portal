New Zealand to launch unique electricity market . New Zealand ' s new wholesale electricity market geared up for its launch on Monday as players began entering bids and offers in the day - ahead and physical markets . When the market officially opens on Tuesday , the wholesale price of electricity will for the first time be discovered on the basis of supply and demand , as opposed to the cost - based method employed in the past . " Apart from the demand side no longer being passive price takers , the key thing is that we will actually see how prices are formed , and efficient economic signals will emanate from the market which havn ' t been around before , " said Lincoln Gould , chief executive of market operator EMCO ( Electricity Market Company ) . The day - ahead market is purely a financial hedging market through which players can manage their risks and lock in prices for the next day . Their dealings in this market are netted off against their actual transactions in the physical market . The physical spot market is where electricity is traded . The sellers place offers into the market pool on a half - hourly basis . They might offer the capacity of a certain hydro station for a given period at a given price . Power companies then place bids into the pool for the volume of electricity they are prepared to purchase at a particular price . Offers and bids become supply and demand curves on a graph . The point at which the curves intersect becomes the market clearing price - - the price at which a certain amount of electricity is cleared at a given time . There are approximately 200 such graphs for each of the electricity injection and exit points on the national grid . The cheapest source of electricity is thus easily identified , signalling where the next power station should be built . " In the past we had grandiose engineering schemes built for their own sake . Now with this new market , with these efficient price signals coming , we will get shareholders and investors taking risks and not the taxpayer - - those are the big advantages , " said Gould . He expects between 30 , 000 and 33 , 000 gigawatts of electricity to be traded through the market annually , depending on how many bilateral supply contracts are negotiated between generators and power purchasers . " This is , after all , a voluntary market and it is possible for buyers and sellers to establish bilateral physical contracts and bypass the market . " Power companies will have to juggle the risk of the spot market against the more expensive but certain fixed contracts . " This market has been designed so that risks lie where they fall , and it will be those organisations that are best able to manage commercial risk that will survive , " Gould said . Generators are expected to compete with each other in order to get their electricity dispatched , putting downward pressure on prices , and their clients , the electricity retailers , are expected to compete with each other for a share of the deregulated retail market . Gould said the market was unique in being self - regulated , in contrast to government - controlled versions overseas . New Zealand ' s market is only open to physical traders of electricity , but there are plans for a futures contract , opening the possibility of international investor involvement . " That ' s the beauty - - we ' ve now started a market which will open up the opportunity for all sorts of creativity , and I ' m expecting that you will see new products come to the market , you ' ll see all sorts of initiatives that we haven ' t even thought of yet , " Gould said .

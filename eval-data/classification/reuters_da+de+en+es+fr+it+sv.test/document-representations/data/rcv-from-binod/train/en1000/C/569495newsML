Exel to acquire GCR for $ 637 million . Exel Ltd . said Thursday it agreed to acquire the publicly held shares of reinsurer GCR Holdings Ltd . that it does not already own for about $ 637 million , or $ 27 a share in cash . The deal , the latest in the industry , came a day after life insurer Unitrin Inc . said it would buy Reliable Life Insurance Co . . " The entire industry is in the midst of a consolidation , " said Cathy Seifert , an analyst at the S & P Equity Group . " I think if you look at the list of insurance companies out there a year from now , there will be fewer smaller insurance companies . " Exel said it will start a cash tender offer for the 23 . 6 million outstanding GCR shares no later than May 14 . It now owns 1 . 2 million , or 4 . 9 percent , of GCR ' s 24 . 8 million shares outstanding . The offer has been unanimously approved by both companies ' boards directors and is subject to the tender of at least 75 percent of GCR ' s shares . Exel said the merger of the two companies should boost 1997 earnings and increase shareholder value . GCR ' s stock shot up $ 4 . 875 to $ 27 . 25 on Nasdaq . Exel rose $ 3 . 75 to $ 43 . 375 on the New York Stock Exchange , indicating that investors thought the company got a bargain . " I liked what I saw , " said Merrill Lynch analyst Jay Cohen . He upgraded Exel from " accumulate " to " buy " and raised his 12 - month price target for the stock to $ 51 to $ 53 . Analysts expect Exel to make further acquisitions as the deal leaves it with about $ 250 million in excess capital in a rapidly consolidating insurance industry . " After the deal we ' ll still have enough capital to do an acquisition or a buyback , " said EXEL spokesman Gavin Arton . " But it will slow our buyback plan for this year , and we certainly wouldn ' t do a buyback in the next few months . " Arton said Exel would consider a company that provides risk - management products , such as currency risk coverage . But so far , " there ' s nothing we ' ve targeted , " he said . Exel , based in Bermuda , is a leading provider of general liability , directors ' and officers ' liability , employment practices and professional liability , excess property insurance and reinsurance worldwide . GCR , also based in Bermuda , provides property , marine , energy , satellite and financial products reinsurance worldwide through its Global Capital Reinsurance Ltd . subsidiary .

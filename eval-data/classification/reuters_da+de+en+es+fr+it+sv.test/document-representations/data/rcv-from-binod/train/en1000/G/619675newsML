Nigeria pressures Sierra Leone coup leaders . Sierra Leone ' s new military rulers said on Wednesday they were coming under heavy Nigerian pressure to abandon their coup . Captain Paul Thomas , spokesman for the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council , said Nigeria ' s defence minister and army chief of staff were expected in Freetown later in the day to discuss the possibility of restoring elected civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah . The military authorities said the Nigerians had landed 720 troops at Freetown ' s port and airport on Tuesday to reinforce the 900 already stationed in the country under regional cooperation accords . One senior military source said the Nigerians , who were drawn into combat during the coup on Sunday , were demanding to deploy to protect key installations , such as the radio , television and presidential offices . The source said Sierra Leoneans had tried to make the Nigerians at the port disembark with only one rifle and one magazine , but the Nigerians had insisted on landing with all their weapons . New leader Major Johnny Paul Koromah banned political parties and suspended the constitution on Tuesday night , promising to announce a timetable for elections soon .

Symbollon seeks Class B share conversion . Symbollon Corp said on Friday that it was requesting that its stockholders convert their Class B common shares , with five votes each , into an equal number of Class A common shares , with one vote each . The company said it made the request in an effort to eliminate the special voting rights attendant to the Class B shares . Currently , Class B shares represent 77 . 6 percent of the votes eligible to be cast by the company ' s stockholders . If all them were converted , they would represent 40 . 9 percent of the total voting power . The company said that it expected the elimination of the special Class B voting power would make the stock more attractive to the investment community . It said board members who own or control 90 . 7 percent of the Class B stock have indicated their intention to convert their shares . If all of the Class B shares were converted , the voting power of the board would fall to 40 . 2 percent from 71 . 5 percent .

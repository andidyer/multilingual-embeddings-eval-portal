The shares were up 2p at 641p by 0852 GMT , after initially slipping to 628p after the group ' s annual results were announced . Analysts had been eager to hear why second half sales had slipped after the company issued a surprise profit warning in January following disappointing fourth quarter sales . The shares bounced after Argos said like - for - like growth had slowed in the final quarter mainly as a result of weakness in three key markets : toys , electricals and jewellery . The company said its market share had not been affected and first quarter sales were expected to show a recovery . Sales growth in the first 10 weeks of 1997 was up 14 percent and seven percent on a like - for - like basis . Annual pre - tax profits had risen 13 . 7 percent to 141 . 4 million stg , but the company warned that low growth and higher costs in the first half of this year would make it difficult to improve on last year ' s earnings . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4027

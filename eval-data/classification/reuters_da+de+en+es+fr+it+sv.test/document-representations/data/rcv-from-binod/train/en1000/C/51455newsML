Russian PM appoints new privatisation chief . Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has promoted Alfred Kokh , a young economist , to head the State Property Committee , Russia ' s privatisation ministry . A spokesman for the committee said Koch ' s appointment had taken effect on Thursday , filling a post left vacant when Chernomyrdin announced his cabinet last month . Koch , 35 , already first deputy head of the committee , had been acting chairman from August 1995 to January this year . Koch ' s predecessor , Alexander Kazakov , was removed in July to become first deputy head of the presidential administration . Yeltsin ' s chief of staff , Anatoly Chubais , also once headed the property committee . Kokh played a leading role in the controversial shares - for - loans programme promoted by Chubais last year , in which state - owned stakes in major privatised companies were transferred to Russian banks in exchange for loans to the government .

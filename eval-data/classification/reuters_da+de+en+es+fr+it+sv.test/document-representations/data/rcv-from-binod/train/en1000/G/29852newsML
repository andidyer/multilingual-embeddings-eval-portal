Voters to choose Dade Cty mayor , Bucs stadium fate . Florida voters went to the polls Tuesday to choose the first mayor of Dade County to wield new increased powers , and to decide whether Hillsborough County should build a $ 168 million stadium for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Miami - area voters opted in the spring to adopt a strong - mayor form of government for Dade County . The winner will have significant influence over the county ' s $ 4 billion budget and will have veto power over decisions made by the 13 - member county commission . Eleven candidates are vying for the post , with frontrunners including County Commission Chairman Art Teele , county commissioners Maurice Ferre and Alex Penelas , and former Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez . If no one wins more than 50 percent of the votes , the two top candidates will compete in a run - off election October 1 . Dade County had a mayor until the post was abolished in a reorganization three years ago , but the job was largely ceremonial . In Hillsborough County , voters will decide whether to increase the sales tax a half cent , raising $ 2 . 7 billion over 30 years . Twelve percent of the new revenues raised would be used to pay debt service on a bond issue to finance a new stadium for the Bucs football team . The rest of the revenues would finance schools , roads , libraries and public safety projects , but the stadium has received the most attention . Opponents said the measure was worded deceptively and would largely benefit a for - profit football team . But they failed to persuade a judge to strike it from the ballot . The controversial issue spurred a flurry of new voter registration , with a record 9 , 000 residents signing up to vote during the final four days before the registration deadline , County Elections Supervisor Pam Iorio said . It was unclear whether most new voters favored or opposed the tax hike , but previous polls among likely voters suggested the measure would pass by a very narrow margin . Hillsborough County is also holding a Democratic primary election to decide who will succeed U . S . Senator Sam Gibbons , D - Tampa , in the 11th Congressional District . Vying for the spot are Hillsborough County Commissioner Phyllis Busansky , 59 ; state Rep . Jim Davis , 38 ; former state Sen . Pat Frank , 66 ; and former Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman , 52 . The winner will face Republican Mark Sharpe in the November general election . In Broward County , residents of the upscale Fort Lauderdale suburb of Weston will decide whether to incorporate as Broward ' s 29th city . The rapidly growing suburb has 18 , 000 residents . Supporters say incorporation would increase local control over zoning , development and spending , while opponents say it would almost certainly raise taxes . Also in Broward , city of Hollywood voters will decide whether to issue $ 37 milion of general obligation bonds for parks and other improvements . - - Jane Sutton , 305 374 - 5013

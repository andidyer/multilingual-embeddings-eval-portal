Indian PM Deve Gowda arrives in Bangladesh . Indian Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda arrived to a warm reception in Bangladesh on Monday , less than a month after the two countries signed a historic water - sharing accord that ended a decades - old dispute , He was received at the Dhaka airport by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and senior members of her cabinet . Bangladeshi airforce jets escorted Deve Gowda ' s aircraft to Dhaka after it entered Bangladesh ' s air space . As he descended from the plane , a red carpet was rolled out and the artillery fired 19 gunshots in his honour . The Indian leader also inspected a military guard . Deve Gowda , on his first visit to Dhaka , was accompanied by a 17 - member entourage , which includes External Affairs Minister Inder Kumar Gujral , Home Minister Indrajit Gupta and Foreign Secretary Salman Haider . Thousands of people lined both sides of a 17 - km ( 12 - mile ) highway , waving hands and flags , waiting for the two prime ministers to drive in a ceremonial motorcade from the airport to the state guest house " Jamuna " in the city centre . Officials in Dhaka described the visit as a landmark that would help cement bilateral relations after Hasina and Deve Gowda signed a 30 - year treaty in New Delhi last December on sharing water from the Ganges River , which flows through India and Bangladesh before emptying into the Bay of Bengal . The treaty ended a dispute rankling the two neighbours since 1974 , when India built a barrage on the Ganges to hold back water near its border with Bangladesh . The treaty ensures that lower riparian Bangladesh gets at least 35 , 000 cusecs ( cubic metres per second ) of Ganges water during the dry season to facilitate irrigation and navigation . Officials said the prime ministers would discuss the repatriation of Bangladeshi tribal refugees from India , trade and increasing cooperation among member - states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , which comprises the two nations , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Bhutan , Nepal and the Maldives . " The visit is a goodwill one but repatriation of the Chakma refugees , trade and SAARC matters will feature prominently in talks between the two premiers , " an official told Reuters . An official in Deve Gowda ' s office in New Delhi earlier said : " The prime minister is not going to Dhaka with a bag of demands or concessions . " The main focus of his visit would be on reviewing the growing , friendly relations between the two neighbours , he said . India helped Bangladesh win a 1971 independence war against Pakistan , but ties between Dhaka and New Delhi later entered a cold era , often soured by distrust and fear . Relations started improving after Hasina , daughter of Bangladesh ' s slain independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , came to power following a general election last June . The water accord put a " seal of trust " on warming ties , officials say . A widening trade gap in favour of India remains a major Bangladeshi concern . In 1995 / 96 ( July - June ) , Bangladesh imported goods worth $ 1 . 1 billion from India but its exports were a paltry $ 70 million , officials said .

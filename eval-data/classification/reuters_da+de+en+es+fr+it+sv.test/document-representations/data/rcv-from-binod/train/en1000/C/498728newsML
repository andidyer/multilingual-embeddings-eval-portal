Phillips says talks on PdVSA deal progressing . Phillips Petroelum Co said Thursday that talks with Venezuela ' s state oil company over a deal to expand its Texas plant are progressing . Phillips and Petroleos de Venezuela ( PdVSA ) operating company Corpoven are negotiating over a joint venture to build a coking unit at the 200 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) refinery , tied to a long - term deal to supply the plant with Venezuelan crude oil , are progressing . Analysts estimate that the project would cost around $ 1 billion . " We are negotiatiing with Corpoven to form a joint - venture to build a coker at Sweeny . . . and PdVSA would take a stake in that coker , " said a Phillips official . " This would include a long - term contract for supply of heavy crude to the refinery and we believe negotiations are moving forward satisfactorily , " he said . A coker is a deep - conversion unit that allows a plant to further process the residual fuel that is created through the catalytic cracking process into lighter , more valuable products , such as gasoline . Adding a coker makes it economic for a refinery to run heavy crude oil , such as that which Venezuela primarily produces . A Phillips source said that the two companies currently are conducting an engineering study which should be completed later this year . " To convert to a full slate of the heavy Venezuelan crudes you ' re probably talking about a project of around $ 1 billion , " said Blake Ersker , a consultant at Purvin & Gurtz , a Houston oil industry consultancy . Similar upgrading projects at Shell Oil ' s Deer Park , Texas and Lyondell - Citgo ' s Houston , Texas plants cost around $ 1 billion , Ersker noted . Though the Phillips official said there are no discussions about PdVSA taking a stake in the existing Sweeney plant , the upgrade would add about a third to the replacement cost of the plant . Also , refinery assets have been selling at deep discounts to book values in recent transactions , a factor which may make such project discussions tricky , industry sources said . - - ( ( New York Energy Desk , + 1 212 859 1623 ) )

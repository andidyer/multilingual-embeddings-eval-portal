SIMEX Taiwan stock futures seen taking off . Taiwan stock index futures traded on Singapore ' s futures exchange look set to take off as volumes reach new highs amid signs Taipei will lift a ban on trading of overseas contracts , dealers said on Thursday . The MSCI Taiwan index contract got off to a slow start after its launch on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) three months ago , triggering speculation about its viability in the absence of Taiwanese retail customers . But liquidity has been gradually rising , partly due to frantic trading of Taipei stocks in recent weeks . Turnover topped 3 , 000 lots for the first time on Thursday after exceeding 2 , 000 lots daily this week , dealers said . " There are increasing numbers of accounts being established . I suppose people would be interested once we ' re able to provide them with liquidity , " said Ang Swee Tian , president of SIMEX . Futures dealers said the market is still dominated by locals - - those who trade on their own account - - who are attracted by the contract ' s low initial margins and the recent lacklustre performance of Nikkei stock index futures . " There used to be about 10 to 15 locals about a month ago . Now it ' s more like 35 to 40 , " said Perry Gilbert , vice president of Refco Singapore Pte Ltd . Refco is itself a major broker for institutional clients in the Taiwan stock futures market and acts as order - filler for other houses , which are not yet trading the contract actively . " We could easily see volumes topping 3 , 000 - 3 , 500 lots on a good day . There ' s growing optimism , especially among professional traders , " Gilbert said . He said the planned launch of the contract on SIMEX ' s after - hours automated trading system would also boost interest . The exchange has not yet decided a date to begin screen trading of the contract , which now trades in an open outcry session from 0045 GMT to 0415 GMT during the week and from 0045 GMT to 0315 GMT on Saturdays . In a recent circular to members , SIMEX said electronic trading would take place from 0500 GMT to 1700 GMT on weekdays . " The volume has definitely picked up but there ' s still a reluctance to trade among the big houses . Maybe daily volumes would need to hit 3 , 000 - 3 , 500 lots for them to get involved , " said Mark Falconer , sales desk manager at NatWest Futures . Some dealers attributed the recent increase in volumes to Taiwanese players skirting the ban by placing orders through smaller offshore trading companies . " They usually go through a bucket shop , which would open an account with one of the houses . And that ' s hard to trace , " said a trader with a local futures house . But Falconer said Taiwanese participation was unlikely to be a major factor as 70 percent of the market was still dominated by locals . " Taiwan is talking about repealing the ban and people always jump the gun on things like that . But we ' re not talking about waves of money coming in from Taiwan , " he said . Taiwan ' s Finance Minister Paul Chiu said on March 5 that Taipei would lift a ban on local trading of Taiwan index futures on SIMEX and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) this month . Ang said SIMEX was still awaiting word from the Taiwanese authorities on the repeal of the ban , which he said would greatly help the development of the contract . " Certainly it would open up a very big segment of the potential market , " he said . The CME and SIMEX both launched Taiwan stock index futures on January 9 despite strong objections from Taiwan regulators who wanted them to wait until Taipei could open its futures market and launch its own stock index contracts .

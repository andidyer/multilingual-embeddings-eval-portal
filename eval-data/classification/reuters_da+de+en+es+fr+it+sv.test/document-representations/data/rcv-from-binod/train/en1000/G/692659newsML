New French government opposes full return to NATO . France ' s left - wing government said on Friday that the time was not ripe for Paris to return to the military wing of NATO but left the next move to Gaullist President Jacques Chirac . Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said it was up to Chirac to decide whether to pursue the initiative because it was Chirac who had proposed France ' s return to the military wing . France pulled out in 1966 under General Charles de Gaulle , accusing the alliance of being dominated by Washington . " Without prejudging the president ' s assessment , conditions set to pursue the process do not seem to be fulfilled , " Rummelhardt told a news briefing ahead of a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Madrid next month . The statement appeared to be a reminder to Chirac , who will represent France at the summit , of the position of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin . Jospin , who has shared power with the conservative president since the Left won a parliamentary election on June 1 , will not be going to MadridA spokesman for the Elysee presidential palace said there would be no immediate comment on Chirac ' s intentions . In Brussels , NATO officials said the alliance would respect Paris ' decision but carry on working towards that goal . The officials said there had been a rapprochement between France and its allies in military affairs over recent years and they expected this to continue even if the country remained formally out of the military wing . " What is important is that the ' ad hoc ' arrangements employed in recent years continue , " one official said . As a condition for a return to full NATO participation , Chirac had demanded that the United States hand over to a European officer NATO ' s southern command , the Naples - based AFSOUTH which includes the U . S . Mediterranean Sixth Fleet . Washington , which also runs NATO ' s supreme command based in Belgium , has rejected the French condition , saying this month it had stopped trying to resolve the long - running dispute . Rummelhardt said the issues to be debated at the July 8 summit " concern both the president and the prime minister " . " Regarding France and NATO , the president of the Republic has taken the initiative of a rapprochement . . . It is natural that he assess himself whether he should go further in that direction , " he said . Privately Jospin aides said dropping the NATO initiative buoyed both Jospin and Chirac by eliminating a potentially contentious issue from their shared agenda . Parallel to their stand - off over AFSOUTH , Washington and Paris are also at odds over the alliance ' s enlargement , another issue likely to stir Franco - American differences in Madrid . At the summit , NATO is due to invite some countries from formerly communist Europe to join the alliance . The United States wants only Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic to be asked while France supports a broader enlargement including Slovenia and Romania . The issue of the command of NATO ' s strategic southern flank is part of a troubled wider reform of the alliance ' s outdated command structures , aimed at creating a European defence pillar within NATO . U . S . Defence Secretary William Cohen said earlier this month the issue had been deferred following the election of Jospin ' s Socialist - led government , and Chirac aides confirmed that talks had at least been suspended temporarily . Chirac has pushed for the creation of a greater role for Europeans within an expanded NATO as part of a restructuring to enable it to carry out more Bosnia - style peace missions outside its traditional area of operation . The French Socialists have upbraided him for abandoning France ' s policy of trying to create a separate European defence identity and leading the country back into the military wing of the U . S . - dominated military bloc .

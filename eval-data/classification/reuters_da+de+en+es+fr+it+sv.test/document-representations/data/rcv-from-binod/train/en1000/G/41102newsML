Mexico presidency denies anti - opposition campaign . A spokesman for Mexican President Carlos Zedillo denied Monday that the government was conducting a campaign to discredit members of the country ' s biggest opposition group , the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) . In remarks published by newspapers , PAN president Felipe Calderon said hardliners within President Ernesto Zedillo ' s government were conducting campaigns intended to frighten the electorate away from voting for his party ' s candidates . " The crude strategy against the PAN is being tolerated , if not stimulated , by the group which from the presidency and from the government corridors of power try to control the media , " the Reforma newspapers quoted Calderon as saying . Presidential spokesman Carlos Almada replied : " The only thing which is promoted and spread from ( the presidency ) is the unity of the Mexican people and respect for all political parties . " Almada made the remarks to reporters before leaving with Zedillo on a one - day trip to Guatemala . The spokesman also said that former PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos " had always received respectful and courteous treatment from ( Zedillo ) . " In recent days , pro - government media , such as the Televisa television network , have broadcast repeated attacks on Fernandez de Cevallos for allegedly failing to pay property taxes on prime development land in the Pacific tourist resort of Acapulco .

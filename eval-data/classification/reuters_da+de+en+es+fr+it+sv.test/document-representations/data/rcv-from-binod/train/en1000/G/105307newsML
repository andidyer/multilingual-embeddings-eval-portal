Israel , PLO strike cautiously positive tone . Israel and PLO have sounded cautiously positive notes about their talks on implementing an Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron . A Palestinian negotiator , who said Israel was now studying his side ' s proposals for increased security that would not alter the Hebron deal signed with the Jewish state ' s previous government , said Israel might have seen the light . " Apparently , the Israelis have come to understand the agreement has to be adhered to and they are studying the agreement , " Hassan Asfour told Reuters at the end of talks on Wednesday . Talks resume on Thursday . " A serious and detailed discussion has taken place , " an Israeli participant at the U . S . - mediated meeting in the Palestinian self - rule enclave in the Gaza Strip quoted Israeli delegation head Dan Shomron as saying . Shomron said no agreement had been reached but " mutual accusations had been laid aside " . Palestinian delegation head Saeb Erekat had said earlier on Wednesday the Hebron talks , which opened on Sunday , were deadlocked . Erekat had said Israel wanted to rewrite the deal . He said if Israel wanted increased security it could move the 400 Jews living amid 100 , 000 Palestinians in Hebron to the adjacent Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement . Erekat was cautious about optimism after Wednesday ' s talks . " I think that we made it very , very clear to the Israelis that the agreement cannot be changed . . . I really hope , and I ' m not sure whether they got the message . . . but I really hope that the Israeli side will really start doing business and implement the agreement . " Asfour said : " The Israeli side is studying Palestinian proposals to set up a security system that is consistent with the agreement and does not change the agreement and maintains security for both sides . " Israel agreed more than a year ago to redeploy in Hebron by March of this year but delayed after Palestinian bombers opposed to the peace process killed 59 people in Israel . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June after May elections . Palestinians doubt his word he will keep the signed peace deals . Fifty - nine Arabs and 15 Israelis died in clashes last month over Israeli policies in Arab East Jerusalem . Palestinian officials earlier had said the Israeli delegation to the Hebron talks proposed changes that would reduce the number of Palestinian police allowed in Hebron and insisted they be armed with pistols rather than rifles . The Israelis also wanted to keep control of parts of the town due to be transferred to the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) under the existing agreement . Erekat countered that Palestinians had their own security concerns . A Jewish settler massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers at Hebron ' s al - Ibrahimi mosque in 1994 . U . S . envoy Dennis Ross , mediating at the talks , in a statement he said the parties had asked him to issue on their behalf , commented : " Both sides have now begun the process of finding ways to address the concerns of the other . " The toll the lack of peace is exacting on Israel ' s business front - - it has already badly damaged the Palestinian economy - - increased on Wednesday . Plasson Ltd , a leading maker of plastic connectors and the first Israeli company to seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange , decided on Wednesday to put off the offering due to political tension in the Middle East , the sponsors said .

German soldiers reinforce dikes against flood risk . Thousands of soldiers and aid workers in eastern Germany raced on Monday to plug holes in leaking dikes and build up a second line of defence against the swollen Oder River . Officials said around 12 , 000 people were working to repair dozens of weak points in dikes across the region while hundreds more raced to raise the level of a second flood wall behind the main dike in the Oderbruch area . Residents were kept on evacuation alert but many said they would not leave , despite the fact that the floods have claimed more than 100 lives in neighbouring Poland and the Czech Republic . Czech and Polish officials said flood waters were now receding but the economic impact of the catastrophe was underlined when Warsaw said it might issue special bonds next year to raise funds for reconstruction in the worst - hit areas . Rivers across Romania spilled their banks at the weekend , drowning one man and prompting the evacuation of thousands of people , officials said . The German Defence Ministry said it had 8 , 500 soldiers in the flood zone and another 5 , 500 on standby in the country ' s largest civilian relief operation to help with evacuations and shore up dikes with sandbags . " We ' re seeing that the dikes are slowly disintegrating and revealing more and more weak points , " said Michael Muth , the head of the crisis centre in Brandenburg , the German state worst hit by the flooding . The Oderbruch basin is particularly vulnerable as it lies below the level of the swollen Oder , protected only by a 70 km ( 45 mile ) section of dike . Officials said the water level there was rising by the hour . Up to 76 , 165 hectares of farmland in four districts , of which 64 , 388 hectares are arable area , would be at risk if the fertile plateau were to be completely flooded . " The important thing now is to clearly express to the farmers that they will receive unbureaucratic assistance , " German Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert told reporters in the village of Kienitz during a visit to the region . He said he had already written to the European Commission to request aid for farmers affected by the floods . It was too early to say how much aid would be needed , Borchert said . German reinsurer Munich Re , which released the 10 billion mark ( $ 5 . 4 billion ) damage estimate , said it would take time to assess the full effects of the floods . It said total insurance costs could be below previous estimates of 1 . 5 billion marks . " We are also assuming that far from all the risks were covered by insurance , " board member Wolf Otto Bauer said . On the Polish side of the Oder , in the town of Slubice , authorities had ordered a mass evacuation at the weekend . Officials said the town had survived the onslaught of the raging river but were also desperately fighting to maintain eroded and soaked protection dikes . " The flood situation is stabilising . Slubice has so far resisted the river . . . but the fight to save the sodden dikes continues , " crisis committee spokesman Krzysztof Pomes said . In the Oderbruch , around 9 , 000 people were " sitting on their suitcases " in 24 villages which have been put on alert for possible evacuation . Nearly 5 , 000 people were evacuated from the most endangered area of the region on Friday . But despite warnings of a new wave of high water rolling down the Oder , many residents said they planned to stay put . " I ' m not leaving . Where am I supposed to bring all my animals ? " said Waltrud Wassenberg , walking a German shepherd dog through to a large lake where water had seeped through the dike just a few hundred metres ( yards ) from her home . Other residents in the village of Bleyen said water cresting near the top of the dike was not unusual in this area . " I ' ve been living here for 30 years . The water levels are normal , " said Rudi Goellnitz , one of the many dike inspectors who walk up and down the dam placing yellow flags in the ground where water is seeping through so emergency workers can spot areas that need reinforcing with sandbags . In the Czech Republic , where the floods have caused 49 deaths , floodwaters fell further on Monday with only a few villages still on alert . Czech weather forecasters said they expected little rain in the next few days , allowing the Oder and Elbe rivers to continue their retreats from low - lying land . East Germans , on the other hand , could not yet afford to breathe a sigh of relief . " The situation is in no way stable and the dangers aren ' t over by a long way , " said Brandenburg premier Manfred Stolpe . " The main task at the moment is to build up defences and to deploy all forces to prevent the worst happening . " ( $ = 1 . 842 German Marks )

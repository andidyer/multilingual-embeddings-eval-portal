Canada Senate hearing on Somalia aborted by Tories . A Canadian Senate inquiry into Canada ' s ill - fated peacekeeping mission to Somalia was abandoned late on Thursday when opposition senators pledged to boycott the hearings , the Canadian Press reported . Conservative senators , led by John Lynch - Staunton and Lowell Murray , stormed out of a 90 - minute meeting to organise the hearings late on Thursday . They complained about witness selection and the reams of evidence they were expected to go through by Monday , CP reported . The Tories were also upset that outside counsel and researchers had not been hired to help the Senate inquiry . The Liberal majority in the Senate , Canada ' s upper house of parliament , said it would be unethical to go forward without opposition senators and cancelled the hearings , the news agency said . The hearings , which were to begin on Monday , were supposed to be an extension of the original inquiry into Canada ' s mission to Somalia in 1993 , during which several Somalis died at the hands of Canadian troops . The inquiry was abandoned when the federal government cut short its mandate at the end of March and ordered the three - man commission to submit a report by the end of June . Liberal Senator Bill Rompkey , chairman of the Senate committee , told reporters he would contact Tory senators on Friday to see if the hearings could be salvaged but he did not hold out much hope , the news agency reported . Witnesses to the hearings were to face questions in connection with allegations that top Defence Department officials deliberately kept former prime minister Kim Campbell , now consul - general in Los Angeles , in the dark about the torture - murder of Somali teenager Shidane Arone in March 1993 . Campbell was defence minister at the time . If Prime Minister Jean Chretien drops an election writ at the end of the month , as is widely expected , it would be up to the next Parliament to decide if there ever will be Senate hearings into the Somalia affair , Rompkey said . The Senate committee would be eliminated if an election were called and that could effectively sideline the issue during a campaign .

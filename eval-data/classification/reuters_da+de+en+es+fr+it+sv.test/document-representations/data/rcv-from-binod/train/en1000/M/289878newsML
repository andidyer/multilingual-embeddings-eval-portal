Taiwan stocks end higher in mild rebound . Taiwan share prices closed higher on Monday in a rebound from Saturday ' s big 1 . 64 percent fall as recent political uncertainties appeared to ease , brokers said . The index ended 24 . 40 points or 0 . 36 percent higher at 6 , 844 . 75 , off a 6 , 865 . 07 high . Turnover was a modest T $ 35 . 7 billion . Analysts said there were still political worries following the shock New Year ' s Eve resignation of Taiwan ' s governor , who refuses to support a central government plan to dismantle his largely redundant provincical administration . But experts said the political damage appeared limited . " Tension eased after Premier Lien Chan met governor James Soong on Sunday night , though Soong still insisted he ' d resign , " said Nomura Securities analyst Ben Lee . Brokers said the rebound was not strong because many funds transferred buying to the young over - the - counter stock market . " About seven or eight new trust funds are expected to raise T $ 40 billion for investment in the OTC market in January , so many investors have bought OTC shares beforehand , " Lee said . Also , he said , some investors were sidelined awaiting the January 9 launch of Taiwan stock - index futures by the Chicago Mercantile Exchanges and Singapore ' s SIMEX . " Investors prefer the OTC market in the near term over the main stock exchange due to the CME and SIMEX moves , " Lee said . Local investors are legally barred from trading the offshore stock derivatives , though many are expected to do so anyway through offshore accounts at overseas brokerages . Electronics shares led Monday ' s rebound to end a recent consolidation , with computer giant Acer up 40 cents to T $ 50 . Chemicals also were strong . Brokers said state - owned postal funds entered to support the market at 6 , 800 . A 6 , 800 - 6 , 950 range was seen for the week . - - James Peng ( 5080815 )

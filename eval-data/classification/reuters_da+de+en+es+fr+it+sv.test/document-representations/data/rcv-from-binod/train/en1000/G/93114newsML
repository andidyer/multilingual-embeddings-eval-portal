SOCCER - LIECHTENSTEIN LOOK FOR FIRST GOAL AGAINST LITHUANIA . Liechtenstein coach Dietr Weise named just one full - time player , Basle midfielder Mario Frick , on Thursday in the squad for their group eight World Cup qualifier against Lithuania . Playing in World Cup qualifying for the first time , not only will the part - timers from Liechtenstein be looking for their first point but their first international goal after being shut out 3 - 0 by Macedonia and 5 - 0 by Ireland . Lithuania , beaten 3 - 0 by Romania in their opening qualifier , must first face Iceland in another group eight match on Saturday before hosting Liechtenstein in Vilnius on October 9 . Weise faces problems uncommon to most national coaches in that he has to hope his players will be released from their jobs to play . Midfielder Ralf Oehri is not available for the match because he has been unable to get time off from his new job . Weise has called - up 19 year - old striker Alexander Schaedler but it is Frick , who has scored five goals this season in the Swiss league , who will lead the attack . " I ' m hopeful , " said Weise . " We ' ve played some close friendlies against Estonia and Latvia and I believe we have a small chance of taking a point . " Squad : Goalkeepers - Martin Heeb ( FC Vaduz ) , Martin Oehry ( SV Frastanz ) Defenders - Thomas Hanselmann ( FC Balzers ) , Daniel Hasler ( FC Vaduz ) , Stefan Hassler ( USV Eschen ) , Patrik Hefti ( Vaduz ) , Roland Hilti ( FC Schaan ) , Juergen Ospelt ( USV Eschen ) , Alex Quaderer ( FC Vaduz ) , Martin Stocklasa ( USV Eschen ) Midfielders - Philipp Beck ( USV Eschen ) , Patrik Marxer ( USV Eschen ) , Franz Schaedler ( Triesenberg ) , Daniel Telser ( FC Balzers ) , Harry Zech ( FC Vaduz ) Attackers - Mario Frick ( Basle , Switzerland ) , Alexander Schaedler ( USV Eschen ) .

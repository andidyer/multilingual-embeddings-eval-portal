Argentine economy minister defends policies - papers . Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez angrily responded to criticisms of his free - market policies leveled by the powerful governor of Buenos Aires province , newspapers reported Wednesday . Gov . Eduardo Duhalde , considered the frontrunner in the increasingly open race within the governing Peronist Party to succeed President Carlos Menem , had criticized Fernandez ' s orthodox free - market economic policies , dismissing them as " outdated in every part of the world . " Duhalde favors the creation of a Ministry of Production , which would take responsibility for kindling economic growth and relieve the Economy Ministry of some of its powers . Fernandez was adamant that no new ministry would be created , according to the newspaper reports . " Everything is going to stay the same , " he said , quoted by the daily La Nacion . " We don ' t see a necessity or a reason . " Fernandez said he was confident he had the backing of Menem . " It would seem that the only opposition to Peronism comes from the opposition of Peronists themselves . " Duhalde earlier told local radio that Fernandez ' s policies " follow orthodox economic theories based on the idea that the market alone will regulate growth , and that trickle - down will mean that problems of injustice or social exclusion are solved . That ' s outdated in every part of the world . " The Peronist Party is preparing for mid - term congressional elections in October . Menem ' s second term ends in 1999 , and the constitution bars him from serving a third . ( ( - - Jason Webb , Buenos Aires Newsroom + 541 415 - 2571 )

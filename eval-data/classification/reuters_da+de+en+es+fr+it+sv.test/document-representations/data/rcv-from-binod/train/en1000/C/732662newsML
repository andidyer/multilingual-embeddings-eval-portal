AT & T says Walter resigns . AT & T Corp . said Wednesday that President John Walter resigned nearly nine months after he was chosen as the heir apparent to Chief Executive Officer Robert Allen . The company said its board voted not to promote him to chief executive officer , succeeding Allen . At the time of his appointment last October , some industry officials wondered whether Walter , former chairman of printer R . R . Donnelley & Sons , would be able to lead AT & T effectively in the highly competitive telecommunications market . Walter , 50 , appointed in October , joined AT & T last November and was expected to succeed Allen as CEO in January 1998 . The resignation came after the board decided it was not ready to name him CEO on the schedule originally discussed , the nation ' s largest long - distance company said . The resignation followed months of speculation that Walter might be passed over as Allen ' s successor if AT & T ' s reported merger talks with SBC Communications Inc . had led to a merger . SBC Chairman Ed Whiteacre was said to be in line to replace Allen as head of the combined company . The AT & T board also said a special committee would conduct a search for a CEO and recommend a successor . It also named John Zeglis , 50 , only recently named vice chairman , to lead AT & T operations , with operating heads reporting to Zeglis . The company ' s law , government affairs , human resources and public relations departments , which now report to Zeglis , will report directly to Allen . The recent elevation of Zeglis to vice chairman had stoked further speculation that Walter ' s career at AT & T was in danger . The company said it will report its second quarter earnings Monday , and it expects its financial results to be within the range of analysts ' estimates . AT & T stock which was trading slightly below its opening price , jumped more than a $ 1 to 36 - 5 / 16 following news of Walter ' s resignation . Under the terms of his employment contract with AT & T , Walter , who also resigned as a director of the company , will receive separation payments of about $ 3 . 8 million . That is in addition to the compensation package of about $ 22 million AT & T provided him to replace salary , pension and bonuses he forfeited when he left R . R . Donnelley & Sons last October after nine years as chief executive " John Walter is an energetic leader who made important contributions to AT & T in a relatively short period , " said Walter Elisha , " but the Board has decided it will not elect him CEO by next January , as originally foreseen . " " Therefore , John has decided to leave the company , exercising rights under his employment contract , and we wish him well , " Elisha said . In the AT & T statment , Walter said his immediate plans were uncertain . " I believe I am perfectly qualified to be CEO of AT & T right now , " John Walter said . " I have worked tirelessly on behalf of the shareholders of AT & T . " In addition , the leaders of AT & T ' s international operations will report to Somers in his capacity as a member of the company ' s Operations Team , and the president of AT & T Labs , Dr . David Nagel , will report to Petrillo . Somers and Zeglis will report to Allen and , with him , will constitute the AT & T Chairman ' s Office . Zeglis had previously served as AT & T ' s chief corporate counsel and head of government regulatory affairs among other duties . He has held a variety of responsibilities in the past year of turmoil among the senior ranks of management at AT & T . Joining Zeglis as members of the Operations Team are Frank Ianna , who heads the company ' s network and computing services business , Gail McGovern , who runs its consumer markets business , John Petrillo , head of corporate strategy and business development ; Dan Somers , AT & T ' s recently named chief financial officer , and Jeff Weitzen , who heads AT & T ' s business markets group . The independent director ' s committee consists of Kenneth Derr , chairman and CEO of Chevron Corp . , Walter Elisha , chairman and chief executive of Springs Industries Inc . Donald McHenry , president of the IRC Group . Ralph Larsen , chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson ; and Thomas Wyman , senior advisor of SBC Warburg Inc .

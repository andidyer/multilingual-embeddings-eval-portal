Ecuador wants to speed oil pipeline expansion . Ecuador wants to accelerate the expansion of the Trans - Ecuadorean oil pipeline , a government official in charge of the project has said . " We think there is no time for further delays . We have to push ahead with the project and finish it as soon as possible because it is vital for the country ' s needs at the moment , " project manager Santiago Pastor said late Thursday . " A lot of money has already been lost because of delays in the project , " he said . Government oil officials said at the end of March that the expansion could be finished within eight months if international firms were brought into the project . State oil firm Petrecuador last week called for firms to tender by March 17 for the expansion , which should increase the pipeline ' s capacity to 410 , 000 barrels a day from 330 , 000 barrels a day . The governemnt thinks the expansion should cost $ 80 million . Ecuador produces about 390 , 000 barrels a day of crude oil , of which 330 , 000 barrels are transported in the Trans - Ecuadorean pipeline . The rest is carried by the Trans - Andes pipeline . Pastor said the pipeline expansion should allow Petroecuador to develop new fields in the Amazon . Ecuador is Latin America ' s third largest oil exporter .

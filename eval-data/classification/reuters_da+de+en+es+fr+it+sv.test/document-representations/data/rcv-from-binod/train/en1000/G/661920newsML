Kohl deputy warns on dangers of delaying euro . The parliamentary leader of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democrats said on Saturday that delaying the launch of the single European currency could cause turbulence on currency markets and endanger the whole project . Wolfgang Schaeuble said in an interview with Der Speigel news weekly that the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) and the Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union ( CSU ) in parliament fully backed the government ' s position supporting a timely euro launch . " There is no doubt about the fact that the euro will be a stable currency , " said Schaeuble , Kohl ' s top lieutenant and a leading candidate to one day succeed the chancellor . " The decisive issue is that the conditions for a lasting stability are not endangered . The countries joining the euro will be picked in the spring of 1997 based on their fiscal data from 1997 . Germany will make it . " Schaeuble said there were only a few CDU and CSU politicians in favour of stopping the economic and monetary union ( EMU ) . He said some politicians on both the right - and left - wing " fringes " were whipping up anti - euro fears in Germany . " But the CDU / CSU as a whole , in any case those in parliament , uniformly support Helmut Kohl and Theo Waigel in putting everything now behind currency union because a delay would bring the danger of failure and unfavourable speculative trends on the currency markets .

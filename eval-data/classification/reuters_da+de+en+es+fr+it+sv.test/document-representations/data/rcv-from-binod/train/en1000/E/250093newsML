Bank of England makes no move on interest rates . The Bank of England signalled no change in official interest rates from the present 6 . 0 percent in its 1400 GMT money market operations . The Bank provided the money market with assistance of 235 million stg at the established 5 - 15 / 16 percent rate . However , analysts said the possibility that official rates might be adjusted on Thursday morning could not be ruled out . The central bank normally does not change interest rates on the same day as a monetary meeting if it has already conducted money market operation at existing rates . Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank Governor Eddie George ended today ' s monetary meeting at around 1150 GMT and the Bank ' s first operations were at 1207 GMT . The uncertainty about whether a move might have been deferred means traders will be glued to their screens at 0950 to 1000 GMT on Thursday , when the Bank announces its forecast of the daily liquidity shortage and conducts any operations . Clarke , who has the final say on monetary policy , raised rates unexpectedly by a quarter - point to 6 . 0 percent on October 30 . The Bank has since warned that rates will have to rise again to ward off an upsurge in inflation , but George said last week there was no urgent need for a dramatic increase . Clarke and George are likely to have already seen November retail price inflation data , which are to be published on Thursday . The Reuters consensus forecast is for underlying inflation ( excluding mortgage interest payments ) to have stuck at the 3 . 3 percent level to which it jumped in October , well above the government ' s 2 . 5 percent target . A Reuters poll of 21 economists showed none expected a rate increase this month . - - Richard Murphy , London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774

Turkish president begins visit to Italy . Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on Monday discussed his country ' s relations with the European Union ( EU ) and Kurdish demands for autonomy with Italian politicians during the first day of a two - day official visit . Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro , in his toast at the start of a state dinner on Monday evening , said he believed a solution could be found to the Kurdish issue . " Italy understands the particular difficulties that the legacy of history places in front of our Turkish friends in its relations with a population , that of the Kurds - - also our friends , also a victim of its past and profoundly divided in its interior , " Scalfaro said . " At the same time , Rome is convinced that in a phase of international cooperation in which new prospects of peace and progress for all nations are opening , the good will and far - sightedness of all interested parties make possible the definitions of equitable solutions which respect the rights of all in whatever controversy , " Scalfaro said . Raising the issue of Turkey ' s ties to the EU , Scalfaro said : " Belonging to the European family means above all else sharing the patrimony of the civil , moral and political values of Europe . " In this context , my country supports a closer integration of Turkey in the European Union , " he said . Turkey entered into a customs union with the EU last January . But last month the European Parliament , angered by what it sees as Turkey ' s reneging on promises to improve its human rights record , said it would block hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to Ankara . Senator Gian Giacomo Migone , who is president of the upper house ' s foreign affairs committee , told reporters that Turkey ' s ties to the EU also were discussed during a meeting between Demirel and Italian parliamentarians . " I told Demirel that ties between Turkey and the European Union were more than an alliance because the EU is a community and therefore one has to agree with the values of that community , " Migone said . Demirel will meet Italian government leaders and FIAT car chief Cesare Romiti on Tuesday .

RTRS - WEEK AHEAD - Australian markets await jobs data . Australian equity and financial market traders , recovering from the shock of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan ' s warning about exuberant prices , will this week turn their attention to local data in an attempt determine when rates will again be cut . The surprise warning by Greenspan , which sent regional and European markets into a tailspin on Friday , had a more muted response in the United States where a weak November payrolls report offset some of the Fed chairman ' s potential impact . Local traders and economists said Australian jobs data for November to be released on Thursday will be the key indicator for the week , but cautioned that regional markets will continue to remain sensitive while the Greenspan comments are properly dissected . Wide - ranging forecasts call for Australian employment to rise by about 10 , 000 in November compared with October ' s 26 , 000 rise , but the predictions gyrate from a fall of 18 , 000 to a jump of 30 , 000 . Economists said an outcome which showed little real growth in employment would add weight to the call for another interest rate cut in the near - term , probably sometime in the New Year . The Reserve Bank board has already already met for the last time in 1996 , leaving rates unchanged at 6 . 5 percent when its board met last Tuesday . Rates were last cut by 50 basis points on November 6 . Moderate jobs growth is likely to result in a further reduction in wage pressures , and together with declines in consumer price inflation should open the door for a rate cut in the first quarter of 1997 , investment bank Paine Webber said . Economists said other data to be issued this week which should contribute to the rate cut argument include ANZ Job Vacancies on Monday , Westpac / ACCI industrial trends data on Tuesday , and a swag of data on Wednesday including October housing finance , September quarter foreign debt and the Westpac consumer sentiment index for December . U . S . data out this week is likely to be positive for bond markets , said the Westpac Institutional and International Banking Group . November U . S . producer price index figures on Wednesday followed by the consumer price index on Thursday are expected to confirm still slumbering price pressures at both the production and retail levels , Westpac said . Meanwhile , the other major release of the week , November retail sales on Thursday , should show growth of 0 . 3 percent , which would confirm that U . S . private consumer spending remains subdued in late 1996 , Westpac said . AUSTRALIAN BONDS ( Fri 10 - yr cash 7 . 49 pct , 3 - yr cash 6 . 74 ) The Australian bond market will start the week in better shape than last Friday ' s wild session after slightly weaker non - farm payrolls in the United States helped to stabilise global debt markets overnight Friday . At the end of after hours trading on Saturday the 10 - year bond futures contract stood at 92 . 630 , implying a cash yield of around 7 . 37 percent . The market suffered its largest one - day fall since March on Friday with the 10 - year bond spiking over 7 . 50 percent as a weak U . S . bond market combined with signs of a strong local economy dimished expectations of a near - term rate cut . Out of a host of local data this week , it will be Australia ' s own labour force report on Thursday which will be the most closely watched to see if there is any improvement in the unemployment rate . Unemployment stood at 8 . 8 percent in October , with most economists expecting a slight fall to 8 . 7 percent in November . Their predictions range from a fall to 8 . 4 percent and a rise to 9 . 0 percent . A fall in the rate , or a strong rise in employment , is likely to further pressurise a fragile market given that the Reserve Bank had partly based its recent easier policy stance on the poor state of the labour market . AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR ( Fri close US $ 0 . 7950 / 55 , NY $ 0 . 7971 / 76 ) The Australian dollar faces a tense time after a seismic shift last week saw it sink from a six - year high of US $ 0 . 8212 to end Friday at US $ 0 . 7950 / 55 . Support had emerged for the unit at US $ 0 . 7950 from domestic corporates and funds who saw the dollar ' s retreat as a good chance to take much needed forex cover . Offshore investors , particularly Japanese houses and U . S . banks had offers in the US $ 0 . 7995 / 8010 area which had effectively capped it , and could well do so until year - end . Indeed , dealers and analysts believe a protracted bout of consolidation could be in store between US $ 0 . 7850 and US $ 0 . 8050 , with the long term direction decided by which broke first . The domestic data for release this week will be almost irrelevant compared to what happens in offshore bond and equity markets . But economists said November employment and October housing finance could have implications for domestic monetary policy which may offer short term direction for the dollar . A weak jobs report , in particular , will make another rate cut seem a lot more likely and could see the dollar test major support . AUSTRALIAN SHARES ( Fri All Ords 2313 . 90 , - 69 . 40 ) Friday ' s comments by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan are likely to have a lingering effect on the Australian share market , trader said , especially on Monday . They said a weaker - expected payrolls report from the U . S . should temper some of the potential downturn in the local market but noted that Greenspan ' s comments were directed at equity markets and that Wall St took this hard on Friday , ending 55 points lower on Friday . " The entire week has been a lead up to today ( Friday ) and Monday will be crunch time , " said dealer Scott Mailer of Daiwa Securities , who focussed on the potential for a large U . S . payrolls result . " If that figure does come out worse than expectations , we know Greenspan won ' t have any qualms about raising interest rates in the U . S . and that will filter through here and crunch our market . " Analysts said there are few corporate events of any great significance this week , with the highlight being the first annual profit result from the recently - listed insurance group , National Mutual Holdings . Its results to September 30 are due on Wednesday . Annual meetings include pay TV group Australis Media and chemicals producer Incitec on Wednesday while Incitec ' s 70 percent shareholder , ICI Australia , meets on Friday . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

S & P MAY DOWNGRADE POSCO LONG - TERM CREDIT RATING . Standard & Poor ' s Corp said on Thursday that it had placed its A + long - term credit rating of Pohang Iron & Steel Co Ltd on credit watch with negative implications . POSCO ' s credit quality could deteriorate if the company succeeded in acquiring the assets of the failed Hanbo Steel Co from creditor banks , S & P said in a statement . Even if the rating was changed , it was not likely to fall below A because of the benefits deriving from POSCO ' s dominant position in the Korean steel market , its highly efficient , low - cost production facilities , and strong cash flow from operations , S & P said . POSCO would be removed from credit watch once the situation regarding the Hanbo Steel sale became clear , S & P said .

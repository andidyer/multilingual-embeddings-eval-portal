Precious metals slump despite upturn in demand . Just as seasonal demand for precious metals is picking up , prices have tumbled . Gold is weak . Silver is at an 18 - month low . Platinum and palladium are cheaper than at any time in three years . And the retreat may continue amid fiercely bearish sentiment even as demand strengthens , analysts said . " If there is a view in the market , it is usually strong enough to override the seasonal factor , " bullion analyst Andy Smith of Union Bank of Switzerland said on Wednesday . " It seems since the end of August the ( investment ) funds have had a view , and they ' re pessimistic , " he added . Typically , the middle of September is a signal for an increase in gold demand from Asia as well as from U . S . and European jewellery fabricators . But any seasonal boost has been overshadowed so far by a big speculative play led by U . S . funds last week . It sent silver plunging below its key $ 5 an ounce level , and its weakness has spilled over into the other precious metals . Gold , already stuck in a protracted downtrend , reacted to silver ' s sell - off by easing to fresh two - month lows just above the technically significant $ 380 an ounce level . Bullion closed at $ 382 . 65 an ounce on Wednesday , compared to around $ 415 at the start of the year . Technical analysts who study charts of historical prices to calculate future trends , said gold ' s staying power above $ 380 held the key to the rest of the precious metals . " We ' ve got a divergence between gold and silver at the moment , where silver seems to be breaking down and gold isn ' t , " said Cliff Green of Trend Analysis . " It ' s all eyes on gold - - if it remains above $ 380 , then maybe there ' s upside potential for silver . " If not , however , the complex is liable to crumble further . Silver had dropped to 18 - month lows last week and was still vulnerable to losses to as low as $ 4 . 50 an ounce , Green said . On Wednesday it was off lows but still vulnerable , closing at $ 4 . 92 an ounce . Silver , an industrial metal , is more volatile than gold and therefore an obvious target for speculators . " It ' s very easy to move the silver market around and I guess people got tired of waiting for see prices move up to $ 6 , " said Kevin Crisp , an analyst at JP Morgan . Platinum and palladium have also come under pressure from silver after being undermined over the summer by steady supplies from producer Russia and slack industrial demand . Platinum has hovered around 2 - 1 / 2 year lows in recent days and its stablemate palladium dipped to three - year lows . Analysts said demand for gold bullion will rise as jewellers establish inventories for Christmas and Chinese New Year . " Demand is looking reasonably good at this point , " said Crisp of J . P . Morgan . " The sentiment is uniformly bearish for the metals , but that could mean there are some surprises in store . " But so far , the demand trickling in has done little more than put support under the market rather than lead prices up . " The physical demand is taking up the surplus and slowing the decline . It ' s not enough to tip the balance , " a dealer said . That ' s because professional investors have turned up their noses at the precious metals . Gold ' s traditionally role as a " safe haven " in times of political and economic crisis has been called into question as investors turn to more profitable stocks and bonds . A proposal by the International Monetary Fund to sell some gold reserves has also cast a pall on gold , though analysts say the market would easily absorb the amount in question . " Funds are fickle , they don ' t care if it ' s gold or green cheese . They bought it in January , they ' re selling it now . The flucutations and flows are background noise , " UBS ' s Smith said .

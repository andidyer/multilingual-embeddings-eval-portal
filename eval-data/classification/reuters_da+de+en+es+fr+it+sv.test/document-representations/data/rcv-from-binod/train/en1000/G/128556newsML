There was no immediate death toll for combatants . A spokesman for the U . N . refugee agency UNHCR in neighbouring Rwanda said that fighting erupted again in the area on Saturday . Relief workers in Bukavu said young Zairean men trucked in to reinforce troops there had not yet returned , suggesting fighting was continuing . Zaire is host to hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees who fled Rwanda fearing reprisals after the 1994 massacres of minority Tutsis by Hutu hardliners , or who fled ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Burundi . The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis , some of whom have lived in Zaire for generations . Zaire accuses the Tutsi - dominated army of Rwanda of training and arming Banyamulenge guerrillas to destabilise the region .

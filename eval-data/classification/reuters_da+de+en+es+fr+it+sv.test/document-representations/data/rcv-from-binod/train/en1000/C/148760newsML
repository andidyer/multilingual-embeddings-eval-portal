RTRS - Devex says plans share buy - back . Junior gold miner Devex Ltd said on Monday it planned a second share buy - back to distribute up to A $ 6 . 3 million capital to shareholders . Under the scheme , the company will make an off - market offer for a percentage of every shareholder ' s holding . Managing director Harry Adams said in a statement the buy - back reflected the company ' s strong balance sheet . An acceptance rate of 91 percent , as in the first offer , would leave Devex with cash and liquid assets of A $ 9 million after clearing all debts , he said . Devex , which operates the Gympie goldfield in Queensland , said earlier this month it had agreed to sell its 61 . 9 percent stake in industrial minerals and magnesia company Doral Minerals Industries Ltd for A $ 8 . 76 million . Devex bought back 9 . 4 percent of its issued capital in February at a cost of A $ 6 . 0 million . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 373 - 1800

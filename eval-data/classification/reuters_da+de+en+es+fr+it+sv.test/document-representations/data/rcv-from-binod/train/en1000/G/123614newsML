Majority white jury sworn in for Simpson civil trial . A jury with a majority of whites was sworn in on Thursday in the O . J . Simpson civil trial to decide if the former football star was responsible for the murders of his ex - wife and her friend . Following almost a month of questioning of more than 200 potential jurors , Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki seated the 12 - person panel , with whites making up the largest proportion . He told them opening arguments would begin next Tuesday . The jury consisted of seven white people , two blacks , one Hispanic and another of mixed white and Hispanic heritage and one born in Jamaica who is part Asian and part black . Seven are women and five men . The questioning continued later on Thursday as the judge sought to choose eight alternates who could take over if any of the jurors dropped out for health or other reasons . Simpson , who was acquitted by a predominantly black jury at a criminal trial last year of murdering his ex - wife , Nicole Brown , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , was in court on Thursday for the culmination of a process to choose the jury that will decide the case . He has been sued by the families of the victims and if found responsible for the murders could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages . The racial makeup of the jury could be crucial as opinion polls since the criminal trial have consistently showed an America divided over the verdict , with most blacks believing in Simpson ' s innocence and a majority of whites thinking he got away with murder . Simpson is black , the victims were white . The responses of potential jurors during questioning by lawyers for both sides tended to bear out this racial polarisation in attitudes . During Thursday ' s morning session , at which lawyers on both sides were allowed to make peremptory challenges against potential jurors , Simpson ' s team called for a mistrial charging the plaintiffs were targeting blacks to be excused from the panel . " They are systematically excluding African - American jurors and they ' re not permitted to do that , " said Robert Blasier , a member of Simpson ' s defence team . But Judge Fujisaki denied the oral motion , saying : " I find no basis on which to find the plaintiff has exercised challenges on the basis of race . "

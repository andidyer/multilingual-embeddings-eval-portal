Broker to start Internet trading system for munis . Bennett Mullaney & Co , a Warren , Vermont - based broker , said Friday it plans to start on February 10 an Internet trading system for municipal bonds for broker / dealers that will offer them sharply reduced rates . " The fees are approximately half of the fees currently being charged in the marketplace , " the firm said in prepared remarks . The company , a broker / dealer , specializes in municipal bonds , mostly those sold by Northeast issuers . The new auction system is designed solely for broker / dealers , who are promised anonymity . The trades will be cleared through National Financial Services Corp , part of Fidelity Investments . Bennett Mullaney said that the system ' s security will use dual passwords and is fully encrypted . Hollis Hunnewell , director of marketing , said that Bennett Mullaney is sending out over 500 user names and passwords to firms that have said they are willing to receive them . " The response we ' re getting back is , heck , if it works , great , " he said , noting there is no charge to sign up for the new system , called Bondauction . He added the firm decided to limit the new auction system to firms that are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers because it did not wish to compete for their customers by allowing either institutional or retail investors to use the system . " Broker / dealers are our clients and we didn ' t want to infringe on their business relationships . " No estimate of how much business the current 21 brokers ' brokers with whom the new system will compete now handle was immediately available . ( ( - - Joan Gralla , 212 - 859 - 1654 ) )

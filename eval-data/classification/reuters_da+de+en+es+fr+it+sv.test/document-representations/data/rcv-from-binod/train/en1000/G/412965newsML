Turkish press welcomes top council ' s warnings . Turkish newspapers on Saturday welcomed a set of decisions by a military - dominated council that has warned the Islamist - led government not to stray from official state secularism and democracy . " Historic decision , " flagged the mass - circulation daily Hurriyet in its banner headline , referring to the warnings by the influential National Security Council ( NSC ) after its nine - hour meeting that ended on Friday midnight . Liberal daily Milliyet ' s headline hailed the NSC decisions , saying : " Fine tuning for the regime . " It said the NSC had used strong expressions and included the word " sanctions " in its statement . " For the first time a warning for sanctions is given in NSC decisions unless the recommendations are heeded , " Milliyet said . The NSC said after the meeting in an unusually strongly - worded statement that Turkey ' s secular and democratic system could not be compromised for any alternative system . " Concessions must never be given on the applications of the republic ' s laws and constitution that guarantee the democratic system , " the statement said . The council - - chaired by President Suleyman Demirel and attended by Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , ministers and army generals - - met for nine hours until midnight on Friday . Its pronouncements traditionally reflect the will of the army . " The meeting decided to inform the cabinet of measures that need to be taken in respect to these issues , " the statement said . It did not elaborate on the measures . " All kinds of speculation that could harm Turkey ' s image and respect abroad and create doubts about its democracy . . . must be ended . Discussions about the regime cause damages for Turkey rather than benefits , " it said . " It is evaluated that actions against the aforementioned points will lead to new tensions and cause sanctions . " Strains have escalated since the army sent tanks on manoeuvres through Ankara ' s Sincan district early in February after an Islamist protest there attended by the Iranian ambassador . Erbakan , using similar expressions from the NSC statement , told his party meeting in Ankara on Saturday that all " declarations " that cast shadow on Turkey ' s democracy should be stopped to protect Turkish democracy . " It has been seen that all members of the NSC are in full agreement and it has been decided that all divisive and separatist activities causing unrest should be ceased , " he said . His government this week survived a censure motion challenge from two leftist parties that said the coalition was a threat to Turkey ' s secularism . Next week it will face another censure motion debate in parliament proposed by the opposition . Analysts said the military ' s displeasure at Erbakan ' s efforts to push ahead with Islam - based policies was not expected to result in anything like the three army interventions seen in Turkey since 1960 . Turks welcomed the warnings by the NSC . " I think this is a timely decision and the government had better heed it , " said Birol Sen , 28 , a storekeeper . Zeynep Halvasi , 20 , a musician , said : " We don ' t want military coups but this warning was needed . " The army is upset at comments in favour of sharia , or Islamic law , made by Islamists and by the Iranian ambassador at the anti - Israel protest in Sincan . But the small , leftist Freedom and Solidarity Party said in a statement that the NSC was not in a position to attempt to solve political problems of Turkey . " Enough is enough ! The NSC cannot do the fine - tuning of the regime , " it said .

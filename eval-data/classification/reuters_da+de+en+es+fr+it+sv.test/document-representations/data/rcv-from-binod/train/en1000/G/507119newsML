Liechtenstein govt faces first post - war opposition . The tiny Alpine principality of Liechtenstein got a new government on Monday that for the first time since 1938 faces an opposition in parliament , officials said . Parliament approved a four - year term for the new five - member government , which arose after the Progressive Citizens Party Liechtenstein ( FBPL ) voted last month to quit the ruling coalition headed by the Fatherland Union ( VU ) party , which now rules alone . The move brought down Europe ' s longest - serving ruling coalition , set up in 1938 amid fears of a Nazi German invasion . It was the same year Germany annexed neighbouring Austria . Mario Frick was reappointed head of government . Liechtenstein ' s hereditary ruler Prince Hans - Adam II , one of Europe ' s last monarchs to wield true power , presides over a territory of 160 square km ( 62 square miles ) with a population of just 30 , 000 . It borders Switzerland , with which it shares a customs union and the Swiss franc currency . A tax haven , it has lured thousands of lucrative anonymous " letterbox " holding companies and its per capita income is among the highest in the world . The decision to end the coalition followed general elections on February 2 , when the FBPL lost a parliamentary seat to the pro - ecology Free List party , leaving it only 10 seats in Liechtenstein ' s 25 - member parliament . The VU retained its 13 parliamentary seats . The latest changes will allow the FBPL to create its own party identity , a new challenge in a country where the two main parties had been virtually interchangeable .

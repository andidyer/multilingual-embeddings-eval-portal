UK ex - PM Major keeps posts open pending successor . John Major , outgoing leader of Britain ' s defeated Conservative party , will assume responsibility for foreign affairs and defence until his successor has appointed a new shadow cabinet . A statement from Major ' s office , issued after the first post - election meeting of the Conservative shadow cabinet , said the former prime minister did not believe it was appropriate to name new spokesmen now as it would tie his successor ' s hands . The Conservatives are left without spokesmen for forein affairs and defence because former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind and former defence secretary Michael Portillo failed to win re - election . Major , who announced his intention to step down soon after Labour ' s landslide victory last Thursday , said his priority was to see a new leader elected as soon as possible behind whom the party can unite . All present at the meeting agreed that whoever won - - six former ministers have put their names forward so far - - would have the united support of all the members of the shadow cabinet . - - London newsroom + 44 171 542 7767

UK shares outlook - Focus on Labour rate policy . The British stock market , having digested the Labour Party ' s awesome victory on Friday , faces its first test under the new government next week when UK monetary authorities meet with the market ' s sights trained on an imminent rate increase . The benchmark FTSE 100 scaled new peaks on Friday , drawing additional support from Wall Street where shares surged ahead early on , but the mood next week may turn more cautious , strategists and dealers said . Labour ' s newly - named chancellor Gordon Brown is set to meet with Bank of England Governor Eddie George for the first time next Wednesday to map out monetary policy . UK financial markets have been bracing themselves for weeks , if months , for an interest rate hike in the wake of the election . " There are a lot of hurdles in front of the market at the moment , " said Cory Miller , UK equity strategist with Credit Lyonnais Laing . " I think Labour will want to get the bad news out of the way early on . . . Eddie George has been pushing for a rate rise for a while now . " Short sterling interest rate futures on Friday were reflecting expectations for a 50 basis point interest rate hike , yet many strategists were predicting a rise only 25 basis points . " No rate rise or ( a rise of ) 50 basis points might cause the market to reassess , " said Peter Warburton , an economist with Robert Fleming Securities . " We ' ll have to see how much they tighten . A quarter of a point would be just a symbolic move . " " I don ' t think anyone is expecting no change in rates . The only point of disagreement is the amount by which they ' ll be raised , " one London dealer added . The market also has to contend with the possibility of further monetary tightening in the U . S . The Federal Open Market Committee , the policy - making arm of the Federal Reserve , will meet on May 20 . U . S . employment figures for April , released Friday afternoon , showed a smaller - than - expected 142 , 000 rise in new jobs , but a 0 . 3 percent decline in the unemployment rate . Though the figures boosted Wall Street , economists said they still leave the open the door for further tightening by the Fed . Yet the tallest hurdle in sight for UK shares is still at least two months away , when the Labour Party publishes its budget , strategists and dealers said . The budget , Labour ' s first in more than 18 years , could come as soon as late June . " The market will treat more favourably a bias toward fiscal tightening rather than monetary tightening , " said Robert Fleming ' s Warburton . Until Labour ' s policy becomes clear , dealers and strategists said they expected the market to trade defensively . " The bias will be toward large companies with secure revenue streams . I think that probably will be the theme for a while , " a dealer said . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5106

Daimler confident about China minivan deal . Daimler - Benz AG said Friday that it was confident its disagreements with the Chinese government over a proposed minivan plant can be resolved and the project will move forward . The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Daimler is threatening to abandon a $ 1 billion joint venture to build minivans in China because it wants to build a single plant , while its partner , state - run Nanfang South China Motor Corp . wants to build two . Since Daimler ' s Mercedes - Benz unit was chosen over Chrysler Corp and Ford Motor Co in 1995 for the project , China has changed certain conditions in the agreement , Daimler officials say . The Journal quoted Jurgen Hubbert , the Daimler - Benz board member who oversees world - wide passenger - car sales , as saying Mercedes would leave China if the issues could not be resolved . A Daimler spokesman said Friday , however , that " the project is not dead , " adding that the company had a lot of patience . Hubbert told Reuters Thursday that the negotiations with the Chinese have been difficult , but he wanted to see the outcome . " Before you can start ( production in China ) , you have to do a lot of discussions , " Hubbert said at Mercedes ' new U . S . assembly plant in Vance , Alabama . " The other side , in some cases , changes the conditions after having the contracts , so we should see at least what ' s coming out " of the talks .

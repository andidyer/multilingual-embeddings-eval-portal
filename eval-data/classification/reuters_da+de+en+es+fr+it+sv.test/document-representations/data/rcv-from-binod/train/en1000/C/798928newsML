Legal sparring won ' t derail Brazil cellular sale . The privatization of Brazil ' s cellular B Band frequency remains on track despite stepped - up legal attacks by investors vying for the most lucrative contracts , bank analysts said . With five auctions behind it , the Brazilian government should easily meet its goal of completing the sale of 10 B Band licenses by year ' s end , analysts said . " The process is well on track , " said Sergio Missima of Fator Securities . Although the winner of a major concession remains in doubt pending a court decision , the government was seen likely to sidestep this and other looming legal snags to push ahead with auctions expected to raise billions of dollars over the next several months . In the latest stumbling block , four consortia this week asked a high court to disqualify the Tess group , which on Friday won bidding for B Band area No . 2 covering non - metropolitan Sao Paulo state with an offer of 1 . 326 billion reais ( $ 1 . 2 billion ) . The groups asked the Superior Justice Tribunal ( STJ ) to quash an injunction that allowed Tess to take part in the B Band privatization program , while it reviewed its original disqualification in June . The STJ will likely rule on the consortia ' s request next week , analysts said . Such legal maneuverings have characterized the B Band sale since it began in June , with the Communication Ministry ' s disqualification of five bidders . All have appealed . In July , a sixth group , Telet S . A . , was disqualified from competiting for the large B Band areas and has waged a tough court battle to stay in the running . But the government was likely to move beyond these prickly legal fights for the time being and conclude the sale of the five remaining licenses in the next two to three months , analysts said . " The awarding of B Band concessions continues on schedule and should be completed by the end of 1997 with future auctions continuing monthly , " Sari Mayer of Salomon Brothers wrote in a report . Analysts also said latest court attack bedeviling the No . 2 area bid was strategic maneuvering by competing bidders , but are unlikely to delay the process and do not represent doubts about the transparency of the selloff process . Moreover , Brazil ' s need for a steady flow of cash into the country to finance its swelling current account deficit also should serve to push the B Band sale process along , despite the legal challenges , they said . " I don ' t expect any delays in the auctions , " said one telecom analyst at a local investment bank . " The government needs the capital flow and the legal problems can be taken care of later . The problem Tess had in this phase of the auction is irrelevent , " he added . Winning bids for the five B Band concessions auctioned off thus far totalled 5 . 11 billion reais ( $ 4 . 7 billion ) , including a mammoth 2 . 64 billion real offer for the Sao Paulo city concession , known as area No . 1 . Still to come are the auctions of areas three , four , five , six and eight , including the attractive concessions for Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo states , Minas Gerais states and Brazil ' s wealthy southern states . While the take should be less than for the first five , analysts said the government will easily exceed its goal of raising seven billion reais from the B Band sale .

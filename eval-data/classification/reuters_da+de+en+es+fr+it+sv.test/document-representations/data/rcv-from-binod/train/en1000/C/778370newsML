Amplats says not leasing platinum . South Africa ' s Anglo American Platinum Corp ( Amplats ) , the world ' s biggest platinum producer , said on Tuesday that it had not stockpiled the white metal to lend to take advantage of currently strong lease rates . " I wish we were ( lending ) . We are not holding platinum stocks and therefore are not able to take advantage of what would be a great opportunity , " Amplats commercial director Dorian Emmett said at a news conference . Precious metals markets have been underpinned by doubts about Russian PGM stockpiles and the country ' s ability to export . NYMEX October platinum ended Monday up $ 16 . 70 at $ 455 . 20 while the spot price finished New York dealings quoted at $ 456 . 00 / 459 . 00 an ounce . Platinum ' s one month lease rates were about 30 percent , one U . S . analyst said on Monday . Amplats managing director Barry Davison said the group was not considering any forward sales . " There ' s a backwardation in the market so the current spot price is higher than the current forward price . It ' s actually very difficult to deal in the forward markets at the moment . The amount of business you can do is very limited , " he said . " We do not believe that to deal into this backwardation is a terribly good idea . " Davison was bullish on the outlook for platinum prices . " We believe the fundamentals have changed in favour of platinum and therefore the longer - term outlook . . . for the next six to twelve months is just looking pretty good , " he said . He said that in the medium term the general trend of Russian sales of stockpiled platinum was deteriorating . " The sales that the Russians were able to put into the market of the last two or three years will not be sustained over the medium term and therefore the prospects must be brighter for firmer market conditions . " " We have no reason to dispute the general view that ( Russian sales ) will be between 20 and 25 tonnes for calendar 1997 , " he said . Russia sold about 40 tonnes of platinum in calendar 1996 . - - Justin McCamish , Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003E - mail , johannesburg . newsroom @ reuters . com

France ' s Credit Lyonnais bank shares rocket . Shares of French state - controlled bank Credit Lyonnais rocketed nearly 13 percent on Wednesday when investors piled in on hopes of a strong profit recovery this year . The shares , which make up around 20 percent of the bank ' s capital but carry no voting rights , closed up 35 . 50 francs ( $ 6 . 09 ) or 12 . 93 percent at 310 . 10 francs after setting a new year high of 317 . 10 francs earlier in the day . Volume totalled an unusually heavy 187 , 572 shares . The climb in the share price of Credit Lyonnais , which was brought to its knees in the early 1990s by an ill - fated expansion spree , came on top of a 6 . 50 percent gain on Tuesday . The robust performance has been driven by a report in business daily La Tribune this week quoting a source close to the bank as saying the group ' s 1997 profit could top more than two billion francs before a special penalty payment to the state under terms of a 1995 government rescue package . The bank has declined to comment on the article . Such earnings estimates have been in the market for several months and Credit Lyonnais Chairman Jean Peyrelevade predicted a 1997 net profit " in the billions " of francs earlier this year . But the article refocused attention on the bank ' s strong recovery , helped by cost cutting , attention to its core business and generous state aid under which its money - losing assets were hived off into a separate structure , analysts said . " Nobody now can disbelieve that the bank will turn in this kind of ( earnings ) performance , " said EIFB analyst Sami Gotrane , who forecast a profit of 2 . 3 billion francs before the penalty clause and around 1 . 5 billion afterward . The bank lost 21 billion francs between 1992 and 1994 before limping back into the black with a profit of 13 million francs in 1995 . It had a profit of 202 billion francs in 1996 . Several analysts said the shares could be due for profit taking and warned their value was vulnerable to political events . " This share is so leveraged to politics , it can swing either way , " said a Paris analyst who was neutral on the shares . The bank still has to submit a restructuring plan for the bank for approval to the European Commission which must clear all state aid . The bank needs the Commission ' s assent to neutralise the estimated 2 . 5 billion franc cost of a cheap loan it made to a state holding company to take over its bad assets . The shares have risen 138 percent since the start of the year . " It ' s well into a fair - value territory given its overall prospects and uncertainty about how it will be recapitalised , " said a London analyst . But others said the shares still had further to climb with a Paris analyst who had a buy recommendation on the shares setting an objective of 330 to 430 francs . He said the target would depend on terms of an expected state recapitalisation of the bank if it sells off its German banking arm BfG for a loss . The bank has been disposing of foreign subsidiaries to meet Commission approval for state aid . The analyst said he expected the state recapitalisation to be around 3 . 5 billion francs . Analysts were divided over prospects for sale of the bank in wake of last month ' s election victory by the Socialists . The previous conservative government had earmarked the bank for privatisation as early as this year . But the Socialists , who were in power during the period of the bank ' s lending excesses , have put all sell - offs on hold . One said he expected a sale to come in early 1998 . " My sense is that while some other privatisations have been pulled back for re - thinking , the government if only to avoid embarrassment will want to get out of it , " he said . But another said he believed now that the bank was making money , the state might want to hang on to it and gain the revenues from the profit penalty clause . " The state may say , ' Now that it is making a profit , why should we sell it , maybe we should use the money to compensate the taxpayer , ' " he suggested . Earlier this week , a conservative parliamentarian who was on the board of the state holding firm overseeing sale of the bank ' s bad assets , said losses from Credit Lyonnais ' misadventures would total 170 billion francs .

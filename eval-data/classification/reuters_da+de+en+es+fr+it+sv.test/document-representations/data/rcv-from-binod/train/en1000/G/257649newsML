Milosevic must accept opposition election win - US . A top U . S . envoy on the former Yugoslavia called on Sunday for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to recognise the opposition ' s win in local elections , saying it was " the price " for better relations with Washington . John Kornblum , an U . S . Assistant Secretary of State , also backed " democratic processes " in Serbia after more than two hours of talks with opposition leader Vuk Draskovic and other members of the Zajedno ( Together ) coalition . Draskovic , who heads the Serb Renewal Movement , said he was seeking diplomatic support from the United States and European Union . He accused Milosevic of provoking violence and civil war . " The Dayton agreement is in danger . Mr . Milosevic must be stopped , " Draskovic told reporters . " Mr . Milosevic must start to think in a democratic way first of all and recognise the election will of the people . " As they met in a Geneva hotel , a record 250 , 000 people marched through Belgrade in the 28th day of protests against alleged government election fraud last month . In an important move , a district court restored an opposition win in the town of Nis . Kornblum is in the Swiss city to attend a U . N . meeting on humanitarian issues on Monday and will also take part in a session later in the day of the Contact Group - Britain , France , Germany , Russia and the United States - on former Yugoslavia . " We believe it is now essential for Mr . Milosevic to accept the results of the election and open himself to continuing the democratic process with all democratic forces in the country and particularly to allow much greater freedom of the media , " the U . S . envoy told reporters . Freedom of the media was vital to national debate and to " make sure true democracy is built " , according to Kornblum . Kornblum noted that the Washington had not restored normal diplomatic or economic relations with Serbia and had maintained an " outer wall of sanctions " against Belgrade . " What we are saying now is as far as the United States is concerned , there is no normalisation with Serbia - - no trade , no investment - - which are all very important things . " Secondly , we will continue our support of the democratic processes there and expect that ( the same ) of Milosevic really as the price for any further movement in relations , " he added . Kornblum said : " Coming from the United States that is a very strong position which gives Milosevic a clear signal of our support for the democratic process . " He expressed satisfaction that Milosevic appeared to have agreed to accept a mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) to look into the situation . But Washington expected the OSCE team to have full access and be able to transmit its findings to the people of Serbia , according to the U . S . envoy , who arrived from Sarajevo . Vojin Dimitrijovic of the Civic Alliance and Ivan Vujacic of the Democratic Party also took part in the talks with Kornblum . " We need and we are expecting full support of both public opinion as well as the governments of the European Union and United States to help us to protect our election victory , " Draskovic said . " Mr . Milosevic robbed that victory . " " We stress the wish of the people of Serbia to establish a democratic system in our country , " he added . Draskovic said : " By annulling the election will of the people of Serbia , Mr . Milosevic is provoking vioence , bloodshed and even civil war in Serbia . " As far as sanctions are concerned , we have no bigger sanction than Milosevic . "

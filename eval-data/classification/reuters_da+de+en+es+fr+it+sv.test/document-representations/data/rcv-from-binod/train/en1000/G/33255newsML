OSCE declines to set new date for Bosnian polls . The man charged with organising Bosnia ' s post - war elections declined to be drawn on Tuesday over when cancelled municipal polls may be allowed to go ahead . Robert Frowick , head of an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) team which is organising the Bosnia elections under a UN mandate , said he could not say whether it would be a question of weeks or months . " We do not have a timeframe , " he told reporters after briefing NATO ' s 16 ambassadors on the current situation in Bosnia . Frowick cancelled the municipal polls two weeks ago due to vote - rigging tactics by Bosnian Serbs , but elections for regional and national assemblies and presidencies are still slated for September 14 . Under the Dayton peace accords , the elections have to go ahead to put unified democratic institutions in place and underpin the accords and allow NATO nations to withdraw their 60 , 000 - strong peace mission as scheduled by the end of 1996 . NATO Secretary - General Javier Solana said the alliance ' s peace force IFOR would retain sufficient strength to help with the organising of any polls , municipal or otherwise , until the end of the year . He said that if the polls had not been held by then , the position would have to be reconsidered . " The agreement is to maintain enough forces on the ground until the very end of the year , until the end of the mission . If municipal elections are postponed beyond that period of time , then that will be the moment to reconsider the decision , " Solana said . NATO sources stressed that did not mean an extension of the current one - year mandate would be necessary . Under current withdrawal plans , it could take more than three months for the troops in place to be brought out . Frowick admitted again the polls would be flawed , but said they would be " reasonably democratic . . . Balkan - style " . He said the country was at peace and no hostage - taking was occurring . Human rights groups say the poll will only give a thin veneer of democratic legitimacy to ethnic conquests won in battle .

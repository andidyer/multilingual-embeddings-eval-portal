Brazil blames trade again for current account gap . A doubling in Brazil ' s current account deficit in the first quarter of 1997 from the same period a year ago was fundamentally due to a burgeoning trade gap , a senior Central Bank official said . Altamir Lopes , head of the bank ' s economics department , told reporters the deficit in the current account of Brazil ' s balance of payments was $ 6 . 836 billion in the first three months of the year versus $ 3 . 43 billion in first quarter 1996 . " The deficit expanded quite a lot , basically due to the trade balance . The deficit in the services account grew too , but by a lot less , " Lopes said . Brazil ' s first quarter trade gap hit $ 3 . 1 billion . In 1996 , the trade deficit in the January to March period was $ 452 million . The services account in the first quarter of this year showed a deficit of $ 4 . 396 billion , up from $ 3 . 842 billion a year ago , the Central Bank said in a statement . The shortfall in international travel , which basically represents what Brazilians spend abroad , rose to $ 892 million from $ 662 million in the first quarter of 1996 , and net outflows of dividends and profits leapt to $ 1 . 348 billion from $ 379 million . A drop in net interest payments on external debt to $ 1 . 039 billion from $ 1 . 868 billion in January - March 1996 failed to plug much of the current account gap . The Central Bank only gave the relation of the current account to gross domestic product for the past 12 months , declining to give a figure for the first quarter specifically . Lopes said next month he would provide a Q1 figure . In the 12 months to March , the current account deficit represented 3 . 64 percent of GDP versus 3 . 25 percent for the whole of 1996 , a figure revised slightly downwards from the orginally announced 3 . 27 percent of GDP . Lopes said a third factor that continued to weigh on the balance of payments was a consistent decline in unilateral transfers from Brazilians living overseas , principally those of Japanese descent living in Japan . First quarter unilateral transfers were $ 618 million compared with $ 864 million a year before . Lopes said the drop was mainly due to the dollar ' s strength against the yen . Lopes noted that the current account deficit had been expanding steadily since last July , when it was equivalent to 2 . 01 percent over a 12 - month period . But he also noted the proportion of the gap being financed by long - term foreign direct investment had stabilized around 40 percent , having hit a peak of 58 percent in the first half of 1996 and reaching 42 . 4 percent in January - March 1997 .

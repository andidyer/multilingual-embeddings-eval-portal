N . J . mother recalls frantic search for dead daughter . Maureen Kanka wept softly on Monday as she described the last day of her daughter ' s life at the start of the trial of a notorious rape and murder case . Testifying as the first witness in the trial of Jesse Timmendequas for the rape and murder of 7 - year - old Megan Kanka in July 1994 , she described an increasingly frantic search for her daughter . " We were looking everywhere . We were looking in dumpsters , " Kanka said on the opening day of what is expected to be a six - week trial . In her opening statement , First Assistant Prosecutor Kathryn Flicker said Timmendequas had confessed to enticing Megan to his house to see a puppy . Once the little girl was inside , he raped and strangled her . The 35 - year - old defendant , a twice - convicted sex offender , lived across the street from the Kanka family in Hamilton Township , a suburb of Trenton . The crime touched off a public outcry , led by Maureen and Richard Kanka , who said they hadn ' t known their neighbour was a twice - convicted sex offender . Megan ' s Law , a result of their campaigning , requires offenders to register and empowers authorities to notify the public about those they regard pose the highest risk . Flicker said in her opening statement that Timmendequas had told police where to find the girl ' s body in a park , and she was found " exactly where he said she would be . " She said evidence including clothing found in his house together with his statements would point to his guilt . Flicker said Megan tried to scream and fight her way out of the accused man ' s house after the rape . Laying the ground for seeking the death penalty , the prosecutor said , " He meant to kill . He chose to kill , " she told the jury . Public Defender Barbara Lependorf asked the jury not to let emotions cloud their consideration of the evidence . Judge Andrew Smithson has limited courtroom television to opening and closing arguments , and to the verdict . Even photographers will be limited to pool coverage , rotating between three state newspapers . The jury of 12 and four alternates comes from neighbouring Hunterdon County . It was selected in Flemington , blocks from the old courthouse where Bruno Hauptmann was tried for the Lindbergh kidnap - murder 62 years ago . The selection process was laborious and took nearly three months . A complicating factor was the notoriety of the case and the new state laws it generated .

UK Liberal boss sees tie with Labour possible . The leader of Britain ' s minority Liberal Democrats , who could hold the balance of power after elections next year , said on Monday a centre - left coalition with the Labour party was possible but unlikely . " All options are open , " Paddy Ashdown told BBC radio in the southern resort of Brighton where his party is holding its pre - election annual conference . Opinion polls give Labour , led by Tony Blair , a better - than - ever chance of ousting the ruling Conservatives of Prime Minister John Major in a general election which must be held by next May . Speculation was rife at the Liberals ' conference about the possibility of an Ashdown - Blair alliance which could produce the first two - party government in Britain since World war Two if Labour failed to win an overall majority at the election . Ashdown ' s venture into controversial conjecture about a post - election deal was prompted by a surprise intervention on the issue from one of his 25 members of parliament on Sunday . Alex Carlile said he could see the day when Labour and the Liberals might merge to form a centre - left party to confront the Conservatives , and urged Ashdown to take a cabinet seat if Blair offered him one . Ashdown was asked by a BBC interviewer whether he accepted this suggestion . " Nothing is ruled in , nothing is ruled out , " he replied . " Is it possible we will do what you suggest ? Yes . Is it likely viewed from the moment ? No . " Blair has moved Labour away from many of its old socialist stances , winning converts who have given it a 20 point lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls . His success has also trimmed support for the Liberals , who currently stand at about 14 percent in the polls . However , impressive successes in local government ballots since the 1992 general election have raised Liberal optimism . Labour ' s lead would have to narrow dramatically and the Liberal showing improve before a hung parliament , in which no party holds an overall majority , became a likelihood . Labour ' s chief parliamentary business manager , asked by BBC radio about Ashdown ' s musings on the possibility of coalition , said : " We will cross that bridge if we come to it . We don ' t anticipate being in that situation . " Ashdown praised Blair for changing some of his party ' s policies , but said the transformation was far from complete . " Mr Blair is moving his party on to our ground , using our language . The more he does that , the more he validates our programme , but they have a long , long , long way to go . " An opinion poll commissioned by the Daily Mirror newspaper showed on Monday that more a third of Britons would like to see a Liberal - Labour coalition if Labour did not win an overall majority in parliament . Another 25 percent favoured the two parties agreeing a programme of legislation without Liberals actually entering the government .

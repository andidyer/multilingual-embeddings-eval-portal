Venezuelans offered chance to invest in oil sector . The Venezuelan public is being offered for the first time a bite at the oil sector ' s pie with the auction of 20 marginal fields , the government said Friday . State company Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) kicked off a third round of field auctions with these 20 fields expected to yield up to 300 , 000 barrels per day within 10 years . The auction is expected to culminate in May 1997 . For the first time since the oil sector was nationalized 20 years ago , Venezuelans will be able to invest in the schemes through a newly - created investment fund and PDVSA subsidiary , the Oil Investment Promotion Fund ( SOFIP ) . The fund will be allowed to participate in 10 percent of each area , PDVSA Vice - President Claus Graf told a news conference . He added that " it is expected to be floated on the Caracas Stock Exchange and possibly internationally , within 12 months of the conclusion of the round . " Stressing the importance of the measure , Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta called it " an opening towards the domestic side and a key to open . . . the country ' s main industry . " Graf also said a quarter of the 20 new areas were reserved for Venezuelan investors , with some advantages because they required less investment than the others and had a higher crude potential . PDVSA is planning a series of roadshows to explain the schemes , in Caracas on November 22 , Houston on November 25 and London on November 29 . Companies will have until December 20 to formally ask for pre - qualification . - - Omar Lugo , Caracas newsroom , 582 505 2600

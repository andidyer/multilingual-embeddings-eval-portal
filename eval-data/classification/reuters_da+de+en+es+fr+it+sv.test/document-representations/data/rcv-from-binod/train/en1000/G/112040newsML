Five people die in attacks on Indonesian churches . Five people died when a mob burned nine churches , four Christian schools and a convent in the Indonesian town of Situbondo , a policeman in the town said on Friday . " It is true the churches were burnt " on Thursday , the policeman told Reuters by telephone from the town on Java island 800 km ( 500 miles ) east of the capital Jakarta . " The five died inside a church , " he said before the phone was cut off . He said the crowd also destroyed a court building and cars and caused other damage during the violence around 1 p . m . on Thursday . Indonesia ' s nearly 200 million population on the archipelago of 17 , 500 islands is more than 85 percent Moslem , but the state ideology preaches religious tolerance and recognises the five main religions . Situbondo is about 160 km ( 100 miles ) east of Indonesia ' s second city , Surabaya , where a number of attacks on churches were reported in June . The reason for these attacks was not clear . The policeman said it was yet known what had caused the Situbondo riot or whether it had been organised . A number of people had been detained and investigations were continuing , he added . A Surabaya - based journalist who went to Situbondo said the riot apparently broke out after a hearing in the court into a case of alleged blasphemy against Islam . He said several thousand people outside the court during the third hearing into the case called for the accused to be sentenced immediately or handed over to the crowd . He said another church was burnt in the neighbouring town of Panarukan . A hall being used by Roman Catholics as a church in a village in east Jakarta was burned down in mid - September . Catholics in the area attributed the attack to religious antagonism towards their presence .

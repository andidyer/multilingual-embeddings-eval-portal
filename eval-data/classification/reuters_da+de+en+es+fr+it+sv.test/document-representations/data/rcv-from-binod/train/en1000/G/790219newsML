INDIA CONGRESS CHIEF VOWS TO WIN ELECTIONS . Congress party president Sitaram Kesri pledged on Sunday to deliver victory at India ' s next general election and urged the party ' s workers to close ranks and strengthen the organisation . Congress , which has ruled India for all but five of the 50 years since independence , finished a humiliating second in a general election last year but it provides make - or - break backing to Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral ' s 15 - party coalition . " You discipline yourselves , give me your support , I will give you power in Delhi , " Kesri said in a closing address at the party ' s plenary session . " You will give us the strength to march towards Delhi and unfurl the national flag at Red Fort . " The historic Red Fort is the traditional venue where the nation ' s prime minister unfurls the national flag on Independence Day ( August 15 ) . The Congress chief has repeatedly vowed during the three - day meeting to lead the party back into power . Kesri said he did not want to grab power by dislodging the present government . " My eyes are on Delhi but not by removing this government but through people ' s mandate , " he told Reuters after giving a general media briefing . Kesri ignited a political crisis in March when he abruptly withdrew support for the then prime minister , H . D . Deve Gowda , who was later toppled in a parliamentary vote of confidence . The centre - left United Front then turned to Gujral , who has since enjoyed Congress ' support but has been undermined by tensions within his own party and coalition . Kesri said the coalition government was unable to provide stability and fulfill the aspirations of the people . He predicted an early election but ruled it out in the immediate future . A government can remain in office for up to five years . " I am ready and I have started my preparations . But I must also say elections are not going to come soon , " he earlier told the briefing . Kesri , who was re - elected as party president in June , promised to tour all the states with an eye on the polls . He said Congress must be on its guard and fight the right - wing Hindu opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and left - wing parties . " Be cautious aginst these forces . We have to fight against the BJP and the left , " Kesri said . BJP , the main opposition , is the single largest party in parliament . Kesri rebutted allegations of corruption against Congress , saying the party never spared the corrupt . " Congress is more honest than other parties , cleaner than others . " The indictment of many party leaders in corruption scandals put paid to party ' s bid for power at the last general election . More than half a dozen ministers of the 112 - year - old Congress , once synonymous with the freedom movement , resigned after being charged in a money - laundering scandal . Kesri appeared to have crossed a major hurdle on Saturday when seven of his supporters were leading in an election to the party ' s elite decision - making body , the Congress Working Committee ( CWC ) . The CWC has 20 members , of which 10 are elected and the rest nominated by the party chief .

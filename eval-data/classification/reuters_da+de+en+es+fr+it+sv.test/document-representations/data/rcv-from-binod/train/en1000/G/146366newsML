Jews demand inquiry into Paris wartime seizures . The French Jewish community asked the Paris city council on Sunday to investigate whether some of the apartments the city acquired during World War Two were seized from Jews deported to Nazi death camps . The Jewish community council CRIF demanded a detailed report " on possible despoilment of Paris Jewish families under the collaborationist Vichy regime , and on compensation to them " . It demanded that " all light be shed " after a book revived historians ' long - standing suspicions that some of the city property was seized from Jews who never returned after the war . The opposition Socialists were also expected to request on Monday that a committee including members of the Jewish community be set up to investigate the history of city property . Some 75 , 000 Jews were deported from France to death camps . " Private Estate " , recently published by journalist Brigitte Vital - Durand , coincided with the Paris city council selling off part of its real estate following a political scandal . Deputy mayor Jean - Francois Legaret said none of the blocks sold so far or up for sale had belonged to Jewish families . CRIF said Legaret ' s statement made it clear that " the Paris city council is able to establish the history of each property and therefore its possible previous ownership by Jewish families " . Vital - Durand , studying an area of the capital ' s mediaeval Marais central district where part of the Jewish community still lives , said its population had dropped from 25 , 000 to 5 , 000 during the war as Jewish families were deported or fled and hundreds of buildings were destroyed for urban renovation . She wrote the Paris city council now owns 150 buildings in the area , some of which had belonged to Jews , and some property was sold without its history being disclosed . Paris mayor Jean Tiberi has ordered the sale of a third of the 1 , 389 apartments the city has purchased or acquired over the centuries through donations and expropriations . The sale followed a scandal over disclosures that the city council was leasing flats well below market prices to political cronies and notables , including Prime Minister Alain Juppe and relatives .

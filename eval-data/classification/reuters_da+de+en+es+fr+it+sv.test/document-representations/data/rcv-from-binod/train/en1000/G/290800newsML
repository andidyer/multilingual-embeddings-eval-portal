Two reporters enter Peru siege building . Two reporters on Tuesday entered the besieged Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima , where Marxist rebels were holding 74 hostages . It was not immediately clear why the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels allowed the journalists into the building . Live television showed the reporters , whom witnesses said worked for the Japanese television station Asahi TV , apparently talking on the steps of the residence with people inside before entering . As he approached the building , one of the journalists held above his head a green placard with writing on it , but witnesses could not discern what it said . Journalists have entered the building once before since the crisis began 21 days ago . On Dec . 31 , the rebels allowed in about 20 journalists to interview them and hostages . That meeting followed an agreement brokered by the Red Cross between the government and the MRTA permitting the media to approach the residence to film it close - up . It was believed the accord did not include the journalists entering the building .

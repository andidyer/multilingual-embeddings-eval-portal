SIMEX Euroyen firm , JGBs surge on share losses . SIMEX Euroyen futures firmed slightly while Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures made strong gains following heavy losses in Tokyo stocks on Monday . Dealers said the market was underpinned by the perception Japan would maintain its low interest rate regime following the Nikkei share average ' s 600 - point drop and a restaurant chain ' s announcement it was effectively bankrupt . But a trader with a European house said JGB gains were slowed by fears Japanese life insurers would sell their bond holdings to cover stock losses . On Friday , a Japanese newspaper quoted the chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan , Kenjiro Hata , as saying some life insurers might sell domestic and foreign bonds and stocks if Tokyo stock prices did not recover . " That was at the back of people ' s minds and it took the edge off the JGBs , " the trader said , noting that March JGBs had trouble reaching the 126 . 41 resistance level . They settled at 126 . 25 against their opening 125 . 62 . September Euroyen was quoted at 99 . 32 at 1125 GMT against their IMM close at 99 . 29 . Eurodollar futures finished little changed in thin trade due to a U . S . holiday for Martin Luther King Day . March Eurodollars ended at 94 . 38 , unchanged from their IMM close , on turnover of 4 , 000 lots . - - Sonali Desai ( 65 - 8703090 )

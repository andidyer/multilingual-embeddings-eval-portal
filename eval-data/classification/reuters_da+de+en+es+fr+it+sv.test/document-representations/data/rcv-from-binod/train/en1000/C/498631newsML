Aker RGI buys large stake in Storebrand . Norwegian industrial holding company Aker RGI ASA has bought around 24 million shares in Norway ' s largest insurer Storebrand ASA , according to a statement on the Oslo bourse on Wednesday . Two million of the shares are ordinary stock , the statement said . This puts Aker RGI ' s stake in Storebrand at six percent of the total capital , Frode Geitvik , Aker RGI spokesman , told Reuters . Storebrand announced last week that it planned to merge with Norway ' s second largest commercial bank Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse ASA to form the country ' s largest financial group and the sixth biggest in the Nordic region . Since then Norwegian billionaire entrepreneur Kjell Inge Roekke , the largest shareholder in Aker RGI , has increased his personal stake in Storebrand to 10 percent . Geitvik declined to say if Aker RGI ' s acquisition was a financial or strategic investment . " It is not so that we are not interested in the formation of the financial structure in Norway . It is naturally of significance to us . I must remind you that Aker earlier has been heavily positioned in Storebrand , " he told Reuters . Daily newspaper Verdens Gang said Roekke , Aker RGI and Roekke ' s close ally Jens Heyerdahl in Norwegian food - based conglomerate Orkla together control 26 percent in Storebrand , which means they have the power to block the merger if they want to . Storebrand ' s chairman Jon Gundersen has previously said that Aker RGI and Roekke should be considered as one shareholder , and therefore , under Norwegian regulations , should declare any shareholding over 10 percent . Geitvik rejected this . " Gundersen ' s reflections are his own opinion , " the spokesman said . He added that Aker RGI had not take a position as to whether they supported the Storebrand / Christiania Bank merger or not . - - Oslo newsroom , + 47 22 42 50 41

Serbian opposition calls for Milosevic to quit . Serbian opposition leaders , keeping up a wave of street protests , said on Wednesday President Slobodan Milosevic should quit power after refusing to concede defeat in local elections . " Until yesterday we fought to protect our election victory , but now the goal of our rebellion is the resignation of Slobodan Milosevic , " Vuk Draskovic , one of the opposition leaders , told a crowd in the city centre . The opposition coalition Zajedno ( Together ) has led more than a week of demonstrations in the capital and towns across the country after authorities annulled results of a municipal poll which went badly for Milosevic ' s ruling Socialists . " Every day we are pulling a brick from his ( Milosevic ' s ) Chinese Wall , " Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic said from a window in his fourth - floor headquarters . Djindjic led Wednesday ' s column estimated between 50 , 000 to 80 , 000 through the city centre . The biggest protests since 1991 have turned into a referendum on Milosevic , who has dominated Serbia with an iron hand for nine years . Marchers retraced the route that similar protests have taken each day since local electoral commissions and courts cancelled opposition victories in run - off local elections on November 17 . Chanting " red bandits " , demonstrators focused their anger on state television and state newspaper offices - - symbols of Milosevic ' s authoritarian rule . The crowd smashed some windows in both buildings , where opposition supporters had earlier used only eggs and paint bombs to deface the walls . Later Djindjic appealed for restraint , and called on his followers to maintain the pressure on Milosevic . " Do not break windows , do not throw stones . What we want is victory through the will of the people , " he told the crowd . " We will be here every day until the chains break , until the ice melts . Serbia is being defended here . " State televison , under Milosevic ' s strict control , heaped scorn on the protesters and portrayed them as an anarchic mob . Showing footage of broken windows , a television presenter said : " These are only some of the consequences of their vandalism in the name of democracy . " The opposition has claimed victory in 15 of Serbia ' s 18 largest towns , including Belgrade , but authorites annulled the results in most towns , citing unspecified irregularities . A supreme court challenge by Zajedno failed to overturn the annulments on Tuesday , but the opposition then declared it would continue its struggle to have the victories recognised . Socialist authorities organised another round of voting on Wednesday in municipalities where the opposition claimed victories . The opposition called for a boycott in Belgrade of the re - vote , which it described as a " farce " . Djindjic said the protests showed ordinary people were fed up with Milosevic ' s authoritarian rule and were eager for democratic reforms that have swept across Eastern Europe . The crowd also defied the city electoral commission which earlier ruled that the demonstrations were banned under a law which prohibits campaigning in the last two days before voting , and on polling day itself . In Nis and Kragujevac , industrial centres once considered loyal to Milosevic , similar protests took place on Wednesday .

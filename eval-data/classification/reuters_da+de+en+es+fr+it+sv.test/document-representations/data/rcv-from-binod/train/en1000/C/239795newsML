COCOA - Brazil chocolate production to keep growing . Brazil ' s chocolate production is set to keep growing with this year ' s output expected to show an increase of eight percent over 1995 and a further rise predicted for next year . Brazil , where Nestle , Garoto and Lacta dominate the chocolate manufacturing market , is expected to produce 308 , 000 tonnes in 1996 , according to the Brazilian Association of Chocolate , Cocoa , Sweets and Derivatives ( Abicab ) . Abicab ' s Dirceo Campera said the figure , which compared to a total of 293 , 700 tonnes for 1995 , was a pleasant surprise as an increase of only two to three percent had been expected at the start of 1996 . Production was expected to continue on the increase next year , Campera said . " The Easter period will be decisive but at the moment , we ' re working on a prediction of an increase of around six percent , " he said . This would mean output of around 327 , 000 tonnes . " The Brazilian chocolate industry is in a very healthy position as it is in the hands of three very well - run companies who are constantly investing to increase production , " Campora said . Output has shown a startling increase since 1990 , when 186 , 000 tonnes was produced . Apart from a drop in production in 1992 , it has risen steadily , the best results coming in 1994 , the year of an anti - inflationary plan which finally produced economic stability in Brazil following years of hyper - inflation . Production in 1994 was 251 , 000 tonnes , up from 220 , 000 tonnes the year before . The growing chocolate consumption amongst Brazilians has also resulted in the import of chocolate . At the same time , however , local production of cocoa , which is grown chiefly in the state of Bahia , has dropped almost as quickly as chocolate production has risen . Until around 1990 , Brazil traditionally produced cocoa crops of around 6 . 0 million 60 - kilo bags , around 360 , 000 tonnes . The 1996 / 7 crop year which finished in April , however , is expected to produce less than 3 . 0 million bags . The current main crop , harvested from October to April , was badly hit by a two - month drought during June and July and is not expected to produce more than one million bags . Producers said that rainfall has returned to normal in the last month but that the benefits will only be felt in the next midcrop , which is harvested from May to September . Internal prices for beans remained at around 20 Real per 15 - kilo arroba this week , producers said .

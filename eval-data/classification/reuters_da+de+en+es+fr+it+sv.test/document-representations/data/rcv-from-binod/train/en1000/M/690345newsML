Israeli shares close lower in thin trading . Israeli shares closed lower on Thursday for the third consecutive session on low volume as political uncertainty and the sharp decline of the shekel depressed prices , traders said . The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares ended down 0 . 87 percent , or 2 . 52 points , to 285 . 50 on low all - share turnover of 150 million shekels against 170 million shekels on Wednesday . The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0 . 90 percent lower at 293 . 02 . " There is much political and economic uncertainty and this is bad for the market . The latest events indicate that the government may not last much longer , " said Arik Rotstein of Bloch Rotstein Securities and Investments . " The rapid decline of the shekel is only adding to investor uncertainty . " Israeli President Ezer Weizman urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ' s cabinet on Thursday to stop squabbling and get back to work on Middle East peace - making . Two ministers have quit in anger . Others have refused to speak to Netanyahu and boycotted cabinet meetings while several coalition members abandoned him in a parliamentary no - confidence vote this week . The shekel has fallen sharply since last Friday , shortly after the government announced a reform of the exchange rate regime and the Bank of Israel lowered the base rate by a steep 1 . 2 percentage points to 12 . 7 percent . But Rotstein said a sharp decline of the shekel might lead to higher inflation and even to a decision of the Bank of Israel to raise its key lending rate . " If the devaluation of the shekel continues this will have an immediate impact on the results of companies that took foreign currency loans , " Rotstein said . Danni Scharia of Capital Securities said the Bank of Israel must intervene in the forex market . " If he doesn ' t stop the shekel ' s fall it could snowball , " he said . " It will also worsen the condition of many companies , which are about the publish their results . " Rotstein said the recent decline of the market could also be seen as a technical correction . " The fact that activity is also falling supports the feeling that this is only a correction . I believe that the Mishtanim will stop at around 270 points and the Maof at 280 , " he said . Scharia agreed and is more optimistic about the Maof ' s floor . " The slide will stop once the Maof reaches 290 points . We haven ' t seen such low activity for a long time and that ' s a clear indicator that it ' s only a correction , " he said .

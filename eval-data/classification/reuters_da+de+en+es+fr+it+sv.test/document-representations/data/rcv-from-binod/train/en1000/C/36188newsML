Canadian cargo consortium to court freight forward . A Canadian cargo consortium plans to meet with freight firms next week to try to entice them to use this city ' s airport as an intercontinental shipping hub , the consortium ' s president told Reuters . " There are 20 or 25 freight forwarders in the world that are big players , all companies that do US $ 1 billion a year . That ' s our target . We ' ll be meeting with them starting next week in North America , then in Asia and Europe later in October to obtain letters of commitment , " Winnport Logistics Ltd president Lynn Bishop said in a telephone interview . The consortium expects to fly twice weekly to the United Kingdom and Germany , with one extension to Bombay , India each week , as well as two weekly flights to South Korea and three weekly flights to Japan , Bishop said . The firm had been in talks with Air Canada to lease two 747 - 100 cargo freighters , but is now in negotiations with an undisclosed airline for a similar arrangement and a deal is expected in the coming weeks , he said . " What we want to do is offer a very attractive rate to freight forwarders and they ' d be given guaranteed positions on the airplanes under a longer term contract , " Bishop said . The consortium is promoting Winnipeg , located near the geographical center of North America with 18 , 000 acres of undeveloped land bordering the airport , as advantages to developing an air , rail and truck shipping hub here . " We ' re looking at shipping goods that may not be too time sensitive and because of that they can seek a lower rate , which is what we propose to offer , " Bishop said . Goods would include consumer electronics , car parts , pharmaceuticals , textiles from India as well as chilled pork and beef for Asian markets , he said . Winnport will meet with Emery Worldwide , among others . Canada ' s federal government plans to upgrade its border crossing at Emerson , Manitoba , which leads south through Kansas City and Dallas to Monterrey , Mexico , and east to Minneapolis and Chicago . Five hundred commercial trucks transit that single border crossing every day . Canada Customs officials are already testing transponders that identify a truck ' s contents and the status of its operator directly to a computer . Letters of commitment , a lease agreement on the 747s and operating licenses must be in place by mid - December , he said . If everything was in order by then , the consortium expected to begin operating on May 1 , 1997 , he said . Winnport Logistics includes Air Canada , Canadian National Railway Co , CP Rail System , Winnipeg International Airport , Kleysen Transport , Matrix Freight Services Ltd , Reimer Express World Corp , James Richardson & Sons Ltd and Bank of Montreal . - - Reuters Winnipeg bureau 204 947 3548

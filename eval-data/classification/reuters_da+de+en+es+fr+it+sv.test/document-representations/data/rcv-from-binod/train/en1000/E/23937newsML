FORECAST - S . Africa August reserves to dip again . South Africa ' s foreign reserves will probably fall again in August , but the tide may be turning with a steadier rand since mid - month starting to boost inflows , economists said on Friday . Official gold and foreign exchange reserves , due next Friday , are seen falling to 10 . 1 billion rand in August from 10 . 37 billion in July , according to a consensus forecast of economists polled by Reuters . " I think reserves during the month will have fallen below 10 billion rand but they have probably since pulled back slightly , " said Dennis Dykes , chief econimist at Nedcor bank . " We ' ve seen an improvement in the last part of the month . " Low reserves have been a focus for speculators selling rand in the belief the central Reserve Bank is running out of ammunition to defend the currency . But in the last two weeks the rand has gained 10 cents from its all - time low of 4 . 59 against the dollar , forcing speculators long of dollars and short of rands to cut their positions . The currency was trading at its best level in three weeks on Friday . Economists and foreign exchange dealers said there had been sizeable inflows this week from gold producers and other exporters seeking to convert overseas proceeds into rand . By the end of July , which saw a decline of 0 . 9 billion rand , reserves represented just 1 . 1 months import cover . The Reserve Bank also has some 15 billion rand in foreign credit lines which Governor Chris Stals said again this week he would use , if necessary , to provide liquidity for importers . Herman van Papendorp , economist at SMK Securities , said net foreign sales of bonds and shares early in August would weigh on the reserve figure . This would be only partially offset by a better rand gold price , boosting the gold element . But the position could improve from next month . " Looking forward to September , I would guess the reserves situation will have stabilised and you may well see foreigners coming back into the market , " he said . Economists said encouraging trade and money supply data this week had boosted market sentiment , reassuring investors and easing pressure for an imminent Bank rate hike . " It ' s been a good week , there is no question about it , " said Nedcor ' s Dykes . A sharp fall in the average three - month Treasury bill rate at Friday ' s auction to below Bank rate of 16 percent also soothed market nerves . The average rate fell to 15 . 79 percent from 16 . 09 last week , as the central bank maintained a tight rein on supply with offers held at 600 million rand against the usual 900 million . Stals made clear in his address to the Reserve Bank ' s annual meeting on Tuesday that he did not believe an interest rate increase was needed at present , although the situation remained finely balanced . Since then things have been gone his way with a surge in the July trade surplus to 2 . 58 billion rand and a fall in M3 growth easing Stals ' two top concerns - - the current account deficit and ballooning money supply . Analysts noted the daily money market shortage remained very high at over nine billion rand , but said the situation should improve next week as the market put the traditional month - end squeeze behind it . - - Johannesburg newsroom + 27 11 482 1003

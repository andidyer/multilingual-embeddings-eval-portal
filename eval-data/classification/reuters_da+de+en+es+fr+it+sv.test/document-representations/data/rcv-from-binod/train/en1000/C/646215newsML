Serono unit challenges FDA . Serono Laboratories Inc , a unit of Ares - Serono SA , said Monday it is challenging in federal court a recent U . S . Food and Drug Administration decision to allow the marketing of a generic urine - based infertility therapy without , it alleged , appropriate and required product testing . Serono said it is bringing suit to overturn the FDA ' s approval of privately - held Ferring Group ' s menotropins product as a violation of the law . It also asks the Court to enjoin FDA from approving any new drug application for a generic menotropins product unless and until it can be conclusively demonstrated that such product contains the same active and inactive ingredients and composition as the reference listed drug it seeks to copy . Serono contends that FDA considered its injectable infertility hormone , Pergonal , a menotropin for injection , as the " innovator " drug product when approving the Ferring drug , even though the FDA acknowledged in previous documents that the active and inactive ingredients in Pergonal are different from the ingredients in the menotropins product . The Ares - Serono Group is a Swiss developer and marketer of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of infertility , growth , wasting and immunology / oncology .

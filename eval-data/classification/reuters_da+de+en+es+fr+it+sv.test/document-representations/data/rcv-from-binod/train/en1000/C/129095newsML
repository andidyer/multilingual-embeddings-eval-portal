RTRS - ACCC clears IAMA bid for Primac . The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) will not oppose the proposed acquisition of Primac Holdings Ltd by IAMA Ltd , acting ACCC chairman Allan Asher said on Sunday . The ACCC found the rural merchandise market in which both companies are involved appeared to be competitive in the relevant markets of Queensland and northern New South Wales , he said in a statement . IAMA is offering nine of its shares for every 10 Primac shares . Primac last week recommended shareholders take no action on the bid pending further advice . It said that IAMA ' s Part A offer document had major deficiences which made it impossible for shareholders to make a sensible investment decision . - - Sydney newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

RTRS - Pasminco links profit to commodities . Metals group Pasminco Ltd said on Monday that its earnings in 1996 / 97 will continue to be influenced by the outlook for the world economy and its impact on commodity prices . " There seems some prospect of modest improvement , particularly in the second half of the financial year , in Japan and Germany , " Pasminco said in its 1995 / 96 annual report . Despite some strength in other base metals , the price of Pasminco ' s key metal , zinc , continues to languish , the company said . The lead price , on the other hand , remains stronger , it said . Loss of some investor confidence due to uncertainties in the London Metal Exchange copper market , has spilled over to other base metals , inluding lead and zinc , the report said . However , the impact of this disruption appears to have moderated , the company said . It said the company ' s success lies in its ability to withstand prolonged troughs in metals prices that occur at times . Pasminco said it was close to meeting its objective of reducing costs by 15 percent , as measured by its break even zinc price . The break even price was reduced by 10 percent to US $ 900 . 00 a tonne in 1995 / 96 , it said . The company also said that it not yet received an extension by the Dutch government to store hazardous jarosite waste at its Budel zinc smelter , despite indications of government support . Long - term operation of the Dutch smelter hinges on an extension to compensate for delays of at least a year in bringing the jaorsite - free Century zinc mine in Queensland on stream . The mine project has been delayed by aboriginal native title land disputes involving the mine site . Although debt was up last year , the company ' s balance sheet is sound and its gearing ratio conservative , the report said . - - Sydney newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

Dutch closing share market report . Dutch shares closed lower on Tuesday , giving up early gains which pushed the AEX share index past the 790 for the first time , responding to a lower opening on Wall Street after the U . S . market ' s record high on Monday . Early buying in the wake of Wall Street ' s 1 . 72 percent Monday night surge sent the AEX to an all time high of 792 . 71 , beating Monday ' s record closing and intra - day high of 788 . 08 . But Wall Street ' s decline on profit - taking dragged the index back in the last hour or so of Amsterdam business , leaving the AEX off 2 . 05 points to 786 . 03 . " It ' s been disappointing today , the market ' s starting to hesitate a little , " said a dealer . Dealers said U . S . April retail sales figures announced earlier had little direct impact on the Amsterdam market , although investors were beginning to be concerned about the impact of other data expected this week . This week also sees the release of U . S . producer and consumer price data and jobless claims information . " People are thinking that a small correction could be seen after the figures , given that the market has gone up so far so quickly , " a dealer said , referring to the record - breaking runs both here and on Wall Street . The AEX share index has risen around 11 percent since mid - April . Dealers said the Amsterdam market had been shaping up to make an assault on the 800 level but that this might have to go on the back burner for a while as the New York market looked like it might be ready to stall after its run . " When we came in this morning 800 looked possible - - it was only 12 points off from Monday ' s close and after the Wall Street gain it looked within reach , " said a dealer . " But it looks like there ' s no real buying pressure around at the moment and people don ' t really want to push the market , " he said , adding that the market ' s hesitation had attracted some light profit - taking ahead of Friday ' s options expiries . Hunter Douglas outpaced the general market decline , falling 8 . 00 guilders or 4 . 5 percent to 174 . 00 despite announcing a 20 percent first quarter rise in net profit to 30 . 3 million guilders and reiterating a positive outlook for the year . The window coverings and architectural products company was announcing quarterly figures for the first time and analysts had not put together forecasts for that reason . Dealers suggested the shares were coming down due to profit - taking from a run which has swept the shares up from 143 . 50 since the beginning of April . Supermarkets group De Boer moved against the general trend , rising 7 . 80 guilders to 158 . 80 after giving details of its mega - merger with wholesaler Unigro , which will push it into the number two slot in the Dutch grocery sector after Ahold . Semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography added 1 . 90 guilders to 94 . 00 , buoyed by gains in U . S . high technology stocks . Philips was 30 cents higher at 106 . 50 guilders . Stock split candidate ABN AMRO closed up 15 cents at 34 . 70 guilders , after opening at 35 . 10 guilders on the first day of business after its four - for - one share split . - - Keiron Henderson , Amsterdam Newsroom + 31 20 504 5000

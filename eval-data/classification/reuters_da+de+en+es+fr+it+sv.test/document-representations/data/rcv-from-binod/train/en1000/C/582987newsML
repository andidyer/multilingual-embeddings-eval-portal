UAL still opposes BA - AMR deal despite new alliance . United Airlines Chairman Gerald Greenwald said Wednesday that United ' s participation in the Star Alliance airline partnership did not change its opposition to the proposed pact between American Airlines and British Airways Plc . " There ' s a misconception about what we ' re doing compared to what American is proposing to do . There ' s only similarity and it ' s the word ' alliance . ' Beyond that , we part company , " Greenwald said . The Star Alliance - - which includes UAL Corp ' s United , Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Air Canada , Scandinavian Airlines System and Thai Airways International Ltd - - was formally announced earlier today . Although no merger will take place among the airlines , the carriers will have common branding in marketing and advertising and will coordinate routes and offer code - sharing , when possible . The alliance is a bid to cut costs and offer integrated , seamless travel for passengers and cargo . Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp , the corporate parent of American Airlines , said the Star Alliance was a " good news / bad news " story . " The good news is that the unveiling of the Star Alliance , which is far larger than the proposed American / BA alliance , will presumably end United Airlines ' s hypocritical opposition to our planned alliance , " said Crandall , who is also chairman and chief executive of American Airlines . The " bad news " is that the Star Alliance highlights the regulatory delay on both sides of the Atlantic that " have prevented American and British Airways from moving forward with an alliance we need in order to restore competitive balance in the transatlantic airline market , " he said . " We seek no special favor , only the right to compete with existing alliances and to offer our customers a wider choice , " Crandall said . In a conference call with U . S . reporters , United ' s Greenwald said the Star Alliance did not alter United ' s opposition to the American - BA pact , proposed by the carriers last year but mired in regulatory scrutiny . United and other critics contend that the proposed BA - American alliance would monopolize travel between the U . K . and the U . S . Greenwald said the Star Alliance would not prevent rival carriers from competing . " Any U . S . carrier is free to fly to anywhere in Germany . Any German airline if free to fly to anywhere in the United States . " In contrast , the U . K . is a very restricted , protected market , " he said . " American and BA are proposing to combine their resources without any tangible plan for a full opening of that ( UK ) market so other airlines can compete freely . . . If they ' re going to have that alliance , we want to be free to compete , " Greenwald said .

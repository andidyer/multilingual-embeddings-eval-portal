Thousands of Mobutu troops face uncertain future . Thousands of Zaire ' s defeated soldiers , obeying the instructions of Laurent Kabila ' s triumphant rebels , turned up at Kinshasa barracks on Tuesday hoping to get their jobs back . The soldiers and paramilitary police , routed by the rebels in a seven - month campaign , queued up at several locations to have their military identity papers checked and recorded . " We give each one a numbered token . They will be called back in due course and the Alliance will decide what to do with them , " said Kisala Malula , a gendarme under the regime of president Mobutu Sese Seko , who fled into exile last weekend . Kisasa and four colleagues sat at tables outside Camp Mobutu , a former gendarmerie barracks taken over by Kabila ' s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo - Zaire ( ADFL ) when it captured Kinshasa on Saturday . About two thousand men and women from Mobutu ' s army - the FAZ - and the paramilitary Civil Guard , lined up under a fierce sun wearing civilian clothes . A crowd of bystanders watched , jeering whenever they spotted a familiar and unpopular face among the vanquished servicemen . " We didn ' t fight or resist because we wanted change as well . We hope things will be all right with the Alliance , " said sergeant - major Gapo Nzengu , 45 , who joined the FAZ in 1977 and last served in the 8th military region in Kinshasa . Many of the soldiers were elderly and looked unfit . Mobutu ' s army was huge on paper but had almost no fresh recruits for the past decade . The official combined strength of the FAZ and gendarmes was 100 , 000 but senior officers pocketed the pay of legions of phantom troops . Yet Kabila needs many of the former regime ' s soldiers . His Alliance came to power thanks to direct military support from Rwanda , Uganda and Angola , diplomats and foreign military sources say , but now that victory is achieved he needs to build a genuine national army . " These foreign soldiers did a fantastic job for us , " said an intelligence officer with the Civil Guard queueing at Camp Mobutu . " But at a certain point they must go back home . " Zaire , renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo by Kabila , had military contracts or training deals during Mobutu ' s 32 - year regime with a bewildering array of countries . Belgium , China , Egypt , France , Israel , North Korea , the United States and the former West Germany were among the foreign partners who sold hardware and trained soldiers . But Mobutu ' s divide - and - rule style extended to the armed forces and security agencies . To protect his throne , he ensured there was no overall command , created rival units and placed his Ngbandi tribesmen in most of the key positions . Sub - Lieutenant Urbain Kaposa , one of the men queuing outside Camp Mobutu , said the 15 , 000 - strong Civil Guard was a serious outfit when he joined in 1985 , a year after it was set up with West German trainers . " But later it became very political and the Ngbandi were the majority , particularly in the command positions , " he said . A university graduate aged 37 , he earns only eight million Zaires a month , the equivalent of $ 50 before the rebel takeover . He said he made ends meet by securing the release of people wrongly detained by junior guardsmen . " My stock of food at home today is thanks to an Indian man I got out of prison , " Kaposa said . He said as long as Kabila did not try to replace Mobutu as a dictator , and agreed to work hand - in - hand with civilian opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi , he was ready to return to the military . " The nation spent a lot of money on my training and I want to serve it . But it will depend on the Alliance ' s policies , " Kaposa said .

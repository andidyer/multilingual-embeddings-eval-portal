Croatia plays down war crimes suspect extradition . Croatian media played down on Tuesday the first extradition of a war crimes suspect to the international Tribunal in The Hague and described pressure from the United States as " blackmail " . Experts said the extradition of Zlatko Aleksovski was a direct result of American pressure but was not a sign that more of the 18 indicted Croats would be handed over . Aleksovski was sent to The Hague on Monday and was due to appear before the United Nations court later on Tuesday when he is due to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty on charges including torture and murder . He will not be the first Croat to appear in front of the panel of international judges , but was the first to be extradited by his state . The United States has shown its impatience with Croatia ' s reluctance to cooperate with the court , most recently by abstaining from a vote at the International Monetary Fund to give Croatia nearly $ 500 million in loans . " It would seem that American pressure , American reminders to Croatia that it . . . really needs to follow its promises with deeds , coupled with very heavy hints of possible economic and financial repurcussion , have played a very important role , " Chris Cviic , a London - based Balkans analyst , said in Zagreb . " Croatia is seen as capable of playing a stabilising role ( in the region ) and the Americans are therefore not hesitating to use the clout that they have . " One diplomat said : " It ' s progress that ( Croatia has ) actually done something about it but . . . it ' s only one , and it doesn ' t let them off the hook with the rest . " He said opinion in the United States was not likely to be changed by Monday ' s events . " I think there ' s going to be continued pressure for them to cooperate but how far that bites financially I can ' t hazard a guess , " the diplomat added . Editorials claimed Croatia was being unfairly treated in comparison to its neighbours Bosnia and Yugoslavia who have made little progress in arresting and handing over suspects . Aleksovski was arrested almost a year ago but had not been sent as the authorities claimed he was ill . A team of doctors sent by the court pronounced him fit to travel last week . Weekly news magazine Nacional claimed he had been extradited to The Hague because of American " blackmail " . Of the 75 men indicted by the court only eight have found their way to The Hague and one has died of cancer . One of Croatia ' s highest - ranking officers , General Tihomir Blaskic , turned himself over and proceedings in his trial have begun . An editorial in the pro - government daily Vjesnik said " the pressures put on Croatia demanding further extradition . . . point to the fact that the whole situation is close to becoming absurd " . It said the Tribunal was showing " less and less interest " in apprehending Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic and former leader Radovan Karadzic " who are the main opponents of ( the Dayton peace agreement ) and the main butchers in Bosnia " . Cviic said : " I think there is some truth in the general feeling here that Croatia is sometimes criticised , perhaps not fairly , compared with others in the region . " " It would now seem to be very much up to the Americans to produce some action against Serb war criminals in the Bosnian Serb Republic , " said Cviic . " It is hardly likely Croatia would deliver any more without some sort of action on the other side . . . if some arrests were made it would do a great deal towards restoring some sort of balance , " he said .

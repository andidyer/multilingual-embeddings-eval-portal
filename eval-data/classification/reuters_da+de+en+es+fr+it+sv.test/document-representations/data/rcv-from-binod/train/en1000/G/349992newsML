Lott predicts lengthy CIA confirmation process . President Bill Clinton ' s choice to become the next top U . S . spymaster faces a lengthy confirmation process involving his investments and integrity , Senate Republican leader Trent Lott said on Sunday . Lott , appearing on the ABC - TV programme " This Week , " declined to predict confirmation of Anthony Lake , the nominee to become director of central intelligence . But he said he assumed Clinton ' s next most vulnerable nominee , Alexis Herman , would be confirmed as labour secretary if she can satisfy the Senate about questions on whether she blended her official and partisan roles as a White House aide . Lott said he expected some delay in dealing with Herman ' s nomination , but predicted Lake ' s would take " even more time because there you are talking about integrity , what he did with his own investments . " Both sets of hearings have already been postponed . Herman ran into problems over her alleged role in setting up a White House coffee meeting that as even Clinton acknowledged , improperly mixed business and politics . Lott , who met Herman on Friday , said he expected her to submit documentation to support her version of events . " If in fact Ms Herman can produce documentation and can convince the . . . Education and Labour Committee of what she told me , then I assume that she would be " confirmed , he said on ABC ' s " This Week . " He said Herman , director of the White House office of Public Liaison , had told him she did not set up a session in which Clinton hosted Democratic party fund - raisers , the leaders of 17 major financial institutions and the U . S . ' s top banking regulator . The Select Committee on Intelligence has tentatively rescheduled Lake ' s confirmation hearings to begin on Feb . 25 . " I think they ' re going to look at it very carefully , " Lott said on " This Week " . He referred to a Justice Department probe of Lake ' s failure to take timely action on orders to sell his personal holdings in energy stocks after Clinton named him National Security Adviser in 1993 . House of Representatives Republicans have asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Lake and other officials lied to Congress about their role in a controversial decision to turn a blind eye to the flow of Iranian weapons to Bosnian Moslems in 1994 despite a U . N . arms embargo .

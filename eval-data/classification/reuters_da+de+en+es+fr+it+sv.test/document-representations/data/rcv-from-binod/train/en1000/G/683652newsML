Six killed in Pakistan violence upsurge . Gunmen killed five men in Pakistan ' s central province of Punjab in an upsurge of sectarian violence and one in the southern port city of Karachi in apparent ethnic violence on Tuesday , police said . They said three men , two of them members of the minority Shi ' ite sect of Islam , were shot dead at a store in the central Punjab town of Jhang . The dead , shot by two gunmen on a motorcycle , included store owner and Shi ' ite activist Moazzam Ali Zaidi and his relative Shakil Haider Zaidi . The third man killed was a customer whose religious affiliation was unknown . In Lahore , gunmen on a motorcycle shot Khalil Ahmed , a lawyer for Azam Tariq - - leader of the militant Sunni Sipah - i - Sahaba Pakistan ( SSP ) organisation - - near the High Court building , killing him instantly , the police said . Ahmed , who had also been riding a motorcycle , was shot on his way to the court . Police said he died on the spot . Tariq succeeded to the SSP leadership after his predecessor , Ziaur Rahman Faruqi , was killed in a bomb blast in Lahore in January . Tariq was seriously wounded in that explosion . In a separate attack , police said gunmen killed a Shi ' ite activist named Ala Wasaya in Khairpur Tameywala , 100 km ( 62 miles ) south of the Punjab city of Multan . Khairpur Tameywala was the scene of a mass killing on April 25 , when gunmen shot dead nine people , including six Shi ' ites and three Sunnis , in a busy market area . In Karachi , capital of Sindh province , gunmen killed Jawed Ali , 35 , at Korangi in District East and a bomb explosion wounded Zaki Ahmed , 35 , and his nine - year - old son Naveed at Orangi in District West . Nobody claimed responsibility for the latest killings , but they appeared to be part of a long - running feud between Sunni and Shi ' ite factions which has cost more than 100 lives this year in Punjab . Differences between hardline groups among Pakistan ' s minority Shi ' ites and majority Sunnis have often spilled into violence , especially in the populous province . In Karachi , the latest death raised the toll to more than 120 in ethnic , sectarian and political violence there this year compared to 500 in 1996 and 2 , 000 in 1995 , according to doctors at government hospitals .

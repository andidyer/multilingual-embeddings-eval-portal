" Unforgettable " New Year leaves revellers cold . A promised " unforgettable " New Year ' s Eve in a French chateau with champagne flowing and onion soup at dawn literally left hundreds of would - be revellers out in the cold , the newspaper Le Monde said on Monday . A company called " Happy Days " touted New Year ' s Eve parties in more than a dozen chateaux and manors around Paris at 290 francs ( nearly $ 60 ) per person with live bands and dinner thrown in , the daily said . But when ticket - toting revellers showed up late on December 31 in Arctic temperatures they found gates closed and chateaux darkened . The owner of Breuil chateau south of Paris , surprised at seeing dozens of well - dressed people milling about in the cold outside his home , went to ask what they wanted . He had to call police to save himself from a crowd that became enraged when they learned no lavish buffet or other treats were awaiting them , Le Monde said . Police told the newspaper they believed about 2 , 000 people fell victim to a swindler who made off with about two million francs ( $ 400 , 000 ) pocketed to usher in his own happy new year .

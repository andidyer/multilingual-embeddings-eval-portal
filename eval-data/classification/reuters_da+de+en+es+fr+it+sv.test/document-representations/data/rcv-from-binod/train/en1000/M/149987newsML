S . Africa JSE lures fresh capital despite rand woes . While investors in South Africa ' s currency and bond markets have taken to their heels , the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ( JSE ) is attracting robust levels of fresh capital . Mark Durr , JSE listings director , said the number of new listings on the bourse this year would be about equal to the 27 last year , a boom year on the exchange . But the amount of capital introduced by listings this year will easily outstrip that of last year , and was already almost 50 percent higher in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 1995 . " Although we have more - or - less the same number of companies listing as last year , the big thing is that the amount of new capital raised from new listings far exceeds that of last year , " Durr said . JSE figures show capital introduced by listings in the nine months to September 30 , 1996 amounts to 4 . 7 billion rand ( $ 1 . 0 billion ) compared with 3 . 2 billion in the same period last year . Total new capital raised on the bourse in the nine - month period amounted to 18 . 5 billion rand compared with 14 . 6 billion a year ago and 19 . 7 billion for the whole of 1995 , Durr said . These figures cover capital from new listings , rights issues , scrip dividends and acquisitions of unlisted firms . " That is more an indicator as to the status of the exchange . It is quite unbelievable when you think of the volatility over the last year , the market ' s still been performing and raising the capital that is required , " Durr said . The JSE ' s all - share index has climbed over 11 percent so far this year in rand terms , but the ascent has been choppy and the gains have been wiped out for international investors by the fall in the rand . The rand has lost over 28 percent of its value against the dollar since the middle of February . Durr attributed the JSE ' s appeal to a combination of factors like continued foreign involvement in the South African equity market and the cheaper cost of raising equity relative to debt . " Higher interest rates have made equity relatively cheaper ( than debt ) and a more attractive method to fund expansion . " The market has been extremely resilient and to some extent this is because of foreigners who are increasingly becoming invested in our market , " he said . Latest JSE figures show foreigners have been net buyers of South African stocks to the tune of 5 , 082 . 71 million rand in the year to date compared with 4 , 256 . 93 million in the same period in 1995 . Other factors were an improved political climate especially in the strife - torn Kwazulu - Natal province and a relatively high level of business confidence . Durr said the JSE , which has already seen 21 new listings this year , expects approximately a further six before the end of the year . He declined to name them . Companies that have said they will list in 1996 include financial services group Forbes , which debuts on November 4 , paint wholesaler Amlac on November 6 , farming co - operative OTK a week later and Grincon , the unbundled construction arm of Grinaker Holdings Ltd , on December 2 . Durr said although there had been many company delistings from the JSE in 1996 , they had been " quite innocuous " . " A lot of them are schemes of arrangements or takeovers with groups rationalising themselves into sometimes larger and more competitive units . There are very few liquidations , so we are not losing value to the board , " he said . Twenty - three companies have left the bourse so far this year with a further three pending in November . This compares with 24 in the whole of 1995 . ( $ 1 = 4 . 69 rand )

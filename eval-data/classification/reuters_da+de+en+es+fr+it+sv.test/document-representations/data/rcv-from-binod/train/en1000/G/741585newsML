Four Jordanian parties announce elections boycott . Four small Jordanian opposition parties said on Sunday they were pulling out of parliamentary elections planned for November . They said they were heeding the call for a boycott made by the influential Moslem Brotherhood to protest government steps since 1993 elections which the opposition say have sidelined parliament . The four parties involved , who do not hold a parliamentary seat between them , are the Jordanian People ' s Democratic Party , the Jordanian Arab Constitutional Party , the National Labour Front and the Arab Jordanian Ansar Party . The Jordanian People ' s Democratic Party won one seat in the 1993 elections but its deputy then defected to another party . The other three parties were set up since the last elections . " In the last four years the conviction has set in among the people that the coming parliament will be the least reflective of the popular will , " the parties said in a statement . The opposition says successive governments appointed by King Hussein since the 1993 elections have marginalised parliament . They opposed unsuccessfully the ratification of Jordan ' s peace accord with Israel and have demanded the government revoke laws on the press , the economy and the elections themselves . No date has been set for the elections , which are due in November . Prime Minister Abdul - Salam al - Majali has said he is ready to talk to the Brotherhood but warned that the elections will go ahead with or without them .

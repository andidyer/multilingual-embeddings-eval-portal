Japan industry chief sees steady metal prices . Non - ferrous metal prices are not likely to fluctuate significantly in the near term , the head of a leading Japanese metals industry group said on Monday . " I don ' t think there will soon be a sudden change , " Yumi Akimoto , chairman of the Japan Mining Industry Association , told a press conference when asked for his view of the market . Akimoto , who is also president of leading Japanese copper smelting company Mitsubishi Materials Corp , was speaking at his first news conference since his appointment as the association ' s chief . Prices on the London Metal Exchange have held mostly steady in recent weeks after strong rallies in February and early March . Akimoto said that , although a recovery in world copper prices after last June ' s fall and a weakening of the yen had brought rising earnings and revenues to Japan ' s smelters , the outlook was clouded by the pending increase in Japan ' s national sales tax and possible movements in exchange rates . Japan ' s smelters have enjoyed a sizeable windfall due to the yen ' s weakening against the dollar in recent months . The smelters ' treatment and refining revenues from mining companies are denominated in dollars , so any strengthening of the dollar directly boosts their yen - based earnings . - - Tokyo Commodity Desk + 81 - 3 - 3432 - 6179

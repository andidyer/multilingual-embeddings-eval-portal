INTERVIEW - Telecom Finland seeks growth overseas . State - run telecommunications operator Telecom Finland seeks growth overseas and wants up to 30 percent of its net sales to be generated abroad by the year 2001 , a Telecom Finland ( Tele ) official said on Wednesday . Tele is a candidate for privatisation or part - privatisation but with no timetable set for any issue ; although transport and communications ministry officials say they have been frequently visited by investment bankers . The Finnish telecoms market has long been very competitive , causing operators to build top infrastructure and know - how , and now that the market is mature , Tele must look overseas , export director Jarmo Sundin said in an interview with Reuters . International operations started last year and have so far been a very modest share of group turnover at 6 . 4 billion markka in 1996 , but this year net sales in international operations are budgeted at over 200 million markka , he said . " The target is that sales generated abroad would rise to 30 percent of turnover , " Sundin said . " International services are expected to start making profits at the end of 1998 . " He said Tele is not seeking to join any recently formed international alliances since it has sufficient resources at the moment and sees little to gain , but does not intend to build its own large international data and telecommunications network . " We are looking to cooperate with someone who has a network or will build one ; it would make little sense for us to build our own networks everywhere , " Sundin said , adding that Tele expects the future of tele and datacommunications to be based on ATM ( Asynchrounous Transfer Mode ) infrastructure . Tele has been a forerunner in implementing new infrastructure and systems for mobile , data and traditional telecommunications . On Wednesday it launched what it said was the world ' s fist fully integrated commercially available voice telephone - personal computer system , called Neophone . This ATM system has been designed for corporate intranets and cannot yet be used in the Internet since its bandwidth does not support the service , but Tele aims to start offering the it overseas next year . - - Helsinki Newsroom + 358 - 0 - 680 50 292 , news @ reuters . fi

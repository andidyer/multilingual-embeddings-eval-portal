Slovak President calls NATO , election referendums . Slovak President Michal Kovac said on Thursday he had called two crucial referendums , on direct presidential elections and NATO membership , to be held together on May 23 and 24 . The two referendums concern a vote on a constitutional change to allow the president to be elected by a direct popular vote , and a decision on whether the country should , or should not , join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) . The referendum on the direct election of the president was called after a petition organised by the parliamentary opposition . The referendum on NATO membership was approved by parliament last month and has three questions - whether voters favour NATO membership , support the deployment of nuclear weapons on Slovak territory and whether they support allowing foreign military bases on Slovak soil . " I shall launch a personal campaign before the two referendums and will advocate a " yes " vote to both , " Kovac said after announcing the dates . Kovac ' s term of office expires next spring , while elections to a new parliament , which would elect a president under the present constitution , will only be held in the autumn .

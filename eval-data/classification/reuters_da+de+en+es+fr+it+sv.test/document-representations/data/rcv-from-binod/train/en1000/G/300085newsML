U . S . welcomes Georgian move on diplomat . The United States welcomed as a courageous move Friday ' s announcement by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze that he was prepared to lift the immunity of a Georgian diplomat involved in a fatal car crash in Washington . But U . S . officials said that Shevardnadze ' s statement did not amount to lifting the diplomat ' s immunity and Georgia would have to take that decision if U . S . authorities decided to bring charges . A statement issued in Tbilisi said : " The president of Georgia is prepared to waive the diplomatic immunity of Gueorgui Makharadze . Makharadze shall remain in the United States of America until the completion of the investigation and legal procedures unless a different agreement between the two governments is reached . " The State Department said Shevardnadze called in the U . S . charge d ' affaires in Tbilisi on Friday to deliver the same message , which followed an appeal to him by U . S . Secretary of State Warren Christopher to waive Makharadze ' s immunity . " The United States very much welcomes this step by chairman Shevardnadze . It ' s a courageous step . It ' s highly unusual in modern diplomacy to see a head of state take such a responsible and courageous position , " department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . The U . S . attorney ' s office said this week it believed it had sufficient evidence to prosecute Makharadze over last Friday ' s crash in which a 16 - year - old Brazilian girl living in the United States , Joviane Waltrick , was killed . But it has not so far brought formal charges .

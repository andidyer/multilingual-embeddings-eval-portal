Singapore rubber trade thinned out by holidays . Trading in Singapore rubber sputtered to a weak close on Tuesday with a holiday in Japan and anaemic buying weighing heavily on the market , dealers said . The ongoing strike at Goodyear Tire added to the gloom in the market , they said . " There were no leads because of the start of the Golden Week holiday season in Japan , " a dealer said , adding an industry dinner in the Thai rubber centre of Hat Yai on Friday has driven most players to the sidelines for an early vacation . " The big boys were not in today . All these holidays are keeping people glued to the sidelines , " another dealer said . Traders said volume in the market was extremely thin . " I can ' t really say much if nothing is happening today , " another trader said . " I made a bid for June RSS3 but nobody wanted to sell . " The RSS1 and TSR20 award contracts were untraded and only small deals were seen in the the RSS3 and TSR20 FOB grade rubber contracts . At around 0945 GMT , June RSS3 was seen unchanged at 107 . 25 U . S . cents a kg . October / December TSR20 was seen also unchanged at 107 . 25 U . S . cents a kg . - - Rene Pastor ( 65 - 8703305 )

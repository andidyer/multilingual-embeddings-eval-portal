Volvo trucks to set up India operation . The truck unit of Swedish automotive group AB Volvo said on Friday that it will start production in India in the first quarter of 1998 . " We have now bought land in Bangalore and estimate that we will begin production there in the first quarter of 1998 , " Volvo Trucks spokesman Stefan Lorentzson told Reuters . Currently Volvo Trucks is looking for a builder for the plant , which is estimated to take between 12 to 18 months to build . In addition Volvo Trucks has sent field test vehicles to be tested on local roads . " When we have taken the step to send field test vehicles , we mean business . The project is almost entirely ready after having been in the blueprint stage , " he said . The vehicle being tested in India is the FLT 10 , which is a medium weight truck for regional transportation . In Pakistan preparations are continuing according to plan and there Volvo Trucks estimates the first trucks will leave the assembly line in June this year . In Japan Volvo Trucks is on the offensive and work to set up a nationwide network of service stations continues . " Today we have 25 service stations in Japan . The goal is to have 70 by the end of 1997 by linking certain workshops to us . A large network of service stations is key for sales , " Lorentzson said . Another step towards Volvo Trucks realising its goals in Asia is the preliminary studies the company is conducting with Mitsubishi . " Sometime in 1997 we will decide whether we will cooperate or not , " he said . " The idea is to see if we can cooperate on a truck aimed to be sold primarily in southeast Asia . " Volvo Trucks efforts to conclude negotiations with Chinese authorities about local production have not been rewarded . " But the negotiations continue and we are trying to drive them forward . We also have a working group on site in China . Our goal to be set up in the country is unchanged and we hope to do this this year , " Lorentzson said . - - Henrik Alberius , Stockholm newsroom + 46 - 8 - 700 1250

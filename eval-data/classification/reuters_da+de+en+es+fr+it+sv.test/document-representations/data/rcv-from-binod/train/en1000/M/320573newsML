Dow extends record run after Greenspan address . U . S . blue chips rallied to their 10th record close of the new year on Tuesday , as financial markets breathed a collective sigh of relief after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s address to a U . S . Senate committee . The Dow industrials climbed 40 points to close unofficially at 6884 . The rise was paced by Boeing Co , which surged 7 - 5 / 8 to 114 - 1 / 8 , and International Business Machines Corp , which gained 2 - 3 / 8 to 169 - 3 / 8 ahead of the release of the company ' s fourth - quarter earnings . For much of the session , attention was fixed on Greenspan , who appeared before the Senate Budget Committee to discuss the state of the economy . Although he warned about the risks of wage - driven inflation , Greenspan ' s address was mostly upbeat . He said the economy showed vigor with little sign of inflationary tensions . " Greenspan ' s speech was much more market - friendly than the comments he ' s previously made and the comments made recently by some other Fed officials , " said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany . Bonds rallied soon after Greenspan ' s testimony ended , giving stocks the green light to resume their climb . The gains were largely confined to the blue chip and technology issues that have enjoyed the most success of late . The technology - laden Nasdaq Composite gained 12 . 71 points or 0 . 93 percent to a record 1376 . 99 , while the Nasdaq 100 , which includes the 100 largest companies on Nasdaq , surged 13 . 98 points or 1 . 55 percent to a record 913 . 73 . IBM , whose sharp rally during the regular session suggested investors were optimistic about its fourth quarter , did beat estimates , reporting after the close it earned $ 3 . 93 per share in the period , a nickel better than Wall Street ' s consensus estimate of $ 3 . 83 a share , according to First Call . IBM earned $ 3 . 09 a share in the quarter a year ago . While analysts viewed the results favorably , many felt an even higher number was needed for IBM to sustain its rise . " I don ' t get the feeling we ' re going to get more exuberance in the price , " said Thom Brown , managing director at Rutherford Brown and Catherwood . " But in the long term that ' s a very good number , " he added . " It ' s an excellent performance . " IBM shares dipped to 168 in after - hours trading , off 1 - 3 / 8 from its regular session close . Far clearer was Wall Street ' s attitude about Boeing ' s decision to kill plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet . Industry analysts said the decision removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing and estimated the move could save the aerospace giant more than $ 2 billion in expenses over the next five years . In other individual issues , medical ventilator maker Nellcor Puritan Bennett Inc tumbled 5 - 3 / 4 to 18 after the disappointed investors with a second quarter operating profit of $ 0 . 20 per share , down from $ 0 . 30 per share a year ago . Mafco Consolidated Group Inc jumped 8 - 1 / 8 to 35 - 1 / 4 after its corporate parent Mafco Holdings Inc offered to buy the 15 percent of Mafco it did not already hold for $ 38 . 50 per share in cash . The S & P 500 index rose 6 . 02 to 782 . 72 and the NYSE Composite rose 2 . 26 to 411 . 57 , both records . ( ( - - Wall Street desk , 212 - 859 - 1730 ) )

CME hogs end higher on firmer cash ideas . Expectations that lower pork values will prompt demand and that packers will generally pay steady to firm prices for cash hogs boosted CME hog futures again at the close . Pork bellies remained mixed in mostly local dealings , traders said . Hog futures closed 0 . 575 cent per lb higher to 0 . 150 lower with only thinly traded distant months lower . June ended up 0 . 050 at 80 . 475 and July up 0 . 300 at 80 . 450 cents . Pork bellies finished 0 . 875 lower to 1 . 150 higher with July off most at 82 . 800 . Cash market sentiment turned mostly steady to firm for Wednesday and futures rose on commercial buying , traders said . Although cash pork products were mostly under pressure Tuesday morning , expectations are that the lower price levels for some products will spark demand for pork . Hog marketings remain light in many areas , they said . " With the price levels that we have on the product , we ought to see increasing product demand , " said Dale Benson , vice president and senior livestock analyst for Dean Witter . Rand Financials remained an active buyer of July against long fund rolling by Goldman Sachs . Lind - Waldock bought July and August early and spreaders in the pit were buying July and selling August , pit sources said . In hog options , ABN Chicogo Corp sold October 64 calls , pit sources saidNearby pork bellies remained under pressure from weak cash , but recovered from lows and traded uneven late as short - covering developed , traders said . USDA reported cash bellies down $ 5 to $ 6 per cwt at noon with 14 - 16 lbs at $ 76 to $ 78 , the lowest level since May 6 . Added resistance came from locals that were looking for a small out - movement from out - of - town warehouses last week compared with analyst estimates that pointed to a much higher withdrawal , traders said . Analysts had been looking for the CME weekly out - of - town report to show a net out - movement of between 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 million lbs . Pit traders were only looking for an out - movement of 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 million lbs . After the close , the CME reported a net out - movement of only 0 . 106 million lbs . However , short - covering was evident as cash bellies usually find buying interest at $ 80 or under , they added . RBH notably bought late after early selling from E . D . & F . Man and LFG , pit sources said . ( ( Jerry Bieszk 312 - 408 - 8725 ) )

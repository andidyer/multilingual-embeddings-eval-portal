Fate of Belgian minister Di Rupo unclear . A Belgian minister quit his job on Monday after allegations of under - aged sex with boys which he denied , while the fate of another - - federal Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo - - hung in the balance . Both Di Rupo and Jean - Pierre Grafe , of the French - speaking Walloon regional government , have firmly denied they had sex with people under the legal age of consent of 16 . But Grafe felt he could not work properly and resigned his post , a day before Belgium ' s highest court - - the Cour de Cassation - - was due to hand over a report on Grafe . A special commission of federal parliamentarians were assessing allegations of paedophilia against Di Rupo , a Francophone socialist and discreet homosexual , and the number two in the Belgian government . An initial set of allegations made by a sole witness was thrown out by the highest court as unsubstantial , it was revealed at Monday ' s commission meeting , but a second set based on anonymous sources was still being examined . The commission is to resume its work on Tuesday . The Cour de Cassation had not been able to form an opinion on the second dossier since it had been added to the Di Dupo case file at short notice . " According to the report ( from the Cour de Cassation ) no credibility can be accorded to the sole witness , " Raymond Langendries , the president of parliament who also chairs the special commission , told reporters . " There is not the slightest serious indication that could warrant the indictment of Deputy Prime Minister Di Rupo before the Cour de Cassation , " he added . The allegations against Di Rupo have served to undermine public confidence in Belgium ' s political and legal system , already weakened by an unrelated child sex and murder scandal and ensuing revelations of bungling by investigators . Both politicians , police forces and representatives of the legal class have been embroiled in a bitter war of words , with parliamentarians attempting to force through stringent reforms to bring an antiquated legal system up to date . Langendries said the commission called in the Brussels public prosecutor who compiled the case files on Di Rupo . The high court ' s damning report on the sole named witness was a slap in the face for the prosecutor and the police for failing to fully investigate the allegations before airing them . Belgian public confidence has been shaken since the unrelated arrest in mid - August of rapist Marc Dutroux , the subsequent rescue of two young girls and discovery of the bodies of four more . In October more than 250 , 000 people took to the streets of Brussels in support of the victims and their families in a demonstration that crossed the country ' s language divide and rapidly turned into a show of anger at the system . Recent work on a series of legal reforms and long - awaited political changes might come too late for Di Rupo . Some of his peers have already called for his resignation on the grounds that a publicly - known homosexual should not hold high government office . Any decision by the special commission - - to reject the allegations , to uphold them and send Di Rupo before the high court or to ask for more investigations - - must go to the full parliament for endorsement . An indictment would end Di Rupo ' s political career . A similar procedure brought down former NATO Secretary General Willy Claes . He resigned in October 1995 after parliament indicted him over allegations of bribery when he was a Belgian economics minister in the late eighties . Further investigation - - echoing a decision the commission reached earlier this month on the initial dossier against Di Rupo - - would drag out the paralysis facing the Belgian government while Di Rupo ' s fate was uncertain . It might also trigger further anonymous witness reports .

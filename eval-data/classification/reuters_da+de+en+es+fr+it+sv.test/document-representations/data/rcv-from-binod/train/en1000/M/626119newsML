London gold fixes firmer focus , switches to silver . Gold fixed slightly firmer on Friday but precious metal dealers ' attention turned to silver after the recently rampant platinum group metal markets seemed to burn out for now . Following spectacular rises this week , palladium was indicated at $ 187 . 00 / $ 190 . 00 per ounce about $ 2 . 50 off Thursday ' s close and platinum was unchanged at $ 409 . 00 / $ 413 . 00 . The interest in silver , which has been friendless for weeks while palladium was being pushed to its highest prices since 1980 , came after a " panic " rise in palladium prices in Tokyo and $ 20 fall later in the day , dealers said . They said borrowing costs for silver had climbed from around 1 . 8 percent for a month to around five percent since Thursday . " They ( speculators ) have targeted another metal which has no risk of central bank selling , " one dealer said . Another dealer forecast silver could test $ 5 . 00 if it broke above its current $ 4 . 85 / $ 4 . 87 , eight cents above Thursday ' s close but added interest was mainly speculative . " The higher borrowing costs could lift the underlying ( price ) making $ 5 . 95 / $ 5 . 97 possible , " another said . Gold meanwhile fixed at $ 345 . 75 per ounce up from $ 343 . 90 on Thursday after prices firmed modestly in New York and the Far East on somewhat tentative dealing . Dealers were unclear on whether or not there was a positive fall out for gold in the row which blew up late on Wednesday between the German government and the Bundesbank on revaluing the country ' s gold reserves . Also a moot point for gold was the likely impact of Germany ' s economic problems on the European Monetary Union start in 1999 . Some dealers sensed gold might be benefiting along with the dollar from a flight to safety from the mark . It was meeting overhead selling from producers . " It ' s going to be a battle for every dollar on the upside , " one dealer said . Palladium one - month lease rates were around 40 percent for a month a few points off Thursday ' s levels and lending of platinum took its month rate down to about 30 percent . Dealers said they were backing off palladium after it slumped $ 20 from its peak on the futures yesterday at $ 210 . 20 . " As soon as the people ( funds ) responsible for all the buying and borrowing try to sell another ounce , there will be another $ 20 drop . They don ' t have room to liquidate their position , " a dealer said . - - Brian Spoors London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8058

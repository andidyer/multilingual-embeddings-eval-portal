Dirty tanker rates seen staying firm next week . Middle East very large crude carrier ( VLCC ) dirty tanker rates held firm on Friday with signs that the strength is likely to continue next week , brokers said . " Looking at the VLCC list , certainly up until 15th June , tonnage is thin on the ground as it has been for a long time and even stretching up to the 20th of the month , choice from a charterer ' s point of view is very limited , " said brokers Galbraith ' s Ltd in their weekly tanker report . " Charterers left with cargoes in this period will surely face higher freight rates . For the back end of June , the picture is not quite so clear but we see no reason for rates to fall from those prevailing today . " Brokers E . A . Gibson agreed , saying that " with our projected tonnage figures only showing 37 vessels of about 11 . 3 million tons as being available over the next four weeks , we would expect the present trend to continue . " Mideast / Japan VLCCs were on Friday fixed at W70 , with voyages to Rotterdam at W60 and to the Red Sea at W72 . 5 . Galbraith ' s said most of the deals took place on a couple of busy days in the middle of the week , and it was " quite an extraordinary situation to see old ships achieving much higher Worldscale rates than their modern cousins . " " The reason can simply be attributed to the fact that the young ships were the first to be booked - - thus leaving only older units available for charterers . " Owners of these units suddenly found themselves ' holding all the trump cards . ' " West Africa / U . S . VLCCs continued to be fixed at W65 , while 130 , 000 tonne vessels ( Suezmaxes ) fetched around W90 / 92 . 5 . In the Med / Black Sea , Suezmaxes achieved around W95 to U . K . / Cont Med and trade on the 80 , 000 tonne Aframax market was brisk . Galbraith ' s said that although recent deals have been around W110 - 120 , " one or two owners are starting to offer at pretty steamy numbers which might suggest increases in the forthcoming period . " The North Sea Aframax market dipped , however , to about W130 / 135 , some 10 points down from last week . The Caribbean Aframax market , which has been unusually firm for much of the year , remained resilient at W200 , with some brokers taken by surprise each time it bounces back after a dip . " There is no doubt that natural demand is clearly established in this market but another reason might be the absence of re - lets from the lighterage companies - - for the last few months we have seen very few of these ships competing with other owners , as they are fully employed doing what they should be which is lightering the V ' s and U ' s ( VLCCs and ULCCs ) into the U . S . Gulf , " said Galbraith ' s . European fuel oil was also strong with 25 , 000 tonnes in the north rising to about W240 as the Russian Baltic export season begins . Industry consultants Petro Logistics said exports from the Baltic and Black Sea in the first week of May totalled around 330 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , against about 170 , 000 bpd in the first week of January . - - Michael Rank , London newsroom + 44 171 542 4088

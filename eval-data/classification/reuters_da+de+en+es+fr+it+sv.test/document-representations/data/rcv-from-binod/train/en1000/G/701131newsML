NBA BASKETBALL - HORNETS SIGN DAVID WESLEY AS FREE AGENT SHOPPING BEGINS . The Charlotte Hornets wasted no time in shopping the NBA free agent market , which opened for business Tuesday , by signing point guard David Wesley , who had been with the Boston Celtics . Nearly 170 players became eligible for free agency Tuesday , with the biggest names available , Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan and New York Knicks centre Patrick Ewing , expected to re - sign with their own teams . The 26 - year - old Wesley averaged 16 . 8 points and 7 . 3 assists per game for the woeful Celtics last season . He became expendable when Boston selected Colorado guard Chauncey Billups with the third overall pick in the draft . The Hornets did not disclose terms of their deal for Wesley , who said he was happy with the contract offer he received on the first day of free agent signings . " What ' s there to wait on ? , " Wesley said . " I got what I wanted . This is a good place for me and I ' m happy to be here . " Wesley played one season for the New Jersey Nets before joining the Celtics in 1994 . His scoring average has steadily increased in his four - year career and he joins a Hornets team that won a franchise - record 54 games last season . " One of the reasons Charlotte appealed to me so much was the opportunity to play for a winning team , " Wesley said . " Adding David tremendously improves the makeup of our team , " Hornets coach Dave Cowens said . " There is no doubt we are a better team today than we were yesterday . " Wesley is the likely heir apparent to the popular Mugsy Bogues , the smallest player in the NBA and the last remaining member of the original 1988 Hornets squad . The 5 - foot - 3 ( 1 . 60 m ) Bogues , 32 , has been bothered by knee and hamstring injuries the last two seasons .

Some Japan banks return to black , but gap widens . Most of Japan ' s long - term credit banks and major trust banks announced on Monday that they returned to the black in the last business year , posting modest profits . But analysts said that some leading banks were still struggling and that the gap between strong and weak banks is widening as they continue to dispose of problem loans - - the legacy of aggressive lending in the 1980s " bubble " era . " The financial strength at second - tier banks further deteriorated in the last business year because of active problem loan disposals in the past few years , " said Katsuhito Sasajima , an analyst at Nikko Research Centre . On Friday , most of Japan ' s leading commercial banks announced sturdy profits , helped by low interest rates . On Monday , all but two of the next 10 biggest - - which include three long - term credit banks and seven trust banks - - announced they had made profits in the business year ended March 31 . The total of problem loans written off by the 20 biggest banks - - including the commercial banks and the 10 banks which announced their earnings on Monday - - was around 6 . 2 trillion yen ( $ 53 . 4 billion ) in 1996 / 97 , down from about 11 trillion ( $ 94 . 8 billion ) worth of disposals a year earlier . The financially weak banks must improve their credibility to ride out growing competition spurred by Japan ' s " Big Bang " financial deregulation while continuing to write off problem loans , analysts said . " Such weak banks must implement drastic restructuring or they may be forced to eventually seek outside capital or merger partners , " Sasajima added . Many top banks also struggled to post profits in the last business year as they were unexpectedly forced to mark down appraisal losses on shareholdings as stock prices fell , analysts said . Of the three long - term credit banks , Nippon Credit Bank Ltd ( NCB ) posted a parent current loss for the second straight year in 1996 / 97 after disposing of more than 400 billion yen ( $ 3 . 44 billion ) of bad loans in the past two business years . Current earnings include gains or losses from securities holdings . NCB announced a drastic restructuring programme in April , including a withdrawal from overseas operations and an increase in its capital by issuing new equities to other banks and insurance companies . It also signed a business agreement with Bankers Trust to securitise its real estate and other assets . NCB senior managing director Tadao Iwaki told reporters on Monday that the bank is confident about its restructuring plan , but it may take a few months to resume normal fund - raising . The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd ( IBJ ) said that it had decided to change its corporate structure as of June 27 in order to win business opportunities after the " Big Bang " financial reforms . IBJ announced its parent current profit was 43 . 6 billion yen ( $ 375 million ) in 1996 / 97 after it disposed of 261 . 21 billion yen ( $ 2 . 25 billion ) of problem loans . The seven major trust banks posted their biggest ever operating profits , totalling 1 . 3 trillion yen ( $ 11 . 2 billion ) in 1996 / 97 against 652 billion yen ( $ 5 . 62 billion ) in 1995 / 96 . Trust bank executives said that the jump in operating profits was due to a change in government regulations which enabled them to transfer a large chunk of reserves they had built to support their trust accounts into operating profits . They added , however , that this was a one - off phenomenon and their operating profit in 1997 / 98 is expected to fall to 689 billion yen ( $ 5 . 93 billion ) . Trust banks manage and invest clients ' assets as well as offering normal banking services . Among the seven major trust banks , Nippon Trust Bank Ltd , a subsidiary of Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi Ltd , announced a parent current loss for the third consecutive year in 1996 / 97 . Analysts said , however , that Tokyo - Mitsubishi , the world ' s biggest bank and the financially strongest bank in Japan , would continue to support its subsidiary . Meanwhile , Yasuda Trust & Banking Co Ltd said that it would cut its less profitable assets by two trillion yen ( $ 17 . 2 billion ) over the coming three years from 8 . 6 trillion yen at the end of March to focus on improving profitability . " In particular , we would like to streamline our overseas operations , " an executive said , adding that the bank hoped to resolve its bad loan problems in 1997 / 98 . ( $ 1 = 116 yen )

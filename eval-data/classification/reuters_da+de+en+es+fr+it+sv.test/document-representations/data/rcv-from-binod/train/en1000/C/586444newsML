Dow to buy Lilly ' s stake in agricultural venture . Dow Chemical Co . said Thursday it will acquire Eli Lilly and Co . ' s 40 percent stake in their agricultural chemicals venture , Dow Elanco , for $ 900 million plus $ 300 million in undistributed earnings . The $ 1 . 2 billion transaction , a result of Lilly ' s decision to exercise an option to sell the stake , will make Dow the sole owner of the Indianapolis - based operation , which was formed in 1989 and has annual sales of about $ 2 billion . The Lilly - Dow deal followed by one day Merck & Co . Inc . ' s agreement to sell its agricultural chemicals unit to Switzerland ' s Novartis AG for $ 910 million . Wall Street analysts called the timing of the deals a coincidence , but added that they do signal a quickening of mergers and acquisitions in the agricultural chemicals field . " It is a rapidly consolidating business , " said Prudential Securities chemicals analyst Glenn Mierendorf in New York . " These deals take two more drug companies out of the crop chemicals business . . . We would expect to see more consolidation , " Smith Barney analyst James Wilbur said . At Dow ' s annual shareholders meeting in its hometown of Midland , Mich . , Chief Executive William Stavropoulos said he views agricultural chemicals as a key growth engine for the company and will consider future acquisitions in the sector . " We think the industry is continuing to consolidate and if we can participate in that , with the right prospect , we will , " Stavropoulos said . He said he expects Dow Elanco ' s sales to grow to about $ 5 billion year 2005 . " This acquisition is part of our value growth strategy to increase investment in performance businesses , he said . Drug manufacturers for years did basic chemical research so broad that they would often discover compounds valuable to farming , if not to medicine . Those discoveries are becoming rarer , however , as research gets more focused . At the same time , discoveries in biotechnology are pressuring traditional crop chemicals ' profits , making drug firms all the more eager to get off the farm , analysts said . " You have two companies in Merck and Lilly that have vibrant , higher - margin pharmaceuticals businesses and ag - chem is a distraction , " Cowen & Co . analyst Stephen Scala said . Stavropoulos said Dow , with $ 20 billion in annual sales , has enough resources to be very successful in traditional agricultural chemicals and was raising its committment to developing biotechnology . " We can handle it , " he said . The Dow Elanco venture , whose sales and profits have grown , combined the plant science businesses of Lilly and Dow , as well as Dow ' s speciality pest management business . It makes and markets products to control weeds , insects and plant disease and for urban pest control . Dow Elanco also is majority owner of Mycogen Corp . , an agricultural biotechnology company that markets , among other things , seeds for plants that are resistant to disease . Dow Chemical also announced a 16 percent increase in its quarterly dividend and said it would repurchase an additional 20 million shares . The increased quarterly payout of 87 cents , up from 75 cents previously , marks the 85th consecutive year that Dow has raised or maintained its dividend . Dow Chemical said the new stock buy - back will begin once the current repurchase authorisation is completed in the second quarter . The shares will be bought on the open market or in private transactions . Since January 1995 , Dow has repurchased 55 . 3 million shares , or about 20 percent of its outstanding stock . As of April 30 , Dow had 231 . 9 million shares outstanding . Dow Chemical ' s stock fell $ 1 . 125 to $ 87 . 675 trading on the New York Stock Exchange , while Lilly added 87 . 5 cents to $ 93 . 50 , also on the NYSE .

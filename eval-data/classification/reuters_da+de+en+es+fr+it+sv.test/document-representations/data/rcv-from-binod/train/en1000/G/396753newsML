Netanyahu hires lawyer in Israel corruption probe . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , warned by police about self - incrimination , has hired a lawyer to protect his interests in an investigation of alleged government corruption , the attorney said on Sunday . Criminal lawyer Yaakov Weinrot confirmed an Israel Television report that at least part of Netanyahu ' s questioning by police last week had been " under caution " , triggering more speculation the probe could topple his government . Under Israeli legal procedure , police caution people they question when they believe charges might be filed against them , said legal analyst Moshe Negbi . " I am not representing a lonely man , I am representing a very self - confident man , " Weinrot told Army Radio , saying Netanyahu hired him on Saturday night . " He is certain the police will prove his innocence in this investigation . " Police questioned Netanyahu for four hours on Tuesday about his short - lived appointment last month of Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar - On , an activist in his Likud party , as attorney - general . Israel Television said on January 22 Shas party leader Aryeh Deri , on trial on corruption charges for the past three years and a key figure in the ruling coalition , had pressed to have Bar - On named to the post to arrange a plea bargain . Bowing to such alleged pressure would fall under the criminal charge of breach of public trust , legal experts say . " If it transpires there were such things . . . everyone knows the government will not survive - - period , " Foreign Minister David Levy told Army Radio on Sunday . Netanyahu , Deri , Bar - On and some 20 others , including cabinet ministers , legislators and lawyers , questioned in the investigation have denied any wrongdoing . Weinrot , a legal heavyweight who has represented Deri in what he called an unrelated case , said Netanyahu had no intention of stepping down pending the outcome of the inquiry , widely expected to last several more weeks . According to last month ' s television report , Deri had demanded Bar - On get the attorney - general job in exchange for Shas ' support for Netanyahu ' s accord with the PLO on an Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron last month . Bar - On quit 12 hours after taking office amid allegations by jurists and politicians that he was not qualified . Nissim Zvilli , secretary - general of the main opposition Labour party , said it was " beginning preparations for early elections " because the probe could bring down the government . Labour leader Shimon Peres , who lost last May ' s election to the Likud party ' s Netanyahu , declined to say on Sunday whether he would run again for prime minister if a new poll was called . Weinrot said Netanyahu viewed " very gravely " what the attorney described as a police leak to Israel TV on Friday that investigators had warned him about self - incrimination . After Tuesday ' s questioning , the head of the police investigative branch praised Netanyahu for cooperating fully . " He ( Netanyahu ) told me that this plague of leaks was something he had not expected to see , at least not in such a sensitive investigation , " said Weinrot , who pleaded his client ' s case on both Army and Israel radios . But the lawyer said he had not advised Netanyahu to invoke his right to remain silent if he is questioned again : " Even if the prime minister has criticism about the investigation . . . he will cooperate with the police , give them all information and answer any question he is asked .

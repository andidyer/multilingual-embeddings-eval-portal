Southern Electric sets 156 mln stg buyback . British regional electricity company Southern Electric Plc said on Friday it would offer shareholders a buyback scheme which could return up to 156 million pounds ( $ 253 million ) through an issue of bonus shares . Southern , one of Britain ' s few remaining independent regional electricity companies ( recs ) after a spate of takeovers , followed a trail blazed yesterday by water utility Yorkshire Water Plc by offering a share consolidation that will give all holders free B shares . It will then offer to buy back these shares at a fixed price , in Southern ' s case 60p per existing ordinary share . " Irrespective of the size of their shareholdings , shareholders will have the opportunity to participate equally , " Southern said in a statement , explaining that it would set up a system for dealing in the B shares without charge or commission . As in Yorkshire ' s case , the plan is intended to create what the company called " a more efficient capital structure " as well as improving the marketability of its shares . Though the firm is creating a stock split through which it will have more shares in issue , Southern said it stood by its plan to pay a final dividend of 30 . 1 pence per existing share in this year . That will equate to 15 . 05 pence per new share . The plan follows a clear statement of intention by the Southern board last November to return value to shareholders by March 1997 . Approval for the deal will be sought at an extraordinary meeting on February 28 . After the announcement , Southern ' s share price rose firmly on the London market . By 0840 GMT it was trading up 15 pence at 802 - 1 / 2 pence . ( $ 1 = . 6172 Pound )

Tullow says Pakistan well flowed gas . Tullow Oil Plc said on Thursday that its exploration well Sara - West No . 1 , located onshore Pakistan , has flowed gas at rates of up to 25 million cubic feet per day from a gross gas column of 95 metres . Analysis of the gas indicates a composition of 14 percent combustible hydrocarbons , 62 percent carbon dioxide and 24 percent nitrogen . Tullow said in a statement the proportion of the non - combustible components was higher than anticipted . The well has been suspended pending further evaluation . " We are disappointed by the quality of the gas discovered in the Sara West - 1 well , which we consider to be sub - commercial at present , " Tullow managing director Aidan Heavey said . " We are encouraged , however , that the well has confirmed a potentially large accumulation in a new type of play , in an area where several undrilled structures exist and where the quality of gas is generally good , " he added . Heavey said Tullow remained optimistic about the potential for these structures to contain good quality gas in commercial quantities . He said the drilling rig was now being moved to the commercial Sara field to drill the Sara - C appraisal well . - - Dublin Newsroom + 353 1 676 9779

Pound hits Smith & Nephew first - half profit . British healthcare firm Smith & Nephew Plc on Tuesday reported an 11 . 75 percent fall in first - half profits , mainly due to the pound ' s strength . Pre - tax profit fell to 81 . 1 million pounds ( $ 128 . 3 million ) from 91 . 9 million , at the top - end of analysts ' expectations . The strong British currency sliced 11 million pounds from the profit figure , Smith & Nephew said . Apart from the pound , Smith & Nephew also suffered from the dollar ' s strengthening against continental European currencies . The group ' s main producing facilities are in Britain and the U . S . with continental Europe being an important export market . Excluding currency effects and the launch costs of a major new product - - Dermagraft - - underlying profits grew by three percent , Smith & Nephew said . Currency would remain a negative factor , it added . The launch of skin graft product Dermagraft is " gathering momentum " and it is envisaged to make a sales contribution later this year . Dermagraft , which hits the UK market in October , is considered a revolutionary product which could have peak turnover of 300 million pounds by 2003 , analysts said .

GOLF - GRAHAM MARSH WINS U . S . SENIOR OPEN BY ONE STROKE . Australian Graham Marsh captured the first major title of his 28 - year career on Sunday by winning the U . S . Senior Open by one stroke over South Africa ' s John Bland . Marsh earned the biggest payday of his career , collecting $ 232 , 500 after Bland bogeyed the tournament ' s final hole to give the Australian the championship . " This one is right up there at the top of the list , " Marsh said . " Even though it ' s not a major in the sense of a ( regular PGA Tour ) major , it ' s a mini - major . " Everyone tries to win this championship in senior golf because it ' s the number one championship of senior golf . " Not a single player broke par for the tournament - - the third of four majors on the Senior Tour - - with Marsh winning on an even - par 280 total for 72 holes . He won despite a final - round of four - over 74 that included seven bogeys and the title was in doubt until the final hole . " I felt all along it would get down to the last few holes of the championship , and I ' m glad I was just able to hang in there all day , " Marsh said . Marsh and playing partner Bland were deadlocked atop the leaderboard with two holes to go and both birdied the 17th to remain tied for the lead . On the par - 4 18th , Marsh stuck his approach shot within 10 feet , while Bland ' s second shot found the bunker to the right of the green . Bland scrambled , barely missing a 12 - foot par putt that would have put pressure on Marsh , who two - putted to become the third player this year to post back - to - back victories on the Senior Tour . After winning last week ' s Nationwide Championship , Marsh is the first player in six years to win the U . S . Senior Open without breaking par . The victory raised his 1997 earnings to $ 819 , 226 - - third on the Senior Tour money list - - and secured Marsh ' s automatic entry to next year ' s U . S . Open at San Francisco ' s Olympia Club . Bland finished alone in second at 1 - over 281 after a final - round 73 that included five bogeys . " I was very confident coming off 17 , just having a birdie there and going back to level par , and I desperately wanted to get a birdie on 18 , " Bland said . " He is a good friend and a wonderful champion , " Bland said of Marsh . " But you don ' t really think about that when you ' re out there . I ' m trying to beat Graham . " At least I didn ' t bite Graham ' s ears off , " joked Bland , referring to the grisly end of Saturday night ' s heavyweight title fight , which ended when Mike Tyson was disqualified after biting off a piece of Evander Holyfield ' s ear . Gil Morgan and Tom Wargo tied for third at 2 - over . Hale Irwin and Jack Nicklaus had their best rounds of the event to finish in a five - way tie for fifth at 4 - over 284 . Irwin fired a 67 - - the best round of the day - - while two - time champion Nicklaus finished with a 69 . Hugh Baiocchi , Leonard Thompson and Dave Eichelberger also finished four strokes behind Marsh .

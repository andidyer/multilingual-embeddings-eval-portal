Africa - bound U . S troops to be armed for protection . [ CORRECTED 21 : 00 GMT ] The United States on Thursday ( Corrects from Friday ) said U . S . troops sent to Zaire with the international force to help starving refugees would be armed to protect themselves but not for combat operations nor disarming rival factions . Defence Secretary William Perry said the U . S . force , including 1 , 000 troops based in Goma , Zaire , in a region ravaged by factional fighting , would have " robust " rules of engagement for self - protection . " We will have arms and have what we call robust rules of engagement to allow our forces to protect themselves , " Perry said , but added : " We are not planning a mission to go in and disarm factions or to separate the military from refugees . " President Bill Clinton , re - elected last week for a second term but anxious to avoid being sucked into an open - ended operation , opted conditionally for U . S . forces to take part in the emergency mission , subject to lengthy consultations . While the consultations go ahead , the military has begun preparing for the operation , sending a team to scout conditions on the ground . Pentagon officials also said two U . S . Navy P - 3 Orion surveillance planes have begun tracking the refugees , who have scattered in the remote countryside fleeing fighting between rival Hutu and Tutsi militias and Zairian forces . The 1 , 000 U . S . troops to be sent to Goma will secure and run the airport and set up a protected corridor about 2 miles ( 3 km ) long from Goma to nearby Rwanda so refugees may return home if they chose to do so , Pentagon officials said . In addition , about 3 , 000 U . S . troops will go to nearby countries to help arrange an airlift of emergency supplies . They will be part of a multi - national force of some 15 , 000 troops under the command of Canada ' s Lt . Gen . Maurice Baril . Clinton ' s National Security Adviser Anthony Lake went to the United Nations in New York on Thursday to consult with other contributing countries . The Security Council could vote on a resolution , drafted by Canada , to bless the mission as early as Friday . Washington says it wants clarification of the terms of the mission including its length and commitments on the " acquiesence " of rival fighting factions before finally sanctioning the troop deployment . Pentagon officials say U . S . troops could start moving to the region as early as next week . The initial force is expected to include soldiers from the United States , Canada , Britain , France , Spain , Italy , the Netherlands , South Africa and Senegal , diplomats at the United Nations said . Most of the refugees in Zaire are ethnic Hutus who fled Rwanda after genocidal tribal warfare there in 1994 . Rwanda now is controlled by the rival Tutsis , who drove out the Hutus after suffering massacres in the 1994 fighting . The refugees recently fled their camps along the Zaire - Rwanda border when a Zairian Tutsi group , facing expulsion from Zaire , began attacking Zairian troops . Perry spoke to reporters after talks with Defence Minister Severin Adjori of the West African state of Benin . They were expected to discuss African participation in a possible follow - on force after the projected four - month international humanitarian effort winds up . The United States has painful memories of its involvement in a U . N . relief mission to Somalia in 1993 , when 18 U . S . soldiers were killed in a firefight while pursuing a Somali warlord , prompting partisan political recriminations .

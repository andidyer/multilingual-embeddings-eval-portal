Spanish stock market wobbles on budget jitters . Madrid stocks tumbled nearly one percent on Friday on jitters about proposals in the upcoming 1997 budget which could make or break Spain ' s chances of joining in Europe ' s single currency launch . Stocks in regulated sectors like electricity , telephone , gas and petrol all fell at the open amid speculation that a portion of tariffs in these sectors could go towards paying the public deficit next year . The general index was down 2 . 49 points , 0 . 71 percent , to 345 . 87 at midday while the Ibex - 35 leading share index fell 31 . 03 points , 0 . 78 percent , to 3 , 992 . 30 . Market talk was centered on an article in financial daily La Gaceta de los Negocios which said the government would raise tariffs at a rate below official expected inflation of 2 . 6 percent in 1997 to help moderate price pressures . It would also collect a portion of tariffs , estimated at 600 billion pesetas ( $ 4 . 79 billion ) , to help meet its target of reducing the budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product in 1997 , the level required to join a single European currency . The Economy Ministry denied the report . " The state has asked industry for a contribution to lower inflation as long as this does not hurt corporate results but not to transfer part of their income to cut the deficit , " a spokesman at the ministry said . The budget , due to be presented to parliament by the end of the month , is widely seen as the biggest test so far for the four - month - old government of conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar . It has pledged an austere package to allow Spain to be among the first wave of countries to join a European economic and monetary union in 1999 . The government has already announced spending cuts , frozen public sector wages and raised taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and it says real spending will fall one percent in 1997 . Analysts said Friday ' s sharp reaction to La Gaceta ' s report reflected the market ' s sensitivity to any news about the budget as different revenue - generating schemes are bandied about . " I think it ' s quite indicative of how nervous markets are , " said Juan Cueto , director of analysis at Ibersecurities brokerage . Although most dismissed the newspaper report as unclear and unreliable , it sparked discussion throughout financial circles over how the government would proceed assuming it did want to raise extra cash from regulated monopolies . " It is significant , " said Henrik Lumholdt , chief economist at Bank of America in Madrid . " I doubt that it is totally a story out of the blue . " If the government introduces a new tax on firms it would only make the state ' s budget account figures look better in the short - term at the price of dealing with future company deficits . " You can milk these companies in the short - term and make the finances look better , " he said . " But you ' re just shooting the problem further down the line . " In either case , a forecast of 600 billion pesetas revenue was totally over - optimistic . " It sounds like hocus pocus to me , I don ' t see how it can happen , " Lumholdt said . " I don ' t think it ' s very reliable , " Ibersecurities ' Cueto said of the report . " The only possibility is for the state to create a new tax ( on companies ) . " Analysts said fears of lower tariffs in the telephone and electricity sectors reflected a 17 percent drop in Gas Natural this week , following the government ' s decision to raise natural gas prices by less than expected . The implication was that regulated sectors would cease to be cushioned by the government via their pricing systems . " It ' s picking up on the theme in a broader way , " said Eric Rovick , equities analyst at AB Asesores brokerage in Madrid . " The regulated sectors are going to come under pressure .

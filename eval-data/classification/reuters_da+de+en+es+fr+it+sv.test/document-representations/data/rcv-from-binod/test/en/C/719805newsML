SAirGroup to sell four U . S . hotels . Swissotel , SAirGroup ' s hotel - management unit , said it would sell 99 percent of its ownership in four hotel properties in Atlanta , Boston , Chicago and New York to Blackstone Real Estate Advisors . However , SAirRelations , SAirGroup ' s service division , said Swissotel would retain the management of the properties . Blackstone has also acquired a 25 percent holding in Swissotel ' s management company for its U . S . hotel interests . A spokesman for SAirRelations declined to mention the sales price , but said the deal would have a positive impact on the profit and loss account and be listed as extraordinary income . Analysts estimated a sales price for the hotels of around $ 400 million while the hotels are valued at around $ 300 million on SAirGroup ' s books , giving a book gain of around $ 100 million . " This is an important strategic move for us , " the statement quoted SAirRelations president and chief executive Wolfgang Werle as saying . " It not only provides a platform for the expansion of Swissotel ; it also allows our shareholder to see a return on its U . S . investment , " it added . Each of the four hotels , which include the 550 - room New York Drake Swissotel , have recently been renovated and room rates average around $ 160 . Blackstone Real Estate Partners is part of the Blackstone Group , a privately - held merchant bank headquartered in New York . Blackstone has acquired more than $ 3 . 5 billion worth of real - estate in North America and Europe since 1993 , including controlling interests in 40 full - service hotels valued at in excess of $ 1 . 5 billion . Swissotel currently operates 15 hotels in Europe , the Middle East , Asia and North America . The sale is part of Swissotel ' s strategy of reducing the capital tied up in properties but expanding the management of hotels globally . Swissotel ' s managing director Andreas Meinhold said in March that he wanted to manage more than 20 hotels by the end of 1997 and 60 by 2000 . He added that this goal would be reached through a strategic alliance , for example with a medium - sized partner that has 30 to 40 hotels . The Swissotel unit was a problem child for SAirGroup for many years , but it finally returned to profitability in 1996 when it posted an operating profit of 41 million Swiss francs based on operating revenue of 294 million . Invested capital was 751 million . - - Peter Nielsen , Zurich Editorial + 41 1 631 7340

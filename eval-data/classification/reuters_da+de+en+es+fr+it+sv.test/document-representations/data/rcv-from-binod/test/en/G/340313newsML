Albanian opposition condemns wave of arrests . The Albanian government said on Wednesday it had detained a considerable number of people across the country following violent demonstrations sparked by the collapse of get - rich - quick pyramid investment schemes . The move was roundly condemned by the main opposition Socialist party which accused the ruling right - wing Democrats of intimidation and said they had effectively introduced a state of emergency . Rioting swept this poor Balkan state last weekend , with protesters , fearing for their life savings , setting fire to government buildings and offices of the Democratic Party in southern towns . " In the districts where destruction and burning down of state institutions have taken place , the police have stopped and accompanied to the police stations a considerable number of citizens , " the Interior Ministry said in a statement . A ministry spokesman declined to say precisely how many people had been arrested and said there was no political motivation behind the detentions . The Socialist party said its leader in the southwestern city of Vlore , Eduard Alushi , had been arrested . " Presently a de - facto state of emergency has been established . Mass arrests have taken place , " the secretary general of the Socialist party , Rexhep Mejdani , told reporters . " This shows the government tries to intimidate the population away from the peaceful process intended to solve its troubles , " he said , adding that Alushi had tried to stop the weekend riots , not encourage them . The Interior Ministry insisted it had evidence that everyone arrested had taken part in the wave of rioting . " The detention of these citizens . . . is totally based on facts , witnesses and incontestable proofs , which testify that these citizens have encouraged , organised and executed the violent actions , " the interior ministry statement said . " Not in a single case has their detentions been due to the party affiliations that some of them may have , " it added . Many Albanians sank their life savings into a welter of pyramid schemes that sprang up following the demise of the old communist regime in late 1990 . Some critics have blamed the government for the failure of the private funds . Earlier on Wednesday President Sali Berisha said investors caught up in the investment scams might not be fully compensated . Hours later police broke up an anti - government rally in Tirana organised by Hazem Hajdari , one of the leaders of the revolt which toppled the old communist elite . On Sunday parliament gave Berisha temporary powers to use the army to maintain order . Taking no chances , the government announced on Wednesday that it had cancelled all public sporting events where large crowds can gather .

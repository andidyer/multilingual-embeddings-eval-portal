FOCUS - Philippine shares dip to 20 - month closing low . Philippine shares sank to a 20 - month closing low on Thursday and analysts said the market is likely to wallow in red ink amid the volatility in the region ' s currencies . A slump in the Indonesian rupiah pulled down other Southeast Asian currencies including the peso which fell to a low of 29 . 620 to the dollar in early trade . " The currency volatility plus the fact that most of the first - half corporate earnings are out make the market starved for stock ideas , " said Jun Trinidad , research head at DBS Securities . The composite index fell 33 . 59 points , or 1 . 33 percent , to 2 , 493 . 49 points , the lowest close since December 1995 despite positive news on interest rates . The central bank on Thursday dropped its overnight borrowing rate by four percentage points to 14 percent . At the same time , it raised banks ' liquidity reserves to five percent from four percent to reduce liquidity and curtail speculation that might arise from lower interest rates . The declining peso and the higher reserves on banks weighed down the market , traders said . " We are nearing the support and tomorrow it will have to be tested , " said Henry Ong , analyst at Sapphire Securities . Traders have pegged initial support at 2 , 460 and the next level at 2 , 450 points . Some said a major support lies at 2 , 400 . Analysts said the fall of the peso , which had lost 12 percent of its value since a de facto devaluation on July 11 , will eventually lead to higher prices because Philippine industries depend on imported raw materials . " Fundamentals will further deteriorate with higher inflation levels in the second half . The stock market is down on the mat but still conscious . So we can expect it to be battered some more , " said Noel Reyes , vice - president at Anscor - Hagedorn Securities . Traders said the possibility of more negative news may even drag the market lower with first - half gross national product expected to be released by the end of the month . " We do not expect first - half gross national product figures to be spectacular and it will just be in line with expectations . Unles the currency problem is settled , we see a bearish market , " said Jidgette Valenzuela , research manager at Lippo Securities .

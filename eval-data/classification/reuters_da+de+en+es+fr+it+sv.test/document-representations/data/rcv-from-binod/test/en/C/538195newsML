Guest Supply sees year EPS below estimates . Guest Supply Inc said Friday that it does not expect to meet analysts ' estimates for the year . The company reported a second quarter loss of $ 1 , 319 , 000 that included charges of nearly $ 2 . 2 million for damaged goods and $ 426 , 000 in other nonrecurring expenses . " Unfortunately , the non - recurring and unusual charges mask the significant improvements that have been made to the company ' s manufacturing and distribution operations and will prevent us from meeting analysts ' estimates for the year , " the company said in a statement . Wall Street had been expecting Guest Supply to earn $ 0 . 08 a share for the second quarter and $ 0 . 93 a share for the full fiscal year 1997 , according to First Call consensus estimates . Guest Supply provides personal care items to the hotel / motel industry and makes other health and beauty products for consumer products companies and retailers . The company said it believes the charges and changes , including its plant expansion and consolidation of its warehouses , better position it for the future .

Panama Canal toll hike decision postponed . The Panama Canal Commission ( PCC ) has postponed until Nov . 15 a decision on whether to increase tolls and charge for on - deck container space , PCC chairman Joe Reeder said on Thursday . He told a news conference that PCC officials " made the decision to extend until November 15 the written comment period , " thus allowing users more time to send their comments . Several shipping firms and some South American nations have objected to the planned increases , he said . The PCC wants to raise the general toll rate by 8 . 2 percent as of Jan . 1 , 1997 , and by 7 . 5 percent in 1998 . " In general , those in the shipping industry in the Far East understood and expected tolls to increase , " Reeder said . " But we have heard those say please don ' t raise tolls . And we are very concerned about Latin American countries , especially those on the western seaboard , " he said . Reeder said the increases were made necessary partly because of an acceleration in the $ 3 billion maintenance and capital improvements program from 20 to 10 years . " We can ' t decide not to increase tolls and have a capital expenditures program . If we don ' t take care of the canal , our customers will find an alternative way to go , " he said . The PCC now charges for under - deck or enclosed spaces and the proposal to charge for on - deck container space is scheduled to go into effect at the same time as the general toll rate increase . Tolls have been raised six times since the canal began operating in 1915 . The last rate hike was 9 . 9 percent in 1992 . - - Laurens Grant , Panama City newsroom , 507 2237739

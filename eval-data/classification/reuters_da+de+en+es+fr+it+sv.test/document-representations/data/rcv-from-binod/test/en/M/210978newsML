The local yield curve also steepened as the long - end continued to do battle at resistance around the 7 . 0 percent yield barrier on the benchmark 10 - year bond . However , the Australian / U . S . 10 - year yield spread tightened to below 90 basis points at one stage , although this is also proving an obstacle . U . S . Treasuries remained around their slightly softer levels seen in New York during Tokyo trading , having met resistance after this week ' s overall firm tone . The local market outpaced Canadian debt , which was fairly mixed on Thursday as its yield curve steepened on speculation of another easing by the Bank of Canada after a weaker than expected retail sales report . The New Zealand market was firm , also taking its cue from a firm local currency , but still underperformed against Australia . - - Colin Brinsden 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

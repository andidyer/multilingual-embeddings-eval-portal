Argentine gays may claim partner ' s pension - officials . Argentine homosexuals may legally claim widow and widowers ' pensions when their partners die , officials told local media on Wednesday . " Social security clearly serves a purpose of social alliance rather than separation . . . with regard to both homosexual and heterosexual situations , " Social Security Secretary Carlos Torres said on local radio . Under current law , pensions may be collected by widows or widowers or by live - in partners as long as the couple lived together for at least five years " in apparent matrimony . " When the social security law was passed in 1994 it was aimed at granting pension rights to unmarried heterosexual couples , but it says nothing about homosexuals . " The terminology used by the law leaves the door open for these types of situations . Undeniably there is a legal basis for granting such pension claims , " social security specialist and former government official Estela Luna was quoted as saying in Wednesday ' s Clarin newspaper . Social security officials told reporters on Wednesday that " in principle " homosexuals should not be discriminated against when it comes to pension rights . The precedent was set by the union - run health care programme for teachers , which agreed to extend services to the partners of homosexuals , recognising them as family members . " The law speaks of the spouse or live - in partner , without specifying gender . The only requirement is having lived together for at least two years , " said Rafael Freda , head of the Argentine Gay - Lesbian Integration Society and a member of a local teachers ' union . The example set by the teachers union was quickly followed by the flight attendants union . " This institution has a large homosexual population and we have been receiving requests for health coverage which were suspended . Now that there is a legal precedent , we can grant them , " Alicia Regidor , vice - president of the flight attendants ' healthcare plan , told Clarin .

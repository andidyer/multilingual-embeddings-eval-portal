Clinton flexes U . S . muscle after Iraq Kurd attack . President Bill Clinton on Saturday reacted strongly to a budding Gulf crisis , ordering U . S . forces in the region on high alert in response to Iraqi attacks on Kurdish rebels . In a most unusual setting for a policy announcement - - an unscheduled roadside stop during a post - convention campaign swing by bus through west Tennessee - - Clinton said Iraq ' s storming of the Kurdish stronghold of Arbil was a matter of " grave concern " to the United States . " Today I have placed our forces in the region on high alert and they are being reinforced , " Clinton said . His announcement followed telephone consultations with top advisers in Washington and a huddle with Gore between campaign stops . Clinton told the crowd that Iraqi forces had overrun Arbil , in a part of northern Iraq controlled and populated by the Kurds , but that the situation was unclear , with reports of heavy fighting in populated areas . He added that there were indications that Kurdish factions might be involved in the operations with Iraq . " These developments . . . cause me grave concern , " Clinton said , adding : " It is premature at this time , and I want to emphasize that - - highly premature - - to speculate on any response we might have . " U . S . defense officials said military flights to enforce no - fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq had doubled over the weekend . A senior administration official traveling with the president said Iraq had not violated a United Nations no - fly zone established to protect the Kurds . U . S . plans rely heavily on air power to deter military adventurism by Baghdad , but there are also 23 , 000 U . S . troops in the region . In addition to 158 F / A - 18 , F - 14 and other fighter planes on the aircraft carriers Vinson and Enterprise , which are in the region , an Air Force air expeditionary force of 30 to 40 F - 15 and F - 16 fighter planes and fuel tankers is ready to fly from three U . S . bases in the United States , defense officials said . This would include nearly 1 , 000 Air Force personnel in ground and support crews , they said . White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters the administration was puzzled about what the military objectives of Saddam Hussein might be , but he said the Iraqi president " never misses an opportunity to miscalculate . " A senior administration official said the United States had repeatedly warned Iraq that it would be making " a very serious mistake " if it intervened in an internal power struggle among Kurdish factions that has caused bloody fighting in northern Iraq . But the official downplayed chances of an imminent U . S . military response to Iraqi defiance of Washington . " I expect to see over the course of coming days a fairly extensive diplomatic effort as the international community understands and addresses what we see happening in Iraq , " the official said . Defense officials said no U . S . forces had actually moved because of events in Northern Iraq . But they said contingency planning had been completed . Also on Saturday , Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole called for the ban on Iraqi oil sales to continue given the movement of Iraqi forces into northern Iraq and disregard by Iraq for U . N . - approved inspections of its nuclear facilities . These developments , Dole said , " reinforce my belief that the move to relax sanctions on the sale of Iraqi oil was premature and ill - advised and should not be implemented , " he said .

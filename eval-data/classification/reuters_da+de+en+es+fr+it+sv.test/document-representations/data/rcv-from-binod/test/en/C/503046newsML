U . S . post office said considering 34 - cent stamp . The U . S . Postal Service is considering raising the price of a first class stamp to 34 cents as well as increasing other postage rates , industry sources said on Friday . The 34 - cent stamp would go on sale in mid - 1998 . An increase from the present 32 cents would be the first since 1995 , when the letter stamp rose from 29 cents . While the Postal Service was concentrating on an increase in the first class rate , the sources said , in the end it would most likely also propose increases in rates for other classes that could hit direct mail advertisers and others . The Postal Service said no recommendations for an increase had been made to the service ' s Board of Governors but there could be an announcement soon . In 1996 , the service reclassified its pricing system , increasing the rate for some classes of mail and lowering it for others , but with no increase in the first class stamp . The Postal Service ' s rate proposals were first reported in the Washington Post , which said Postmaster General Marvin Runyon had endorsed the 34 - cent stamp . Runyon had planned to hold off an increase until 2000 but changed his view when his managers projected a 1998 postal deficit of $ 1 . 3 billion , the paper said . Under law , the Postal Service must submit proposed rate changes to the independent Postal Rate Commission , which then holds hearings and has 10 months to act . The commission could approve the increase or reject it and ask the Postal Service to reconsider its proposals .

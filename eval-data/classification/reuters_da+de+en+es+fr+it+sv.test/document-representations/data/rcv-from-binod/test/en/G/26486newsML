Lebanese voters say they are paid to back Hariri . Dozens of Beirut voters said on Sunday they had been paid or promised 100 , 000 Lebanese pounds ( $ 64 ) each for voting for billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al - Hariri in Lebanon ' s parliamentary election . They told a Reuters reporter they were promised the money by Hariri election representatives after they agreed to swear on the Koran , the Moslem holy book , to go and vote for Hariri . The voters were among more than 200 people the reporter saw queuing outside a petrol station in the Tarek al - Jdeideh district of west Beirut which was plastered with Hariri election posters and marked as Hariri ' s election office number 19 . They told Reuters they had sworn on the Koran as requested , and their identity documents had been stamped at the election office with the letters q and b , apparently representing the Arabic word " qabd " - - to be paid . They then went to vote and had returned to the office where they were told to wait until the money arrived . As the voters spoke to the reporter a cry suddenly went up : " The money came . The money came , " and the crowd surged forward into the election office . Several people brandished up to 10 identity documents , demanding payment for each of them as they rushed forward . The Reuters reporter saw a man at the head of the queue hand over his identity document to Hariri officials in the management office of the petrol station , who apparently checked that it had been stamped after he swore on the Koran . The reporter then saw the man receive 100 , 000 pounds but he refused to give Reuters his name as he left . A few minutes later camera crews from two private Lebanese television stations and Reuters Television arrived and began filming . They were followed in minutes by a dozen Lebanese army soldiers in an armoured personnel carrier who leaped out and ordered people to leave and seized the television cameras and the camera of Reuters photographer Jamal Saidi . An officer told the journalists the cameras were seized because they took pictures of the troops , which is banned in Lebanon . It was not immediately possible to contact members of Hariri ' s campaign team for comment . Stories of voter bribery in Lebanese elections are not rare . The price of a vote in Beirut during the last parliamentary elections in 1992 is said to have been $ 50 . Opposition candidate Issam Naaman told the private Beirut television station LBC on Sunday that " a rich candidate " was handing out $ 100 each to voters at Tarek al - Jdeideh and another election office in Beirut . Um Bassam , a woman in her 40s , told Reuters that young men from the Hariri office had knocked on the door of her home nearby to offer her money . " They told me to come and swear to vote for Hariri and I would get 100 , 000 pounds . So I came and swore on the Koran and I voted for Hariri , although I had been planning to vote for ( former prime minister Selim ) Hoss if anyone , " she said . ( $ = 1 , 562 . 50 pounds )

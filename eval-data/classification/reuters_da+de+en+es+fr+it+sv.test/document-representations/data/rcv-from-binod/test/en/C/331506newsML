Chrysler denies summer Toledo groundbreaking plan . Chrysler Corp . said Thursday it has not set a construction timetable for a new plant that will replace its Toledo , Ohio , Jeep factory , despite a report that it wants to start the project by mid - year . The Toledo Blade reported that Chrysler has notified local utilities that proposed sites for the new plant must be available for a construction start in mid - year . Chrysler has said it plans to replace the Toledo factory - - the nation ' s oldest surviving auto plant - - in the next few years , but it has not previously disclosed a timetable . Chrysler spokesman Tony Cervone said Chrysler has not decided on a construction timetable and has not yet selected a site for the plant . " Nothing has changed since the last time we discussed this , " Cervone said . He added that Chrysler has committed to locating the project within a 50 - mile radius of the central Toledo facility which will allow the company to use the existing workforce , which now totals about 5 , 600 people . The Blade reported that the letter asks utilities to submit rate proposals for a plant starting production in the year 2000 . Analysts estimate that Chrysler will invest up to $ 1 bilion for the facility . The Toledo plant - - the city ' s largest employer - - currently builds recently improved versions of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicles . Startup of the new plant will be timed to coincide with a new product cycle , Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said at the recent Detroit auto show . On Tuesday , Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade said the company was weighing whether to build on part of the existing Stickney Avenue site or selecting a new " greenfield " site in an outlying area . " It certainly would be more expensive to do a greenfield site , but there are many advantages to doing it , " Valade said , adding that those include certain accounting advantages . The city of Toledo has proposed assembling land around the existing plant for Chrysler , which would call for some local companies to move . Parts of Toledo ' s Jeep plant date back to 1910 , and have gone through several owners , coming into Chrysler ' s hands when it bought American Motors Corp . in 1987 .

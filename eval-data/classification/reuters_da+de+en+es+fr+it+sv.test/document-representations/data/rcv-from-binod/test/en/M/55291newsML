Aluminium tumbles to new two - year LME low by close . Aluminium ' s recent run of price declines showed little sign of ending during Monday LME trading , with the market ending close to a fresh two - year low of $ 1 , 414 . Elsewhere , copper sagged to some extent as spreads softened after " third Wednesday " September pricing , although losses were fairly small - scale . Other metals largely cued off copper , traders said . In aluminium , the current weakness is failing to generate little more than routine physical interest in most areas , as consumers can sit back and adopt a hand - to - mouth policy , safe in the expectation that prices will remain soggy , traders added . The market fell under the $ 1 , 420 level this afternoon , which is putting prices on course for more significant falls and a test of $ 1 , 400 and below in the short term . Meanwhile , there is likely to be another stock increase on Tuesday . Last kerb business was at $ 1 , 415 , a $ 21 loss from last Friday ' s kerb close . In copper , the midsession pricing against the prime date was routine and signalled subsequent light selling and freer offers of metal on the nearby spreads . Cash / threes was around $ 6 backwardation at one stage before finishing at $ 9 / 10 , still down from Friday ' s $ 18 premium . Stocks are expected to be drawn down in the next few weeks , although Tuesday ' s LME data may not show these declines . Prices held close to the $ 1 , 860 level throughout the session , closing at $ 1 , 865 , down just $ 5 . Nickel prices subsided in the afternoon under disappointed liquidation , hitting lows of $ 7 , 350 at one stage when sell - stops under $ 7 , 400 were triggered before final business at $ 7 , 420 , a $ 140 loss from Friday . Traders said the market hardly reacted to the Inco lock - out and talks break - down at Thompson , Manitoba , as this development was not a surprise . Also Inco said today supplies to customers would not be disrupted . Zinc drifted lower during mostly slow trading , holding in a fairly tight band for most of the session , underpinned to some extent by expectations of another stock decline on Tuesday . But the market came under pressure during the kerb , slipping under $ 1 , 020 to close at 1 , 018 $ , a $ 5 decline . Lead was hit by some technical selling and stale bull liquidation after the midsession pricing , with the breach of $ 800 seen as depressive . Prices concluded the kerb at $ 785 , down $ 24 from the previous close , with the market looking to the battery sector for solace in coming weeks . Tin mirrored the overall sluggish trend in the sector and backtracked in slow conditions , meeting some support near $ 6 , 100 . Last business was at $ 6 , 115 , down $ 45 from pre - weekend levels . Alloy was quiet and only thinly - traded , with three months closing at $ 1 , 235 / 40 a tonne , against a previous closing indication of $ 1 , 246 . - - Martin Hayes , London newsroom 44 171 542 8080

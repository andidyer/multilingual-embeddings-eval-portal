S . , Russia , France , Britain and China - - signed with numerous other countries last month . " India ' s position ( on the nucelar test ban treaty ) is to a certain extent understadable , but I beleive that the position will develop and change , especially with respect to the perspective of gradual worldvide liquidation of nuclear weapons , " Havel said . India said it will not sign " this unequal treaty , not now , not later " until the atomic powers devise a timetable for destroying their nuclear arsenals .

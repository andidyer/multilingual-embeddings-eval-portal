Security forces teargas backers of new Zaire PM . Security forces in Zaire ' s capital Kinshasa used teargas on Wednesday against supporters of new prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi , following the declaration of a nationwide state of emergency . Witnesses said armoured vehicles blocked access to the embattled Central African nation ' s prime minister ' s offices , where the veteran opposition leader and foe of President Mobutu Sese Seko had planned to install himself with his team . Several thousand supporters of Tshisekedi had gathered outside his residence in the western district of Limete to follow his motorcade to the prime minister ' s offices . The crowd , which was following Tshisekedi ' s motorcade , broke up in the face of the teargas . Elsewhere in town , thousands of Tshisekedi supporters stopped traffic letting only fellow militants through . Tshisekedi ' s motorcade left the scene but it was not immediately clear whether he had continued his journey to the prime minister ' s offices . Mobutu , who seized power in 1965 but has seen his hold over the sprawling country crumble as the rebels advance , announced the state of emergency via a decree read on state television late on Tuesday . He appointed military governors to Kinshasa and other areas not under rebel control . His decree did not make clear what restrictions would be imposed or the implications for Kinshasa and its more than five million people . Tshisekedi is under fire from Mobutu supporters and allies alike after less than a week in the job and announcing a government composed only of his most loyal followers . He earmaked six posts for the rebels , who took up arms in October vowing to topple Mobutu and who hold nearly half of the country , but the offer was rebuffed . Rebel leader Laurent Kabila , speaking in Mbuji - Mayi , the capital of Tshisekedi ' s diamond - rich home province of Kasai on Tuesday , said the new prime minister and his supporters should make a complete break with Mobutu . " The real problem with Tshisekedi is that Mobutu is always in the background , manoeuvring to divide the opposition and remain always in control , " said Kabila , for whom Kasai is a key test of rebel support . Earlier in the week , Tshisekedi supporters staged protests to block efforts by his critics in parliament to unseat him . Outgoing prime minister Kengo wa Dondo and his team have said that Tshisekedi ' s government has not formally taken power as it has not won the blessing of the transitional parliament . Parliament voted out Kengo following persistent charges that he mismanaged the war . Kabila said on Tuesday that members of Mobutu ' s elite presidential guard were putting up a fight on the approaches to Zaire ' s southern second city Lubumbashi . The guard themselves said they had pushed back rebels there . The thud of what military experts said was heavy artillery could be heard on Wednesday in the deserted streets of Lubumbashi , coming from several km ( miles ) to the south , after noon local time ( 1000 GMT ) . It died away quickly . Gunfire was also heard . Expatriate and business sources in the city said contacts in the town of Likasi , 120 km ( 75 miles ) away to the northwest on a main railway line , reported it had fallen to the rebels on Tuesday night . Zambian sources in Ndola , near the Zairean border , said the rebels also seized the town of Sakania just across the frontier and some 200 km ( 120 miles ) from Lubumbashi on Wednesday .

Milosevic sees progress at summit with Izetbegovic . Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Paris on Thursday and said their talks , aimed at normalising post - war relations and shoring up the fragile Dayton peace process , had gone well . The former enemies held two hours of direct talks - - posing together for photographers at opposite ends of a long Louis XV sofa . They then had separate meetings with President Jacques Chirac and were due to share lunch with the French leader and international mediator Carl Bildt before a joint news conference , French officials said . Diplomats said they were likely to announce agreement to exchange diplomatic missions and restore transport and telecommunications links . Milosevic told reporters the first talks at the Hotel de Marigny state guesthouse beside the Elysee presidential palace : " went well . " Bildt , the chief international civilian representative in Bosnia , told reporters : " I expect them to take further steps towards the full normalisation of relations , further steps towards the establishment of diplomatic relations . They may not be able to take the full step ( today ) but I hope they will move significantly in that direction . " Bosnian vice - president Ejup Ganic said Izetbegovic ' s meeting with Chirac had also gone well and they had agreed to intensify economic cooperation and political consultation between France and the war - shattered former Yugoslav republic . Savouring a rare trip outside Serbia in the week that U . N . trade sanctions against rump Yugoslavia were finally lifted , Milosevic took a stroll up the celebrated Champs - Elysees avenue on Wednesday night to the Arc de Triomphe monument , flanked by two bodyguards and two French security men . But in a sign of coolness , Chirac avoided coming out to greet the Serbian leader in the courtyard of the Elysee palace for the traditional photo opportunity . Bildt said he hoped the presidents would set aside differences over a Bosnian lawsuit against Serbia and agree on a quick exchange of diplomatic missions - - almost one year late according to the Dayton timetable . Both sides are also keen to rebuild economic links , he said . The two presidents signed an agreement in Dayton , Ohio , last November recognizing each other ' s countries as sovereign states within current borders and agreed " urgently " to establish diplomatic relations and open embassies in respective capitals . Sarajevo ' s lawsuit against Belgrade in March , 1993 before the International Court of Justice in The Hague over alleged Serbian aggression against Bosnia has stalled the process , Serbian government sources say . The former Yugoslav federal army supported the Bosnian Serbs when they rose against the Bosnian Moslem and Croat bid for independence in 1992 . Belgrade told Sarajevo last Friday that diplomatic relations can not be established with the lawsuit still going on , but Bosnian officials said they would press the case . Milosevic was instrumental in securing the Dayton peace accord by forcing recalcitrant Serb leaders to the negotiating table . But his job did not end in Dayton and the West expects him to rein in Serb members of the future joint Bosnian government who pay lip service to Dayton while making no secret of separatist desires . The West wants the three main players in the Balkan crisis - - Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia - - to normalise relations as soon as possible as a guarantee for stability in the Balkans and a deterrrent against any nationalist drives to break up Bosnia . Yugoslavia and Croatia recognized each other on August 23 .

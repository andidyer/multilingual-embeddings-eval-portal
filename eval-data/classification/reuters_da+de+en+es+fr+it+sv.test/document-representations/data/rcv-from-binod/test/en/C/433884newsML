Dutch PTT says costs brake telecom op profits . Dutch post and telecoms group PTT Nederland said its telecom activities boosted sales by 9 . 3 percent in 1996 , but that growth in operating profits were braked by rising costs . Telecoms turnover rose to 14 . 28 billion , particularly reflecting growth in national telephony and mobile telecommunications , it said . Operating profit rose 8 . 7 percent to 3 . 46 billion guilders . " The result was pressured by increased operational costs , as seen across the telecoms market worldwide , " KPN said in a statement . Costs of materials and work outsourced to third parties rose particularly strongly , partly reflecting increased sales in mobile telecommunications and peripherals , but also due to high costs of new activities such as guides and cards , KPN said . The group earlier reported 1996 net profit of 2 . 46 billion guilders , up from 2 . 26 billion a year earlier . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

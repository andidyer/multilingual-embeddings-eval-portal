SAP slips , but analysts say market intact . German business software group SAP AG slipped in the third quarter , causing a slow - down in its turbulent growth , but industry analysts said on Wednesday the company would not be down for long . The company that has soared through several years of stellar growth reported an unexpectedly sharp slow - down in the expansion of revenues in the first nine months of the year , unleashing a pounding of its shares on the stock market . SAP chairman Dietmar Hopp in a telephone interview was at a loss to explain why revenue growth slowed to 33 percent from 38 percent in June , but indicated that optimistic forecasts for the client - server software market could be exaggerated . " That conclusion seems justifiable if you also consider developments at other companies like Oracle , " said Hopp . " But we don ' t want to jump to conclusions now and say the market isn ' t as big as we thought . It ' s just that booked orders were down in the last quarter . The market is still strong . " But some of SAP ' s faithful apparently got the jitters after the company issued a profit warning on the weaker growth . SAP shares were pounded in pre - bourse trade , falling as much as 26 percent and dragging down the DAX index of 30 blue - chips . The company ' s preference shares , which are listed in the DAX index , closed floor trade at 212 marks , down 24 percent from the previous day ' s close . Forecasts for the market for client - server business applications - - computer programmes that control core processes of companies and hook up their far - flung operations to central computers - - vary widely . Industry analysts said that SAP was trying to portray its stumbling in the third quarter more as a market factor than as another sign of growing pains at the burgeoning company . " It is completely realistic that we will see annual growth of around 34 percent worldwide in client - server technology , " said Helmut Guembel , a former Gartner Group analyst who set up a company called Strategy Partners International in Munich . " The problem is not in the market , it ' s at SAP , " he added . There are plenty of reasons to the expect client - server applications market , one of the swiftest technology sectors at the moment , to continue along its path of steady growth . Companies around the world , public administrations and banks will all make major adjustments when Europe adopts the " Euro " at the end of the century as its single currency . There is also the Millenium problem , the fact that existing computer operating systems cannot recognise the year 2000 , but instead read it as 0000 , a zero hour that will wreak havoc on corporate computer systems . These two factors alone , analysts say , are creating huge demand for software fixes that only client - server systems can supply across a company ' s entire network . " There will be a huge boost in growth in 1998 and 1999 if only because of the Euro and the Year 2000 problem , " said Guembel . While most large companies in SAP ' s main markets have either made the leap to client - server technology or are about to , there is still a huge market of so - called second - tier companies that have not yet made the leap . " This is certainly no weakness in the market or in SAP products but rather at SAP . This is just a blip , " said Heinz Steffen of Kleinwort Benson Research , the investment banking arm of Dresdner Bank . " But the market has lost some confidence and it will take a quarter or two before it returns . There is still some potential for the share to fall , " he added . Some of SAP ' s competitors have reported strong growth . PeopleSoft of the United States said on Tuesday that earnings in the first nine months of the year rose $ 0 . 64 per share from $ 0 . 33 per share a year ago . Baan NV of the Netherlands was expected to report its earnings later on Wednesday .

Three soldiers arraigned in U . S . Army sex scandal . Lawyers for three career soldiers accused of sexual misconduct in the U . S . Army ' s biggest sex scandal asked a military judge on Friday to slap a gag order on military leaders , saying the top officials had made their clients seem guilty before they were tried . The lawyers made their charge during the soldiers ' first court appearence - - an arraignment hearing at the sprawling Aberdeen Proving Ground Military Base - - since the scandal broke last month . Secretary of the Army Togo West had accused the men of abusing their power and ordered all soldiers to undergo sexual harassment training so they could learn about the army ' s policy toward sexual harassment - - " zero tolerance . " The defendants , a captain charged with rape , a sergeant charged with raping five women , and another sergeant charged with adultery , seemed sombre as they appeared before Military Judge Linda Webster , a lieutenant colonel . They called her " ma ' am " when they addressed her . Following military court tradition , the three deferred entering pleas until the trials actually started . The three soldiers were accused of sexually abusing women soldier trainees under their command . As a result of the charges against them , the base here set up a hotline for other women soldiers to call - in incidences of abuse , and the story has been featured widely in the media . Lawyers for Capt . Derrick Robertson and Sgts . Delmar Simpson and Nathanael Beech accused the military chain of command as having made comments and taken actions that appear to pre - judge the cases and making it difficult for their clients to receive a fair trial . " There has been an orchestrated release of information by the secretary of the army ( and others ) . This has been unprecedented in my 11 years in the military . There has even been the setting up of a hotline to report sexual abuse , " Capt . Roberston ' s attorney Jerome Murphy told Judge Webster . He said it has placed his client in a untenable position . He added that the three cases were completely separate , and yet the three men were treated as if they were co - defendants . " There was no conspiracy . There is no linking of the three , " he said , with the judge agreeing . He asked Webster to slap a gag order on the secretary of the army , the secretary of defence and even the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , but she wondered whether she had such power and deferred her judgment . However , she did order that prospective jurors in the three cases be barred from talking about the case , reading about it , or watching anything about it on television . Vincent Aballone , the lawyer for Beech , told the judge the charges against his client were minor compared to the charges against the other two and asked , " Why has the army chosen to publicise this case ? " He added that the pretrial publicity hinted at unlawful command influence . Beech is charged with adultery for having consensual sex with a private who was under his command and also asking her to write a test paper for him .

UK insurers gear up for H1 results . A busy time looms for the insurers next week , with four companies reporting first half figures . Willis Corroon Group Plc kicks off the results on Tuesday , Commercial Union Plc and Prudential Corp Plc Wednesday and Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group Plc Thursday . Question marks still hang over Willis ' long term strategy and despite its repeated denials , speculation the insurance broker needs to do something dramatic to close the gap with U . S . rivals has refused to die . No major announcements are expected next week but Willis is sure to be questioned closely about the recent tie - up with France ' s largest independent insurance broker Gras Savoye & Cie , in which it took a one third stake . Willis has repeatedly brushed off the possibility of a merger with its slightly larger UK rival Sedgwick as a solution to slim margins and elusive growth , currently characteristic of the broking industry . Intense competition is keeping pressure on premiums in most markets with few signs so far of this improving . The pound ' s continuing strength is another negative and analysts expect profits to slip to around the 60 million stg mark . Currency strength is also likely to keep a cap on profits at composite insurer Commercial Union . But a steady rise in the proportion of revenues from more robust life assurance activities - now around 50 percent - is likely to help compensate for continuing competition in the general insurance market . However , with around two - thirds of life profits earned in France and the Netherlands , the strength of the pound is likely to take the gloss of headline figures . At the first quarter stage , currency factors took 20 million stg off profits . Progress in France is expected to be monitored closely especially after two recent acqusitions there - Societe d ' Epargne Viagere ( SEV ) and UFF . Analysts expect operating profits of between 209 and 228 million stg and a dividend of the order of 12 . 25 pence . Prudential Corp is expected to report steady advances in life profits . First half new business figures released earlier this month again showed strong sales growth in its businesses around the world . Single premium life , pension and investment product sales grew 23 percent and regular premium sales by 20 percent . Its U . S . unit Jackson National Life is expected to turn in another good performance , with single premium sales up 43 percent and annuity sales 71 percent in the first half . Analysts will also be looking for news on acquisitions . The Pru has made no secret of its desire to purchase a building society to establish a high street network . Recently talks between it and National Westminster Bank were reported to have broken down amid disagreement about who would land the top jobs . Analysts are forecasting operating profits of between 426 and 468 million stg and a dividend of 6 . 3 to 6 . 4 pence . Royal & Sun Alliance brings the results for the week to a close and attention is once again likely to focus on integration progress . Profits for the company are forecast at between 417 and 465 million stg and a dividend of around 7 . 2 pence . Underwriting margins continue to be under pressure in the UK as results from Guardian Royal Exchange earlier this week confirmed . Subsidence was a feature of Royal Sun ' s first quarter figures , where a jump in claims by 10 million pounds cost the group 26 million pounds . Analysts will be looking for more details about progress on headcount reductions and the 175 million pounds of cost savings forecast at the time of the merger by 1998 . At the first quarter results , the company hinted that the eventual savings could exceed that target . North America produced a strong performance in the first quarter . A sharp fall in U . S . weather - related costs could again be a factor . A rise in the solvency ratio - the value of assets to premiums - could herald further news of buybacks or acquisitions though the company has yet to complete the repurchase of the the five percent of shares announced last year . - - Simon Cowell , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7721

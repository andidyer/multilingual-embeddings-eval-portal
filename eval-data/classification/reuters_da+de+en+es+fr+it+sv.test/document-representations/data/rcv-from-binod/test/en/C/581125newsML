Meralco falls 10 pct on heavy selling . Manila Electric Co B shares tumbled 10 percent by midsession as sellers dumped the shares on unconfirmed reports that foreigners would be allowed to invest in A shares , brokers said . The price dropped 10 percent to 108 pesos . " Investors are using the reports which came out in newspapers as an alibi to sell , " Allan Araullo , vice president of Regina Capital Development Corp , said . Local newspapers have been reporting that foreigners would be allowed to invest in A shares , which are exclusively for Filipino investors , as long as the shares are put in a trust fund managed by Philippin managers . The Securities and Exchange Commission has made no official comment on the issue . Meralco B shares were the most heavily traded stock in an otherwise timid market . The B shares went down to as low as 100 pesos in early trade . Meralco A shares , on the other hand , rose 4 . 50 pesos to 91 pesos by midsession . - - MANILA NEWSROOM ( 63 2 ) 841 - 8938 Fax 817 - 6267

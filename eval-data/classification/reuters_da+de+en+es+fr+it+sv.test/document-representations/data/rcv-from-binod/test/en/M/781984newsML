MINOR METALS BLASTS US STOCKPILE SEALED COBALT BID . Minor Metals Inc criticized the the latest sealed cobalt bid by the U . S . Defense National Stockpile Center , saying the agency didn ' t go far enough with its new independent assaying provision . The 500 , 000 - lb sealed bid , which was opened at 1300 EDT Wednesday , was the first that included a provision that said the Minor Metals Trade Association would sample and analyze 25 percent of the cobalt offered for sale . Minor Metals called attention to the provision that states that the stockpile " makes no warranty or guarantee is made that material so conforms " to the specification stated in the solicitation , in an open letter to the stockpile released Wednesday . " MMI has not been prepared to expose itself to losses arising out of quality claims , " the letter said . The stockpile " sampled 25 percent ( i . e . one keg / drum out of every four ) , " it said . " Although this is an improvement , it still leaves a buyer exposed on the balance 75 percent unsampled material . " We hope the DNSC will appreciate that no buyer ( consumer , producer , trader ) in the world is prepared to buy cobalt metal without having a quality guarantee , or , as a minimum , having the ability to sample the material first . " Minor Metals submitted a bid in Wedensday ' s offering , but attached a provision , which attached a provision that offers to cover the cost of assaying all of the drums using MMTA , but reserving the right to reject the lot " if the material does not conform to " the assay certificate . It also asked for a refund for the amount paid for the rejected lot . The bid was for 88 , 888 lbs of cobalt at $ 18 . 88 a lb . The Stockpile did not return repeated phone calls requesting comment .

Philippines set for sustained growth , says ADB . The Asian Development Bank said on Tuesday the Philippines is set for sustained growth for the next few years but pointed out " unusually large " errors in key government economic data . " Recent economic reforms , coupled with greater political stability , have produced positive economic results , " the Manila - based multilateral lending institution said in a report . " Growth has resumed , investment and exports have picked up , the balance of payments has improved , the external debt service ratio has fallen and , above all , the international investors ' confidence in the Philippine economy is now stronger than perhaps at any time in recent years , " it said . It said the country now has the potential for 6 . 0 to 7 . 0 percent annual growth for the next few years . But the report also complained of major errors in Philippine balance of payments data for 1995 , when the government announced a surplus of $ 645 million . " The balance of payments data for 1995 has unusually large negative errors and omissions of about $ 2 . 3 billion on the capital account , " the bank said . " Excluding these errors and omissions , net capital inflows in 1995 amount to about $ 4 . 9 billion , marginally higher than the $ 4 . 75 billion inflows in 1994 . " Including the errors and omissions , however , the net capital inflows amount to only about $ 2 . 6 billion , or about 45 percent lower than the 1994 level , " it said . It said the errors could have arisen from the conversion of foreign currency deposits ( FCD ) in private banks into Philippine pesos . Peso conversions or withdrawals from FCD accounts are regared as receipts under Philippine balance of payments recording practices , it said . Exporters may be placing their receipts in FCD accounts before converting them into pesos . This would then lead to a double counting of receipts as these figures are also taken from records of the Customs Department , the bank report said . It said the Philippine Central Bank had made adjustments to avoid double - counting but that other sources of error could still be present in the data . The bank said it was not possible to gauge the full extent of the miscalculation . It also said the government needed to address other issues . Privatisations , for example , had boosted government revenues since 1993 but these funds were now drying up and new sources of revenue needed to be found .

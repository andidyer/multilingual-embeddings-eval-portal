Barclays chairman comments on BZW setback . The chairman of Barclays Plc , Andrew Buxton , said on Thursday he was confident the group ' s investment banking arm BZW would be bounce back from the impact of an ongoing investigation by Britain ' s TakEover Panel . Ten days ago the panel rebuked Barclays de Zoete Wedd ( BZW ) for withholding information about fees it had been promised as it defended Northern Electric Plc from a hostile takover bid by CE Electric . After the panel intervened , CE won the bid . " BZW has a very strong underlying business and I am quite confident it can overcome temporary setbacks of this kind , " Buxton told Reuters at a presentation in London . Buxton declined to comment on specific details of BZW ' s actions , or the Northern defence , as the matter is still being investigated by the panel . Following the takeover panel ' s intervention on December 20 , after a complaint by CE , it criticised BZW for failing to fully disclose its fees and for purchasing Northern shares during the final days of the offer whilst these facts were undisclosed . It also extended CE ' s offer deadline from December 20 to December 24 and barred both BZW and Northern ' s other advisor Schroders from buying the target company ' s shares in the period . As a result of this extension , CE was able to raise its level of acceptances from just under 50 percent to 50 . 3 percent of voting shares , winning control by a margin of 300 , 000 shares . The takeover panel has said since the events that it hopes all advisors understand it wanted to send out a signal for greater disclosure by firms . Its director general Alistair Defriez said that , while the panel would not want to ban advisors from buying shares , it was concerned that purchases should be at arm ' s length " without any inducement or financial incentive from the target company " . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

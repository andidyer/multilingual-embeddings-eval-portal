Anglo says Zaire considering project bids . Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Ltd said on Friday its bids for two copper and cobalt projects in Zaire were being considered by that country ' s mining company Gecamines . Anglo tendered to develop the Kolwezi tailings project in Shaba province and had proposed a consortium with Belgium ' s Union Miniere on joint operations . Kolwezi ' s projected cobalt output was about 6 , 000 tonnes a year against world production of 20 , 000 tonnes while it would produce 80 , 000 tonnes of copper over a decade in addition to cobalt . Anglo has also submitted a tender to develop the Ruashi - Etoile copper / cobalt project near the Shaba capital Lubumbashi . The Ruashi - Etoile property is estimated to contain 62 . 5 million tonnes of ore at 3 . 45 percent copper grade and 0 . 46 percent cobalt . Anglo American spokeswoman Glenn Finnegan said tenders for the projects closed last Tuesday after Gecamines extended the deadline for submitting tenders by 30 days . " Gecamines invited all tenderers to reconsider their tenders and gave them a further 30 days to submit . The closing date for submission was Tuesday this week , April 1 . " They are under consideration at the moment , " Finnegan said . Other South African companies like Gencor Ltd , Iscor Ltd and JCI Ltd have also tendered to develop Kolwezi . Zairean rebel leader Laurant Kabila ' s soldiers have said their next target is Lubumbashi , Zaire ' s second largest city . The rebels have won control of a quarter of the vast Central African country since they launched an offensive against President Mobutu Sese Seko late last year . Mining analysts said foreign mining companies were watching the situation in Zaire nervously . " Most , though not all , of these companies have already made contact with the AFDL ( rebels ) and generally seem confident that their existing positions will be ratified , " investment analyst John Clemmow said . Other foreign companies involved in Zaire include , Barrick Gold Corp , Ashanti Goldfields Company Ltd and American Mineral Fields . - - Marius Bosch , Johannesburg newsroom , + 27 - 11 482 1003

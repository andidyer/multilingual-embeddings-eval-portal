CBOT CORN CLOSES LOWER ON WET WEATHER FORECASTS . CBOT corn futures closed lower on some weather outlooks for increased rainfall by the weekend and into next week in the U . S . Midwest , traders said . " The corn broke on improved probabilities of rain this weekend , " said Mary Colgan of Chicago - based trade house LFG Futures . Traders said Chicago television meteorologist Tom Skilling at midday put more rain in his forecast for the U . S . corn belt for the weekend . But some weather forecasts still suggest only light weekend showers for the U . S . Midwest . Weather Services Corp meteorologist Joel Burgio said there was a slight chance for heavier rains Friday and Saturday . Wednesday ' s National Weather Service six - to 10 - day outlook was for normal to above normal rain and normal to above normal temperatures in the U . S . Midwest from August 12 to August 16 . Corn closed 2 - 1 / 4 to nine cents per bushel lower , with September down nine at $ 2 . 50 and December was down 8 - 1 / 2 at $ 2 . 53 . Pressure on the September contract came from Thursday ' s USDA export sales report . USDA said net export sales of old crop 1996 - 97 ( September - August ) corn during the week ended July 31 totalled 3 , 800 tonnes , below expectations for 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 tonnes . Net export sales of new crop corn totalled 492 , 400 tonnes , above expectations for 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 tonnes . Traders said the Wednesday release of a Farmers Commodities Corp forecast for U . S . corn production failed to provide much underpinning for the market because weather forecasts were by far the dominant market factor . FCC predicted the 1997 U . S . corn crop would total 9 . 58 billion bushels , below USDA ' s July forecast for 9 . 7 billion . An average of 20 analysts ' estimates for 1997 U . S . corn production was 9 . 554 billion bushels . USDA at 0730 CDT / 1230 GMT Tuesday will release its August crop production and supply / demand reports .

Sterling edges off session highs , tracks dollar . Sterling pushed to session highs against the mark as immediate fears of a German interest rate rise faded , but edged back as it tracked a slowing dollar , traders said . The German Bundesbank finally quashed days of speculation of a rate increase when it announced it was setting its repurchase tender at an unchanged fixed rate of 3 . 00 percent . The move had little immediate impact , having been well foreshadowed on Monday evening by Buba council member Hans - Juergen Krupp declaring a rise would be " very damaging to the German economy " . But German M3 money supply figures added further reassurance . The Bundesbank , meeting on Thursday for its first council meeting since the summer break , said July M3 grew an annualised 5 . 7 percent against 1996 fourth - quarter , easier than the 6 . 4 percent growth rate in June and less robust than forecast . The pound ' s rise stopped when the dollar pulled back at a resistance level of 1 . 84 marks . Traders said short - term fears of a German rate rise , which would pull up the mark but could imperil economic recovery , would abate but speculation could soon return to the market . The pound was 2 . 9560 / 70 marks , well off session lows , but half a pfennig shy of the day ' s peak . Cable was trading near the centre of a narrow range at $ 1 . 6089 / 99 , compared to a late European level on Monday of $ 1 . 6050 . Traders said it appeared range bound between $ 1 . 60 and $ 1 . 6170 . Technical analysts said the pound appeared capped for the day in the approaches to 2 . 9650 marks , a 38 . 2 percent retracement from the multi - year high at 3 . 0878 on July 28 and the August 13 trough at 2 . 8857 . Congestion near last Tuesday ' s low would provide fair support on the downside . Avinash Persaud , head of currency research at J . P . Morgan , said the broader picture was of a declining sterling , hit by erosion of its " safe haven " status in the approach to European Monetary Union . " Sterling has benefited enormously in the past 12 months from the perception that EMU would be broad and that that would bring a weaker euro , " he said . " I think that perception is changing . " " I think the market will start to wonder if there is a weaker Europe how can the UK stand outside EMU if something like 60 percent of our trade partners will have this weak euro .

Italian separatists to hold " referendum " in north . Secessionist leader Umberto Bossi said on Saturday he expected strong backing for an unofficial " referendum " his Northern League party is to stage on Sunday , asking voters to back a separate northern state . " It will be a strong and clear signal , " Bossi said of the referendum that his separatist League will put to 22 million voters in Italy ' s 11 northern regions . Bossi , who has already declared a symbolic republic of the north called Padania , said the plebiscite would ask voters : " Do you want Padania to become an independent , sovereign federal republic ? " Bossi said that while he did not expect a huge turnout , enough voters would cast their ballots in favour of secession to force the Rome government to take the issue more seriously . " It ' s the minoritites who make history , " he told financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore in an interview . An all - party parliamentary commission on constitutional reform , which the League has pulled out of , is debating a proposal to transform Italy ' s centralised state into a federalist republic with more autonomy for the regions . Bossi blasted the proposed reform . " They are talking about a federalism that is actually a further centralisation , " he told Italian television on Saturday . " Institutional federalism must go hand in hand with fiscal federalism , " he said , adding that cities should have power over taxation and only 10 percent of tax revenue should go to the federal government . The fiery separatist said large - scale support for his referendum would bolster his cause on Monday , when he plans to argue his case for a decentralisation of the tax system in an address to the commission . " The League would be stronger and they would feel this in Rome because it would be a message from the people , " he said .

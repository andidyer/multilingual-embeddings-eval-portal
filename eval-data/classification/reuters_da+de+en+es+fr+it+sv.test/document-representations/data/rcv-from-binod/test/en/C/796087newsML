Zimbabwe farmers offered stake in cotton company . The Zimbabwean government has offered local commercial cotton growers a 10 percent stake in the national cotton firm Cottco which comes up for public sale in September , an industry official said on Wednesday . Industry sources said the government may sell up to 80 percent of the company at a price valuing the whole business at Z $ 600 million ( $ 52 million ) . Commercial Cotton Growers Association chief executive Douglas Pascoe said his organisation ' s 400 farmers do not have the 60 million ( U . S . $ 5 . 2 million ) required to take up the offer , but were negotiating with some banks to try and secure the money . " Large - scale commercial growers have been offered a 10 percent shareholding which they are going to finance . We are talking to banks and looking at ways of warehousing shares for the growers over a period of time , " Pascoe told Reuters . " The problem is people don ' t have the money . They need to fork out about 150 , 000 ( Zimbabwe ) dollars each and very few people have that kind of money , " he said . Further details of the sale of the country ' s largest cotton company are not yet available . Pascoe said commercial cotton growers welcomed Cottco ' s privatisation , adding the offer of a block equity in the company would give them some say in the marketing of the crop . " We have been subject to dictate from the ministry ( of agriculture ) . Now it ' s a commercialised company which is really reacting to markets and prevailing circumstances , " he said . " The next logical step is full privatisation . . . , " he added . Cottco used to be the country ' s sole buyer and exporter of cotton before the government loosened its grip on the marketing of some key cash crops under market - led economic reforms it started in 1991 . Now the company has been facing increasing competition from two new entrants , notably Cargill Zimbabwe , a subsidiary of U . S . commodities giant Cargill with which it has been waging a price war to win the bulk of the 1996 / 97 season ' s 250 , 000 tonnes of seed cotton . On production prospects for the 1997 / 98 season , Pascoe said the industry was worried about reports of an early buildup of the El Nino weather phenomenon which could herald drought for southern Africa . " That ' s a real threat . . . particularly more so in the communal ( peasant ) sector because they don ' t have irrigation . A severe drought will depress the whole country , " he said . But barring drought and given firmer prices on international markets , he forecast next season ' s output at 300 , 000 tonnes of seed cotton against last season ' s yield of 250 , 000 tonnes . $ 1 = 11 . 6450 - - - Harare newsroom : + 263 - 4 72 52 27 / 8 / 9 - - ( $ = 11 . 65 Zimbabwe Dollars )

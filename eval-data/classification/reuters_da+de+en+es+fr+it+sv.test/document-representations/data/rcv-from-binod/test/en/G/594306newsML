Mandela says Africa ' s renaissance time has come . South African President Nelson Mandela , who played a key role in trying to resolve the Zairean crisis , said on Monday Africa ' s renaissance is on hand , and urged its leaders to take charge of problems on the troubled continent . He told Zimbabwe ' s parliament on the first state visit to the country by a South African head of state that he was convinced Africa was on the road to realising its dreams of lasting peace , democracy , social and economic development . Mandela said patriotism demanded that African leaders strive for these goals not just in their own countries but beyond . " Thus we have striven to the best of our ability to make a contribution in finding a truly African solution to the problems in Zaire and the Great Lakes Region , " he said of his mediation efforts in Zaire . " It is given that complex problems spanning decades will not lend themselves to easy solutions . But the time has come for Africa to take full responsibility for her woes , use the immense collective wisdom it possesses to make a reality of the ideal of the African renaissance whose time has come , " he said to a round of applause . " It is a renaissance that must mean that Africa refuses to be a passive onlooker in a changing world , hapless victim to modern machinations of the forces historically responsible for her woes . " Only in this way can Africa assert her right to be an equal partner in world affairs , " he added . Mandela is widely revered here for his fight against apartheid . He is the first foreign head of state to address the 150 - member Zimbabwean parliament and was given a standing ovation at the end of his 30 - minute speech . South Africa ' s first black president was met at Harare airport by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe on Monday at the start of a three - day state visit . Mugabe praised Mandela ' s mediation efforts in Zaire , saying they met the southern African region ' s aspirations to play a bigger role in resolving African problems . Soon after his arrival Mandela attended a ceremony where the Harare City Council - - which awarded him the freedom of the city in 1990 following his release from 27 years in prison - - renamed one of the main streets Nelson Mandela Avenue in his honour .

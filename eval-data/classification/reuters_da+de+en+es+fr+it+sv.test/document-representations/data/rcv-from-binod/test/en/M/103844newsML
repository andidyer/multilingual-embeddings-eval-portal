New Zealand dollar ends lower , seen consolidating . The New Zealand dollar , rattled by Labour leader Helen Clark ' s comments that a fast - rising currency was undesirable , continued to weaken on Tuesday , although dealers said it had started to consolidate its position by the close . The Kiwi ended at US $ 0 . 6910 / 17 and at 66 . 04 on its Trade - Weighted Index , down from 0 . 6927 / 34 and 66 . 25 at the open . " It ' s consolidating around 0 . 6910 but the market got a bit scared by comments from Labour opposition leader Clark , " a dealer said . Clark , who could emerge from Saturday ' s general election the prime minister of a centre - left coalition government , told Reuters Financial Television it was undesirable for the New Zealand dollar to keep rising so fast . " I have never been an advocate of a low dollar . I think that in the end a strong dollar is a good thing . But what has been difficult for exporters is the rapid rise in the dollar , and I don ' t think it ' s desirable that it keep rising so rapidly , " she said . Dealers said while the comments had briefly spooked the market , the Kiwi had come back reasonably well on predominantly Asian buying . " While the market undoubtedly is still negative on Kiwi , there still I think is the chance for the Kiwi to consolidate close to these levels before we head lower , " the dealer said . It was seen trading a 0 . 6895 - 6925 range overnight . - - Matthew Brockett ( 64 4 ) 471 4275

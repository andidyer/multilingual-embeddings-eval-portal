ALPINE SKIING - COMPAGNONI CHASES FIRST ITALIAN WIN . The next four days could end a decade - long wait for Deborah Compagnoni , winner of two women ' s giant slaloms in Germany last week . Since her first appearance on the Alpine skiing World Cup circuit as a teenager in 1987 , the former super - giant Olympic gold medallist and reigning Olympic and world giant slalom champion has never won in her native Italy . But , free from the many injuries that have plagued her for years , recent form suggests the time has come . Cortina , the winter playground of the rich and famous in Italy , first hosts a downhill on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste on Thursday followed by a super - giant slalom on Friday and two giants at the weekend . That should give the 26 - year - old from Santa Caterina Valfurva , who leads the giant slalom World Cup standings on 360 points ahead of Austrian Anita Wachter on 320 after five races , at least three excellent chances . The resort has already had plenty of sporting success to cheer about this season as the home town of men ' s downhill star Kristian Ghedina , winner of three World Cup races , and a Compagnoni win would be the icing on the cake . " I ' m really hoping to win there , " Compagnoni said at the weekend of Cortina , where she finished second in a giant in 1994 after a third place in a giant the previous year . " I have never won in Italy before and it would be beautiful to break the ice before Sestriere . " The world championships start in the Italian resort of Sestriere on February 2 and , with a struggling Alberto Tomba largely absent from the pistes so far this season , Compagnoni and Ghedina have been keeping the hosts ' hopes high . " Deborah , perfection exists , " declared an ecstatic headline in the Gazzetta dello Sport at the weekend . Her name will not figure in Thursday ' s downhill , a race sure to renew the battle between the overall World Cup leader Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden and Germany ' s Katja Seizinger . The Swede , still chasing the first downhill win of her career , goes into the four races with a 328 point lead over the defending overall champion who prefers the speed events and should narrow the gap between the two . Wiberg has won two super - Gs and two slaloms so far this season as well as finishing third in a giant - - her best result in the discipline since 1993 - - and can also put up a good fight in downhill with a second place here last year . Germany ' s Hilde Gerg , second in a downhill in Austria earlier in the month after winning a super - G at Val d ' Isere in December , will also be looking for a first downhill win . The weather in Cortina could be a big factor in the race with Tuesday ' s downhill training postponed and then abandoned as snow and then heavy fog made any runs impossible . The forecast for Thursday is more encouraging however . Two training runs were due on Wednesday . The programme originally envisaged three races but a second giant slalom , which could not be held in the French resort of Morzine in December due to soft snow , was added .

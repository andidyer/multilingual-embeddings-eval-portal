INSIGHT - - Sterling / mark may help dlr / mark higher . The mark , depressed by prospects for a weak Euro , may be dealt another blow by the currency that has remained on the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) sidelines - - sterling , experts said . Sterling / mark closed on Monday at 2 . 8115 / 25 , up from 2 . 7999 at the open , and would add to the mark ' s negative tone if a major resistance level at 2 . 8325 gives way , they added . " Sterling / mark is just shy of the cycle high at 2 . 8325 / 30 . If that breaks , it ' s a bad sign for the mark . This would mean more mark erosion on the European crosses and versus the dollar , " said analyst Ben Morden at I . D . E . A . The next key resistance on sterling / mark is at 2 . 8375 . The mark came under heavy selling pressure on Monday after the Socialist Party won the French parliamentary elections which raised fears of a weak Euro and a weaker mark . " We don ' t have a topping pattern yet on dollar / mark , " said Morden who wanted to see " a confirmation ( of the dollar / mark rally ) first at 1 . 7389 , the high for the year on April 28 . " Late on Monday in New York , the dollar was quoted at 1 . 7280 / 85 marks versus 1 . 7265 / 75 at the open , 116 . 64 / 69 yen vs . 116 . 62 / 67 , and at 1 . 4306 / 11 Swiss francs vs . 1 . 4350 / 60 . Cable was quoted at $ 1 . 6355 / 65 vs . $ 1 . 6362 / 72 . " If we take out 1 . 7389 , then I would look to 1 . 7450 / 55 and 1 . 75 before I start tagging my hopes on the 1 . 7686 , " Morden added , referring to the dollar ' s high on February 8 , 1994 . Mark / Paris proved very volatile in the wake of the French polls , racing through key resistance at 3 . 3835 to set a new high for the year at 3 . 3860 before retreating to 3 . 3730 . Analysts said mark / Paris may try the downside , where good support awaits at 3 . 3660 , before retesting its fresh high . " You had pure technical trade on mark / Paris all the way to 3 . 3860 . Now , a more rational trade will resume , " predicted Morden who saw more mark weakness on other European crosses . Analysts said mark / Swiss dipped below 0 . 8270 but no recovery is in sight unless 0 . 8315 resistance is taken out while strong support is seen at 0 . 8255 . Mark / Spain is sitting just below a double - top at 84 . 55 while the lira should extenbt its recovery vs . the mark unless 986 . 50 goes , they added . Dollar / yen continued to grind higher toward 117 . 00 / 05 , though with less stamina than dollar / mark , noted Morden who did not rule out an attack on 117 . 85 , a 38 - percent retracement from 111 . 88 , the low on May 20 , to 127 . 47 , the May 1 high . Mark / yen was steady at 67 . 50 , in a 67 . 90 to 66 . 35 range . ( ( Isabelle Clary , 212 - 859 - 1666 ) )

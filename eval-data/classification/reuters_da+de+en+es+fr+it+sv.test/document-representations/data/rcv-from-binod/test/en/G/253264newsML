Four million U . S . children hungry - study . Four million American children under the age of 12 do not get enough to eat and 20 . 8 percent of American children under 18 live in poverty , a private research group reported on Wednesday . In a profile of food and nutrition programmes around the United States , the Food Research and Action Centre found that 8 . 3 percent of youngsters under 12 were hungry . The centre , which works for policy changes to eradicate U . S . hunger and malnutrition , based its findings on a survey it conducted in 1995 . To get a picture of how many hungry children live in the United States , the centre asked questions of adults , according to policy analyst Christin Driscoll . These included : - - " Does your household ever run out of money to pay for food ? " - - " Do you ever rely on a limited number of foods because of lack of funds ? " - - " Do you ever eat less than you want so your children can eat ? " - - " Do your children ever eat less than they feel they should ? " - - " Do your children ever skip meals ? " - - " Do your children ever say they are hungry ? " - - " Do your children ever go to bed hungry ? " The group took its poverty statistics from the U . S . Census Bureau , which figures that families of four living on $ 15 , 569 a year or less in 1995 - - the year for which statistics were taken for the center ' s report - - lived in poverty . Louisiana had the highest percentage of hungry children , 12 . 1 percent , and California , Florida and Washington D . C . had rates of child hunger above 11 percent , the study found . It found that the major federal nutrition programmes reached a significant number of poor children but it voiced concern that changes in the welfare law would undermine this . " Even now , these programmes fail to serve all who are eligible ; we fear implementation of the new welfare law will undermine the reach of the programmes in the year ahead , " the center ' s Lynn Parker said in a statement . Under welfare legislation passed by Congress this year , the group said , funding for nutrition programmes over the next six years was cut by $ 30 billion , including deep cuts in the Food Stamp Programme and the elimination of some funding for programmes that provided breakfasts for students . The Food Stamp cuts are significant because traditionally a majority of Food Stamp recipients are children , it said .

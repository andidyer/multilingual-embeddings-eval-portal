Infamous convicted killer loses N . J . appeal . [ CORRECTED 01 : 02 GMT 6 / 3 ] Robert Marshall , whose trial for plotting his wife ' s ambush and murder was chronicled in a best - selling book and television movie , lost an appeal Wednesday to reverse his conviction and death sentence . It was the second time Marshall ' s case was considered by the New Jersey Supreme Court which on automatic review earlier upheld his sentence . New Jersey has not executed anyone since 1963 , and Marshall is one of 12 death - row prisoners in the state . Marshall was convicted of arranging for two accomplices to murder his wife , Maria , in 1984 after he pulled into a rest stop on the Garden State Parkway on the way home from a night in Atlantic City . An insurance agent heavily in debt , Marshall had taken out $ 1 . 5 million in insurance policies on his wife ' s life . Joseph McGinniss ' ( corrects from Gay Talese ' s ) best - selling book , " Blind Faith , " told the Marshall story from the viewpoint of the couple ' s three sons , who were divided over the question of their father ' s guilt . It was later made into a television movie . Four justices ruled in a 222 - page opinion against Marshall ' s claim that his lawyer was ineffective in representing him during the penalty phase of the trial . They also upheld a lower court ' s ruling that Marshall ' s other claims should have been raised on direct appeal or were similar to issues that had been decided already . Two dissenting opinions said Marshall ' s claim to ineffective assistance of counsel raised an issue worth an evidentiary hearing in the trial court .

China urges faster payment of export tax rebates . Top Chinese tax officials have called for faster repayment of export tax rebates to ease capital shortages among exporters , the China Daily said on Thursday . Unpaid tax rebates totalled an estimated 20 billion yuan ( $ 2 . 4 billion ) at the end of 1996 , the newspaper quoted officials at a conference as saying . China would not introduce any major changes to policies on export taxes in 1997 and would pay all the delayed rebates by the end of the year , the newspaper said . The State Council , or cabinet , had approved a set of rules to govern tax exemptions , deductions and repayments for provincial level manufacturers and foreign trade companies acting on their behalf , it said . The regulations allowed manufacturers whose exports account for more than half of their sales and who pay more in taxes on raw materials and components than is deducted for products sold in the domestic market to have the balance refunded , it said . Foreign - funded ventures approved before December 1993 could continue to enjoy tax breaks until the end of 1998 , but would then be taxed in the same way as domestic firms , it said . Official figures showed Chinese exporters were paid 82 . 63 billion yuan in tax rebates in 1996 , up 50 . 5 percent from the year before , the newspaper said but gave no further details .

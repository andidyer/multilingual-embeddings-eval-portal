INTERVIEW - Dakota rail would mull public offering . Going public is one option Dakota , Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corp ( DM & E ) would consider to finance a $ 1 . 2 billion bid to become one of the country ' s major coal carriers . " Going public is one financing option , but I can ' t predict today that that ' s the option we would choose once all the parters have been selected , " Michael Buchanan , managing director of San Francisco - based Lombard Investments Inc , told Reuters Monday . Lombard Investments formed DM & E in 1986 and represents interests of majority institutional shareholders . DM & E , which now hauls grain and other commodities , is planning to create 250 miles of new track and rebuild 650 miles of track . Its goal is to reach the low - sulfur coal mines of Wyoming ' s Powder River Basin - - one of the richest coal deposits in the world - - and bring the coal to customers in Minnesota , Wisconsin and elsewhere in the Midwest and along the Mississippi River . The company is searching for one or more strategic partners for the project and will seek to raise funding once partners are picked . " We ' ve had a lot of expressions of interest . We ' re more in the stage of selecting a partner than finding one , " chief executive Kevin Schieffer said . Schieffer said the market for Powder River Coal , which is less environmentally harmful because of its low sulfur content , is now 300 million tons a year . Based on conservative estimates , this should grow to 400 million tons or more by 2002 and 500 million tons by 2007 , he said . He said DM & E needs to capture five percent of this market to break even on its venture . DM & E hopes to have 10 percent of the market by 2002 and 20 percent of the market by 2007 , Schieffer said . Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp and Union Pacific Corp now both haul coal from the Powder River Basin . Buchanan said diversified energy companies , railroads and utilities who are potential customers have come forward as possible partners . Buchanan said DM & E would also consider a consortium of companies coming together as a partner and the likeliest candidates would be large , publicly - traded companies . " My guess is that . . . we will have the partner group identified by year - end , " he said .

" As EGS , our main aim is to help our group companies ' foreign trade operations and finance problems . We do not directly make exports and imports , but we give foreign trade and financing services to our shareholders , " Akcay said . He said they channelled short - term export loans secured mainly from Turkish Eximbank to the group companies . " We are placing around $ 50 - 60 million worth export loans secured from the Eximbank and banking sector to group companies . But this is not enough and other units like EGS Bank , leasing and factoring companies also provide financial support from within the group , " Akcay added . EGS Dis Ticaret aims to retain its share of around 10 percent in Turkey ' s textile and clothing exports .

Akcay said Turkey ' s textile industry would continue to expand with its existing potential which grew in recent years with strong investments and human resources . " This sector lost its dynamism in Europe , but it is growing in Turkey on which we base our long - term projections . Turkey should sell its own brand rather than sub - contracting for other foreign brands , " he said . He added that EGS Dis Ticaret sought new international marketing opportunities and planned to open shops in and outside Turkey to sell the group ' s products . The company also plans to build a shopping mall in Istanbul this year and later in Denizli , Izmir and Ankara . Turkish textile exports , led by clothing items totalled $ 8 . 79 billion in 1996 , down from $ 9 billion the previous year , according to the reilable but unofficial data released by the leading exporters body TIM . Textile exporters have blamed an overvalued Turkish lira in 1996 as well as higher prices of raw materials and other inputs for the decline in textile exports . - - Istanbul newsroom + 90 - 212 - 275 08 75

TENNIS - SWISS OPEN TRIUMPH GIVES MANTILLA SECOND WIN IN A ROW . Spain ' s Felix Mantilla swept aside compatriot Juan Albert Viloca in the final of the Swiss Open on Sunday to claim his second consecutive tournament win . Mantilla , who lost last year ' s final to compatriot Albert Costa , made no mistake his second time around , disposing of Viloca 6 - 1 6 - 4 6 - 4 in just 90 minutes . The victory gave the 21 - year - old Spaniard back - to - back tournament wins , following his triumph over French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten in the Bologna final last month . Mantilla ' s third career victory also marked the sixth time in seven years that a Spaniard had walked away with the Swiss title . " I played well and made no mistakes , " said Mantilla , who had lost four previous career finals against fellow Spaniards . " This has been one of my best weeks of tennis in my life , in the future I hope there will be a few more like it . " Mantilla , the sixth seed , never let a nervous Viloca , who was playing in his first career final , into the match . Viloca , who managed to hold his serve just once in the first set , offered some resistance in the second but lost any momentum he had been building up when Mantilla , ranked 16 in the world , broke him in the opening game of the third . " My semifinal match yesterday was very tough and today my legs were very heavy , " said Viloca , ranked at a career - high 67 . " The first set he ( Mantilla ) played great tennis and after I lost the second set I didn ' t think it was possible to win . " Despite the loss the week was one full of firsts for Viloca , who will now have his name added to a seemingly endless list of talented Spanish clay courters . On the way to his first career final , Viloca recorded his first ever win over a top 10 player when he disposed of number nine Marcelo Rios in the second round and followed up with a victory over world number six Alex Corretja in the semifinals .

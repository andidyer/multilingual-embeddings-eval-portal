Chinese labor activist wants to remain in China . China ' s outspoken labor activist Han Dongfang , now living in exile in Hong Kong , has told Newsweek magazine he is willing to give up his freedom to remain in China . In an interview in the latest edition of the weekly Newsweek magazine , released a day ahead of publication on Sunday , Dongfang said : " If I can find a way to stay in China , then maybe I can give up something else , including my freedom . " Dongfang was jailed for his role in the 1989 democracy movement and released after 22 months for medical treatment in the United States . He returned to China in 1993 but was expelled and is currently living in Hong Kong with a canceled Chinese passport waiting to see what will happen to him on July 1 when China regains sovereignty over the British colony , Newsweek said . In the interview Dongfang urged any political dissidents still left in Hong Kong who are trying to gain asylum in third countries to do so before June 30 . " If those people stay in Hong Kong , they will be in trouble , " Dongfang said . " The Communist Party can never forget people who say something bad against it . If ( its leaders ) have the chance ( to arrest dissidents ) , they have to do it , to teach them and others never to do these things . For their safety , ( dissidents ) had better leave Hong Kong before that day . "

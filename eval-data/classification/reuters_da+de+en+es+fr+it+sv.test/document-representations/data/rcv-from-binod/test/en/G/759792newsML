Models , slogans , cookery herald China new military . Plastic models , political exhortations and a prize - winning army chef were all on show on Monday as China hailed its rapidly - modernising armed forces with an exhibition on development in the world ' s largest military . Authorities launched the Exhibition on New - Era Construction of the People ' s Liberation Army last week as a showcase celebrating the three - million - strong PLA ' s advance towards mastery of the hardware and tactics of modern warfare . While displays lauded China ' s new appliance of military science , politics were also much on display - - with a high profile given to the thoughts and words of President Jiang Zemin , a leader who has worked hard to win military loyalties . Plastic models of the navy ' s newest frigates and the air force ' s fastest fighter planes were the closest visitors got to the kind of advanced PLA weaponry that has sent shivers through security circles in the Asia - Pacific region . Much was made of the role played by the former revolutionary red army , which celebrates its 70th birthday on August 1 , in anti - poverty campaigns , sheep - tending and fire - fighting . Even army chef Li Chunxiang was given a small display showing off his skills at carving water melons . " China has made a lot of progress in modernising its military , " said one soldier from the PLA ' s Beijing garrison assigned to help staff the exhibition . " Of course some of the most advanced stuff is not on show here because it is secret , " he said . Military analysts say China ' s military modernisation programme has been given a huge boost by generals and leaders shocked by the display of military might put on by Western nations during the 1991 Gulf War . While much of the nation ' s armed forces remain relatively backward , pockets of excellence have been developed among its nuclear , naval and air force arms - - and Beijing has vowed to attract overseas investment to help develop new weapons . The prospect of a PLA able to project its power far beyond China ' s borders has raised concerns among regional neighbours , many of whom have lingering border disputes with Beijing . High - technology training was a vital part of the development of a modern military , said one officer at the exhibition as he showed off a display of computer simulators designed to hone the skills of pilots , tank commanders and warship crews . A virtual - reality simulator with a three - dimensional headset allowed trainee aviators to practise in - flight refuelling - - a skill that would give China ' s warplanes new regional clout - - with what staff called total realism . " It ' s just like the real thing , " said the officer , who declined to be identified . " You can even use it to play golf . " Most visitors to the exhibition in Beijing ' s Soviet - style military museum flocked to video screens showing missile launches or mock air - assaults , but some displays seemed more about commerce than combat . Slick Western suits and popular headache tablets produced by military - run ventures illustrated the economic clout and profit - making prowess of the PLA ' s vast business empire . Despite the clear technical transformation achieved by the PLA in its 70 - year journey from peasant - backed militia to modern - day military , not all visitors were impressed . " Actually , I feel our military development has been a bit too slow , " said one 24 - year - old Beijing entrepreneur . " Overall , the weapons are not so advanced . . . we should develop faster .

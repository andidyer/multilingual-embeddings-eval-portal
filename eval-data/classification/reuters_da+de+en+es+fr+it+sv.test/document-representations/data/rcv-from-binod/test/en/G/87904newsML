Armenian vote loser shows up on Russian TV . The defeated candidate in Armenia ' s presidential election , who has been in hiding from the authorities since last week , appeared on Russian television on Tuesday to deny accusations of fomenting violence . " I am not in favour of chaos in the country , " Vazgen Manukyan said in a clandestine interview given to Russian Television . " In fact I am in favour of political decisions . " Supporters of Manukyan , once President Levon Ter - Petrosyan ' s prime minister , accuse the head of state of rigging the results of the vote on September 22 to secure a second five - year term . International observers say there were irregularities . Ter - Petrosyan moved tanks onto the streets of Yerevan to restore order in the capital after two days of demonstrations . Manukyan , who the authorities say incited his supporters to storm the parliament building , has been in hiding for nearly a week . Many of his allies have been reportedly detained by security forces on charges of provoking public disorder . The Russian Television reporter said Manukyan gave the interview at a secret address in Yerevan . " He arrived five minutes before us and left first after making sure he was not followed , " the correspondent said . " He left no address to contact him . " " Manukyan said he will never surrender to the authorities , " he added . Diplomats and opposition politicians have said that up to 250 people have been detained since the unrest , some of whom had nothing to do with the protest . Others have gone into hiding . The Armenian interior ministry denied large - scale arrests . Wives and relatives of people who had been arrested sent an appeal to the United Nations over the weekend demanding it put pressure on the government to release political detainees .

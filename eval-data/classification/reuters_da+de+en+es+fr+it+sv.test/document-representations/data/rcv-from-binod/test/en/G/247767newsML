Islamic ministers lay out views on Moslem issues . Islamic countries laid out their views on issues affecting the Moslem world on Tuesday at the annual foreign ministerial meeting of the 54 - member Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( IOC ) . Conference sources said one of the most contentious issues was likely to arise in the political affairs committee , with Kuwait expected to propose a resolution hostile to Iraq , which Baghdad would strongly oppose . The conference was also expected to endorse a resolution condemning Aremenia for " aggression " against Azerbaijan and calling for the withdrawal of Armenian troops and the " liberation " of occupied Azerbaijani territory . The five - day conference opened on Monday with an attack on Israel over what speakers said was its " reneging " on agreements with the Palestinians , and calls for Moslem unity and economic cooperation and development . It is also seeking to dispel an image among some in the West equating Islam with violence and terrorism . The conference ' s Cultural and Islamic Affairs Committee is studying resolutions that include ways to unify Moslems in the defence of Islamic values . Ministers also met their counterparts for bilateral discussions on the sidelines of the conference . Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had a session on Tuesday with Afghanistan ' s Rahim Gafoorazai , who is deputy foreign minister in the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani . Rabbani was driven from Kabul in September by the purist Islamic Taleban militia , and is now allied with ethnic Uzbek leader Rashid Dostum in a bid to retake the capital . The OIC has left Afghanistan ' s seat vacant while urging the warring Afghan parties to form a government of national unity .

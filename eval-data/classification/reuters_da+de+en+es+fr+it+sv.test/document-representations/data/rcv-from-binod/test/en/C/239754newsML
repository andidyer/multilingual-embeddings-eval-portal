FEATURE - Russian banks join ADR bandwagon . Russian banks are joining a select group of industrial companies by issuing American Depositary Receipts on Western capital markets , but bankers said the deals would achieve little more for banks other than brightening their image . Whether the ADR issues will help develop the illiquid market in Russian banking shares is unclear . " The possibility of issuing ADRs will stimulate the Russian market , its liquidity , quotes and confidence in the stocks , " Sergei Malinin , head of the securities market at MAKB Vozrozhdeniye , one of three banks planning an ADR issue , told Reuters . But Alexander Balatsky , an analyst from Unitrust brokerage , which specialises in banking shares , said ADR issues would do little to help develop the market . " Vozrozhdeniye is the only bank of the three which tries to support the domestic market for its shares . Now Russian brokers will have a possibility of arbitrage , " he said . " What ' s to be done with Menatep and Inkombank , which do not even have market - makers here , is unclear . " Vozrozhdeniye and two other big banks , AB Inkombank and Bank Menatep , recently received permission from Russia ' s central bank to sell their level - one ADRs to foreign investors . BANKING SHARES ILLIQUIDThe market in bank shares in Russia is almost illiquid and the only really traded share is that of state - owned Sberegatelny Bank RF , Russia ' s biggest bank , with a dominant position in the household savings market . Even its shares are not traded on the Russian Trading System , an electronic market resembling the U . S . NASDAQ system , and which accounts for the bulk of Russian share trading . Most interest in the market appears at the end of the year , when banks pay dividends , share analysts said . ADRs issued by industrial companies have had a significant impact on the domestic market of their shares . Such shares have often outperformed the market , not least because the Russian companies involved must become more open to investors , eventually adopting Western - style accounting standards . ADRs allow foreign investors to trade overseas shares without settlement and custody problems in the issuer ' s market . Level - one ADRs give investors access to a company ' s shares but do not raise new capital . For this level - two or level - three ADRs must be issued , for which the U . S . authorities set stricter reporting requirements . But even news about a forthcoming ADR issue by a Russian company is enough to push up its share price . FIRST DEAL WITH RUSSIAN BANK ADRS SEEN IN DECEMBERThe first deal with Inkombank ' s ADRs will happen in the week beginning December 9 , a bank spokesman said , adding that in 1997 or 1998 Inkombank would issue level three and level two ADRs . All three banks received permission from the U . S . Securities and Exchange Commission to issue ADRs but could not sell their shares to foreigners without central bank approval for each deal . But the central bank limited all three to selling no more than three percent of their authorised capital in ADRs , although they had applied for more . Vozrozhdeniye , for example , applied for 15 percent of its capital to be issued in ADRs , about the volume currently traded in Russia , Malinin said . He said he was disappointed by the limit . " It will only boost our image and is another chance to promote ourselves - - you cannot do anything more with three percent , " he said . CENTRAL BANK TO LIMIT ADRSThe central bank said it would minimise the amount of ADRs or Global Depositary Receipts issued by banks as they deprive the Russian market of capital . " Our goal is to develop the Russian market , not the American one , " said a central bank expert , who asked not to be named . " We do not have enough information about the American market while on our part the legal status of ADRs is not fully worked out . " The three percent limit rules out ADRs as a vehicle for attracting strategic investors . But Inkombank vice - president Rafael Nagapetyants said the mere fact his bank ' s ADRs would appear in the West was positive . " Our goal is to feel the market , to set up quotes . For us to have quotes in the West is of major importance , " he said , adding that Inkombank already had underwriters ' applications for the whole issue .

U . S . warns of tragedy if Zaire war reaches capital . The United States said on Monday it would be a " crime and a terrible tragedy " if Zaire ' s civil war reached the capital Kinshasa . State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters Washington was urging the rebels led by Laurent Kabila and the governnment of President Mobutu Sese Seko to resume negotiations in South Africa . " We believe . . . that it would be a crime and a terrible tragedy to see the civil war continue , because what happens is that innocent people are killed , " Burns said . " So if there ' s a way to resolve the civil war peacefully through negotiations in South Africa , we think that ' s far better than having the rebels advance on Kinshasa , as they appear intent on doing . " Zaire ' s warring sides met in South Africa last week and said they agreed on the need for a ceasefire and democratic elections . There is no sign of a quick resumption of talks . The United States signalled on Wednesday that Mobutu should step down , effectively ending a decades - old alliance with the African strongman . Burns said the United States was still braced for a possible evacuation of about 450 Americans from the country . About 1 , 400 U . S . Marines are stationed offshore in case the call to evacuate was made . Asked how the United States would work with a Kabila government should he come to power , Burns said : " Mr . Kabila does not have much of a track record as a leader of a government . In fact , he ' s never led a government . " His ideology in the past has been - - has been authoritarian in many respects - - his devotion to Marxist - Leninist principles . We ' ll deal with him as we can . " He added : " We ' ll try to do our very best in influencing him to be an open leader , if he does become a leader . But right now , that ' s not for us to decide . That ' s for the Zairean people to decide , and I can ' t predict the result of the political struggle in Zaire itself . " Burns appealed to Rwanda to urgently allow back tens of thousands of starving Rwandan Hutus who were huddled in camps south of Kisangani in Eastern Zaire . " This could be handled easily . Surely they ( the Rwandan authorities ) can allow the women and children out , and then , perhaps , allow the men to go overland to be screened at ( the border town ) Goma , " Burns said .

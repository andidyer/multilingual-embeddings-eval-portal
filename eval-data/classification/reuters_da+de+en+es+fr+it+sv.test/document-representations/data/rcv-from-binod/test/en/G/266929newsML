Tense calm descends on site of Peru hostage crisis . Following the spectacular storming of the Japanese ambassador ' s residency in the Peruvian capital , a tense calm descended on Thursday on the middle - class neighbourhood where leftist rebels held hundreds of hostages . Nearly a day and a half after the Havana - inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movment ( MRTA ) guerrillas boldly interrupted a lavish party at the ambassador ' s home , a waiting and guessing game replaced the initial drama . Heavily armed police , reporters and family members settled in for what most felt would be a long vigil . All attention was focused on the quiet 250 yard ( meter ) stretch of the Thomas Edison Street outside the building in the San Isidro neighbourhood close to Lima ' s Pacific coast . No sounds could be heard from the white , nondescript residency . Red and white tents , where the party to commemorate the Japanese Emperor ' s birthday was being held , could just be seen over the high walls that surround the property . Reporters , diplomats and family members camped out at either end of the tree - lined street tried to snatch a few precious minutes of sleep before dawn . Small groups discussed in low voices the likely endgame of the standoff . Would the government persist with negotiations or would it try to take the building by storm ? " They can ' t give in to the guerrillas ' demands because if they set free all of the prisoners , we will go back to 10 years of subversion and 10 years of terrorism , " said security guard Juan Pozo at a nearby apartment block . But family members were anxious to see more immediate action . " They will start to kill people . The government must do something , please , " said Elizabeth Canales , who was released with a group of about 80 women and elderly people late Tuesday but whose husband remained inside . The rebels - holding up to 484 people captive including many high - ranking diplomats , businessmen and government officials - have demanded release of 400 to 500 jailed comrades and the presence of President Alberto Fujimori for talks . Police presence was restrained with groups of five or ten posted on street - corners . No snipers could be seen on the roofs of surrounding buildings . Police ringing the roads around the residency , wrapped in bullet - proof vests and armed with automatic rifles , paced nervously , smoking cigarrettes and talking quietly among themselves . " What ' s the latest news ? Are they still negotiating ? " one young policeman asked a reporter as he passed through a checkpoint . Behind the ambassador ' s home , about 30 ambulances were parked , ready for any eventuality . " We ' ll all be here until the end no matter what happens , " said ambulance driver Eduardo Vargas . " Let ' s hope that it does not end in bloodshed . " Others were less optimistic . " They ( the guerrillas ) know that they ' re already dead men . They won ' t come out quietly , " said taxi driver Jorge Carvajal . The Japanese ambassador ' s neighbours clearly feared the worst and headed for safety long ago . Houses and apartments around the residency were deserted with only the occasional Christmas lights still flashing . In the quiet backstreets , lines of cars with diplomatic plates waited , their occupants often asleep . Occasionally a small group would approach the yellow police tape blocking off the street outside the residency , gaze forlornly at the scene and return to their cars . The world ' s press , here in force , busied themselves arranging satellite links and seeking better views . The local press , starved of information , took to interviewing one another .

U . S . expects African U . N . candidates shortly . The United States said on Tuesday it expected that African countries that have hitherto supported the re - election of Boutros Boutros - Ghali as U . N . Secretary - General would put forward other candidates in the next few days . The State Department said a letter from the head of the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) , Cameroon President Paul Biya , suggesting to African leaders they could submit other candidates was " an important step forward . " Washington has sought the ouster of Boutros - Ghali , an Egyptian , after a single five - year term , charging that he has not done enough to reform the United Nations . It has said it will give priority to another African candidate . The United States vetoed Boutros - Ghali ' s re - election in the Security Council last month , despite being in a 14 - 1 minority . But until Biya ' s letter was published on Tuesday , African states continued to back the Egyptian solidly . " We have said that African countries should present qualified candidates to the Security Council , and that is exactly what President Biya ' s letter calls upon them to do , " State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters . " We now expect that a number of African countries will finally put forward in the next several days candidates for election to the post of Secretary - General . " But at the United Nations , African ambassadors said on Tuesday no new names would be submitted at this time . " Secretary - General Boutros - Ghali is still Africa ' s candidate , " said Sierra Leone ambassador James Jonah after a meeting of more than 50 African U . N . envoys . Burns said Washington hoped the process could move forward rapidly so that the Security Council could make a recommendation for General Assembly action by Dec . 17 , the date the Assembly intends to go out of session . " The United States has no candidate of its own at this time . . . Our only wish is that the candidate will have as the central priority for his or her mandate the reform of the United Nations itself . . . both on a budgetary basis and a management basis and a diplomatic basis , " he said . Burns said a number of countries had already come forward informally with candidates . He gave no names , but other U . S . officials said they included Senegalese Foreign Minister Moustapha Niasse , Ivory Coast Foreign Minister Amara Essy , U . N . Under - Secretary General Kofi Annan of Ghana and OAU Secretary - General Salim A . Salim of Tanzania .

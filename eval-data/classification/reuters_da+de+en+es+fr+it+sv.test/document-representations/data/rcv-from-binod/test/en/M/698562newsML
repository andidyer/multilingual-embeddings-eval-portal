Polish bond yields seen up as interest dwindles . Poland ' s 15 - percent two year and 12 - percent five year fixed bond yields are expected to rise significantly on small investor demand at Wednesday ' s joint one billion zloty primary tender , dealers said on Tuesday . They said uncertainty over the government ' s will to impose tighter fiscal discipline and lingering questions over Poland ' s expanding current account gap , which some said could spark a Czech - style crisis next year , would keep foreigners at bay . " Neither investors nor domestic banks want to buy bonds , as they are not liquid and because the zloty is not likely to strengthen amid a widening C / A gap , " said Wojciech Kowalczyk , senior dealer at Bank Handlowy SA . Dealers expected yields on the two - year paper to approach 22 percent against last month ' s primary tender 21 . 23 percent . They said the five year paper , last yielding 18 . 55 percent , should also rise by some 0 . 2 point on Wednesday . Some said however , that the finance ministry would probably reject the vast majority of bids if prices were too low . " Demand for the five year - paper will be very small as foreigners , who in the past bought most of this paper , are more interested in slowly selling Polish paper , " said Krzysztof Kozuchowski , dealer at ING Bank in Warsaw . Dealers said the zloty ' s nearly one percentage point fall against the basket since last Thursday would not spark much interest in fixed bonds as foreigners were reluctant to place new funds into Poland ahead of September parliamentary elections . " Foreigners may wait until after the elections before buying Polish paper because many do not believe that politicians would make unpopular decisions on tightening the fiscal policy before the polls , " said Maciej Kwiatkowski of Societe Generale . - - Wojciech Moskwa + 48 22 653 9700

A . M . Best affirms AmerUs Life rating . A . M . Best Co said it has affirmed the " A " rating of AmerUs Life Insurance Co and the " A " rating of Delta Life & Annuity Co . Best said its action follows the announcement that AmerUs Life Holdings Inc , parent of AmerUs Life , has agreed to acquire Delta Life Corp , parent of Delta Life & Annuity Co . AmerUs will fund the about $ 186 million purchase through a combination of internal funds and a revolving line of credit . These affirmations follow an evaluation of the financial terms , structure and strategic synergies of the transaction . AmerUs Life was the first mutual life insurance company to restructure as a mutual insurance holding company , thereby providing it with access to capital markets for funding new business growth and potential mergers and acquisitions . The acquisition of Delta is the first transaction following the $ 100 million initial public offering by AmerUs Life and the $ 86 million preferred stock issued earlier in 1997 . A . M . Best said it views the transaction as favorable based on the consolidated financial strength and operating performance of AmerUs and its subsidiary , American Vanguard Life Insurance Co . The strategic value of Delta ' s existing 3 , 500 PPGA ' s ( Personal Producing General Agent ) annuity business will benefit AmerUs by providing new annuity and life business production potential . AmerUs Life has an excellent persistency level in its individual life segment , due to the product ' s good dividend performance , the generally stable character of the book of business , and the company ' s above average agent retention . Reduced expenses from new business and product support systems should enable the company to improve its earnings . In addition , a new variable product joint venture should expand the product portfolio and provide a source of additional earnings . The rating affirmation of Delta Life & Annuity is contingent upon the timely completion of the proposed transaction , Best said . A delay or non - closure of this proposed transaction would cause the rating of Delta Life & Annuity to be placed under review . The transaction is expected to be completed following regulatory and board approval in the fall of 1997 . ( ( - - New York Newsdesk 212 859 - 1610 ) )

Aluminium , after failing on the upside Thursday , could drift to test levels below $ 1 , 600 support , traders and analysts said COPPER - With the 14 - day RSI at 76 percent , traders and chartwatchers are expecting copper prices to struggle on any probes towards targeted resistance at $ 2 , 650 on Friday . Despite a move above $ 2 , 600 a tonne on Thursday several traders suggested this level could also offer resistance to the over - extended market . " This market is overbought and if $ 2 , 570 fails to hold falls to $ 2 , 530 could be seen , " Harry Creates of AMT said . But overall prices are looking to move higher against the backdrop of a long string of LME inventory declines which have left stocks at very low levels . Supply problems at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea and the ongoing strike at copper / nickel producer Inco ' s Sudbury , Ontario , mining and refining complex is offering support . " The market is already tight . . . these factors are helping to add fuel to the fire , " one LME floor trader said . At 0750 GMT three months LME copper was quoted at $ 2 , 574 / 77 , against Thursday ' s late close of $ 2 , 577 / 80 . ALUMINIUM - Could ease towards $ 1 , 580 if initial support at $ 1 , 600 is breached . " A disappointing close on the chart signals that prices may move back to test the bottom of the recent trading range , " LME broker Brandeis said . Brandeis pegged support levels at $ 1 , 604 / 05 , $ 1 , 575 and $ 1 , 540 . On the upside Creates of AMT said a close on Friday above $ 1 , 629 was needed to relieve downside pressure and target the May downtrend at $ 1 , 643 . At 0800 GMT three months aluminium was indicated at $ 1 , 607 / 10 a tonne , versus $ 1 , 606 / 08 . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 - 8075

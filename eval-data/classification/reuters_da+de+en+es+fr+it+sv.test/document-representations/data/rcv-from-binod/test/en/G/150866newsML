EU to urge better implementation of the market . The European Commission will on Wednesday back its call for better implementation of the legislation intended to make its single market work by pointing to the results of 40 economic impact studies . A communication based on the results of 40 studies and surveys undertaken for the Commission since 1994 , shows EU member states are not meeting the market ' s potential , EU officials said . Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti , who warned the ministers of the reports in Luxembourg last Friday , told EU members they could not expect to feel the benefits in terms of growth , competitiveness and jobs unless they toughened up transposition of the legislation making the market a reality . The Commission has particularly pointed to gaps in transposition of legislation on public markets and insurance . European businesses , the subject of two of the studies , have expressed widespread satisfaction about the benefits of the market , but themselves are eager to see the final legislation in place . The 40 studies will examine the impact on macro and micro terms of the effectiveness of the market , EU officials said .

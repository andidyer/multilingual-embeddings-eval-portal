The Queensland - based company said the merger would result in a company with a market value of about A $ 2 . 3 billion and allow the two companies to achieve significant cuts to nickel production costs . QNI is currently valued at around A $ 1 . 1 billion . The newly - enlarged QNI would be the world ' s fourth - largest nickel producer with a production capacity in 1999 of 60 , 000 tonnes . The new company is expected to produce about eight percent of the Western world ' s supply of primary nickel in 1997 and about eight percent of the world ' s supply of cobalt . QNI said it would issue 504 . 03 million new shares at a price yet to be determined that Gencor would hold up to 56 percent of the enlarged QNI group . QNI said it planned an A $ 260 million return of capital after the merger . " This transaction lifts the company to a new plane and is one of the more significant developments in the nickel industry on a worldwide basis , " QNI managing director Wyn Davies said . " This is a merger of complementary businesses which will gain from their combination , " Davies said . Davies later told a news conference that Gencor could have made a takeover but decided not to do so . " It ' s bringing us ( QNI ) to a critical mass stage much more quickly , and that ' s important , " he said . Gencor ' s director for nickel , Mike Salamon , said the merger would create growth opportunities . " One of the primary attractions to us in this transaction is the enhanced potential of the merged company to unlock the growth opportunities that each of the Gencor Nickel Division and QNI currently have and position the company for further growth opportunities , " he said . QNI said the merger would establish a company with strong basis for continued growth through a broader spread of assets in the world ' s major zones of nickel resources . The merger also offered significant expansion potential at Gencor ' s Cerro Matoso nickel project in Colombia as well as new mining projects at Bogota , New Caledonia , and the Maggie Hays / Emily Ann mine project in Western Australia . Reflecting its international operations , QNI will become a holding company with operating companies in Australia and Colombia , each having their own boards . Management would be accountable for the performance of those operations to the board of QNI , the company said . Corporate headquarters will be in Brisbane . QNI shares , voluntarily suspended from trading on June 17 , will be reinstated for trading on June 19 . The stock last traded at A $ 2 . 68 on Monday .

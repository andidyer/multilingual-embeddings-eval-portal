Greeks plan major arms upgrading , mostly from U . S . . Greece announced a major military spending programme on Wednesday , saying it would pump almost $ 17 billion into the overhaul of its armed forces by 2007 . Half of the money will be spent by the year 2000 but the programme will not affect Greece ' s European Union convergence targets for economic and monetary union , Prime Minister Costas Simitis told reporters after a meeting of the national defence council ( KYSEA ) . Purchases for the next four years include AWACS planes , 60 new fighter jets , modernising existing F4 Phantom jets , new tanks , transport helicopters , submarines , warships , air defence systems , anti - aircraft systems and trainer aircraft , he said . Greece must boost its defence power to face a perceived threat from neighbouring Turkey . The two NATO members almost went to war over an uninhabited Eastern Aegean islet in January . " Our country faces Turkish provocatons and threats . Our position towards Turkey is clear . We don ' t ask for anything but we won ' t give anything away either , " Simitis said . " This reality forces us to bolster the capability of our armed forces , " he added . Officials said the purchases would come mostly from the United States with some new arms also from France , Germany and probably Switzerland . They said at least 50 of the 60 fighter planes in the order will be F - 16s and the remainder will probably be French - made Mirage 2000s . The purchase was also expected to include three AWACS E - 2C flying radars , about 200 M1 - A2 Abrams tanks , nine Chinook SH47D transport helicopters , two German Type 209 / 1400 submarines and about 20 Swiss - made Oerlikon anti - aircraft systems to protect military airports . The order will also include around 10 Patriot air defence systems which will be placed around Athens , the northern city of Salonika and the southern island of Crete . To boost naval strength , Greek shipyards will build three Fast Attack Crafts ( FAC ' s ) , two corvettes and four gunboats . The type of some 20 trainer aircraft has yet to be decided but the officials said it would probably be U . S . - made T - 37s . Greece will also buy six new transport planes , probably Hercules . " The numbers and types of all weapons are subject to some changes but we expect no drastic changes , " a defence ministry official said . Asked if Greece would resort to foreign borrowing to cover the costs , Simitis said : " Yes , there will be borrowing to raise the funds . " But he said the purchase would not affect Greece economic convergence targets with the European Union . The officials said the government was rallying Greeks abroad to contribute voluntarily to the cost which will further burden Greece ' s weak economy . " The armed forces must understand their modernisation will result from the sacrifices of Greek citizens in an especially difficult period , " Simitis said .

Bombs , marches , hostage siege mark Christmas . Millions of Christians marked the birth of Christ on Wednesday but bomb attacks , a grim hostage siege in Peru and street marches in Belgrade served reminders of the turbulence and dangers still confronting the world . In Lima , more than 100 tired and frightened hostages spent Christmas Day under the guns of Peruvian Marxist guerrilla rebels who had stormed the Japanese ambassador ' s residence . Relatives and well - wishers flocked to the siege site hoping to bring the captives some Christmas cheer while girls in miniskirts belted out carols through loudspeakers to the 105 hostages cramped inside the compound for an eighth day . A woman suicide bomber walked into a church in Frankfurt , Germany , during a Christmas Eve service and detonated hand grenades strapped to her abdomen , killing herself and two others . Police said they assumed she was deranged . Pope John Paul , before offering Christmas greetings in 55 languages to a crowd in St Peter ' s Square in Rome , delivered a reminder that thousands of victims of upheavals in central Africa face hunger and misery this Christmas to " the general indifference of the international community " . Belgrade was a flashpoint as thousands trying to unseat Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic gathered for massive new street demonstrations despite police beatings in confrontations the previous day . Christmas prayers for peace held a special poignancy for civilians in the region of eastern Zaire held by Tutsi rebels , where a counter - offensive by the Zairean army was feared . The Roman Catholic cathedral in Goma , the largest city taken by rebels , was packed with worshippers for a " midnight " mass , which ended three hours early because of security concerns . Pope John Paul dedicated an entire section of his address to the seemingly endless tragedy of central Africa . " Thousands and thousands of people - - our brothers and sisters - - wander , displaced , victims of fear , hunger and disease . They , alas , will not be able to feel the joy of Christmas , " he said . The Pope said the year had brought peace to Bosnia , Guatemala and elsewhere , but was sorely lacking in many other places . The pontiff is known to be concerned over a slowing of the Middle East peace process and pilgrims and revellers were present in their thousands in Bethlehem . and residents of the town where Jesus was born nearly 2 , 000 years ago praised the Palestinian Authority for giving the West Bank town a holiday shine . Before morning bells summoned worshippers to Bethlehem ' s Church of the Nativity , neighbouring Manger Square had been scoured clean of the trash of the tens of thousands of merrymakers who had jammed the courtyard on Christmas Eve . " Last year it was a disaster area , " an employee of a souvenir store said in a reference to the first Christmas under Palestinian self - rule . " This year the Authority organised themselves better . " In India , Mother Teresa , who returned home last week to continue recovering from heart surgery , led a Christmas holy mass at her Calcutta mission . But the bitter emotions left by three years of war in Bosnia intruded in the holiday season . Croatian state media said Serbs assaulted Croat refugees attending a Christmas Eve Catholic mass in the last enclave of Croatia under Serb control , injuring a U . N . worker . Sarajevo has traditionally celebrated New Year ' s eve with the Bosnian version of Santa Claus , " Grandfather Frost " , who delivers gifts to children of all faiths . But after the vicious war that played on religious differences between Moslems , Roman Catholic Croats and Orthodox Christian Serbs , Grandfather Frost ' s role is being questioned . Two journalists were beaten up last week after their independent radio station asked listeners if Grandfather Frost was being unduly " politicised " and accused activists for the Moslem Party of Democratic Action ( SDA ) . The SDA was forced to issue a statement saying it had never tried to bar Grandfather Frost from public celebrations . British bookmakers braced for an expensive end to the year as snow fell in London for the first time since 1979 . The pre - dawn flurries were light but one flake on the London weather centre was all that was needed to force them to pay out . Punters had bet heavily on a white Christmas and one firm stood to lose as much as 100 , 000 pounds if snowfalls were reported across Britain .

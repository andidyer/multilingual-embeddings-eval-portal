CRICKET - GRIQUAS BEAT N . TRANSVAAL BY TEN WICKETS . Griqualand West moved off the bottom of the Supersport Series log as they recorded their first victory of the season with an emphatic ten wicket defeat of fellow strugglers Northern Transvaal on Monday . Northerns were dismissed for 185 having conceded a 178 first innings deficit after Griquas piled up a season ' s best 541 for six declared on Saturday . Griquas knocked off the eight runs they needed to complete their win without loss . Resuming at 11 without loss Northerns were quickly in trouble as Blaise Sommerville was dismissed by Vaughn Walsh with only 20 on the board . Roy Pienaar ( 21 ) and Andre Seymore ( 26 ) took the score beyond 50 but once they were separated four wickets fell in the space of 19 runs . Northerns lurched to 75 for five before a 52 run partnership between Martin van Jaarsveld ( 30 ) and Mike Rindel ( 35 ) threatened to frustrate Griquas . However the pair fell within two runs of each other and Griquas wrapped up the tail . The result leapfrogged Griquas ten points clear of Northerns who now occupy bottom position although they have played one game fewer than their conquerors .

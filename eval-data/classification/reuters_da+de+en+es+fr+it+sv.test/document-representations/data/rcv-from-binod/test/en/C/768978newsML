Pick says mulling fresh bid for Ringa . Hungarian meat processor Pick Szeged Rt said on Thursday it was considering forming a consortium to bid in a second tender for competitor Ringa Husipari Rt . " We will think over what modifications the newly announced tender will require , " Pick CEO Vilmos Bihari told Reuters in an interview . " If we go for the tender we will do it in a consortium with local pig producers . " Hungary ' s state privatisation agency APV Rt announced on Monday a new tender to sell an 85 percent stake in Ringa , based in Gyor , western Hungary , after an earlier tender round ended in failure . Pick , based in Szeged , in south - east Hungary , was reported to have put in the strongest first - round bid for a 51 percent stake , while Ringa ' s Gyor - based pig producers bid for a further 34 percent stake . APV cited " production , cooperational , operational , technological and market interests reasons " for declaring the tender unsuccessful . " APV had been concerned to save the jobs of Ringa ' s pig producers who feared Pick , as majority shareholder , would favour its own pig producers in Szeged , " a source close to Pick told Reuters . Bihari said Pick was now exploring the possibility of involving Ringa ' s pig suppliers in a consortium to bid in the new tender round for the entire 85 percent stake . " It is not very efficient to transport the pigs from Szeged and it is important to involve the pig producers in the business , " he said . " We will involve local farmers who can produce 200 , 000 good quality pigs per year , " Bihari said . Bihari said if a Pick - led consortium did acquire Ringa he would call an extraordinary general meeting of Pick shareholders to approve a capital extension . Pick ' s annual general meeting in April rejected a plan to authorise the board to increase equity capital by up to 20 percent to pay for new acquisitions . The board failed to win approval for the proposal with the necessary two - thirds majority , with just over 50 percent voting in favour . Along with the Ringa shares , APV will also sell debts it is owed by Ringa amounting to 1 . 20 billion forints ( $ 6 . 1 million ) . Last year , Ringa had a pre - tax profit of 183 million forints and an operating profit of 254 million on net turnover of 15 billion last year . - - Budapest newsroom ( 361 ) 327 4040 ( $ = 196 . 1 Hungarian Forints )

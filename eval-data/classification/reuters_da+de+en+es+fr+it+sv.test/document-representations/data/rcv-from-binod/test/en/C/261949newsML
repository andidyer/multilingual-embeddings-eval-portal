Demand high for cargo ex - Madrid but rates hold steady . Cargo space from Madrid is full to capacity on most routes , airlines and general sales agents said , but rates are steady and unlikely to rise in the near future . The peak season for perishable goods coincides with extra demand for manufactured goods for the Christmas period in December and flights are full , airlines said . " Our transatlantic flights are 95 percent saturated , " said an Iberia cargo official . Other airlines reported high demand on routes to the Far and Middle East as well . A GSA with several major airline clients said demand was particularly strong for perishable products to and from Latin America and North America . December is peak season for Spanish fruit and vegetable exports to destinations such as Toronto , Montreal and New York and for fish imports to Spain from for example Chile , New York and Namibia , he said . Fish and shellfish are traditional Christmas fare in Spain and prices soar . Air Europa reported strong demand for space for manufactured goods on its flights from Madrid to the Canary Islands , also inspired by the Christmas period , and a freight forwarder said his Middle East business was particularly buoyant because of extra demand for goods ahead of the holy month of Ramadan . Opinion was mixed about the outlook for prices , but more people expected them to remain unchanged in January than expected them to rise . Ex - Madrid rates , excluding the fuel surcharge many airlines added in November , have barely changed in recent months , although average North Atlantic prices have risen since the summer because the very cheap offers available through some freight forwarders have disappeared . The average rate to Dubai , among airlines surveyed by Reuters , slipped to around 235 pesetas a kilo from 260 , but this is because the range of prices to the Middle East from Madrid is wide . Some airlines are interested in taking cargo to the Middle East and price competitively while others prefer to carry it further into Asia and price to discourage the shorter haul business . Average prices to other destinations were little changed . " I don ' t think prices will rise in January because it ' s low season for general cargo , " said British Airways cargo manager in Madrid Vicente Das . " They are unlikely to change despite strong demand . Airlines shouldn ' t take avantage now because when quantity falls they don ' t want to have to lower rates again , " said Julian Diaz at GSA Market Air . Manufactured goods exports usually decline sharply in mid January or February , he added . " I think the fuel surcharge will be cut towards the end of January but prices as such will stay the same , " said a freight forwarder . " I expect to see a rise in April , " he said . Lufthansa reported a slight rise in European rates during the French truckers strike in November but said this had now reversed . It expects tariffs to hold steady in early 1997 , at least until the strength of demand is clear . - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax + 44 171 542 5017

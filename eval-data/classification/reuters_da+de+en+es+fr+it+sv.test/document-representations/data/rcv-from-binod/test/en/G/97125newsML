Iranian cleric blasts Taleban for defaming Islam . A senior Iranian cleric on Friday accused Afghanistan ' s radical Islamic Taleban movement of defaming Islam by imposing " fossilised " policies . " Through their fossilised policies , they ( Taleban ) stop girls from attending school , stop women from working out of homes and all that in the name of Islam , " Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati told worshippers at Tehran University . " What could be worse than committing violence , narrow - mindedness and limiting women ' s rights ( thereby ) defaming Islam ? " Jannati asked . Jannati , whose sermon was carried live on Tehran radio , is a member of the conservative 12 - member Guardian Council which has veto power over parliament . A week after their black - bearded warriors swept into Kabul in a virtually bloodless takeover , Taleban leaders are gearing up to take Afghanistan into a new era guided by their purist interpretation of Islamic Sharia law . Shi ' ite Iran has supported the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and was hostile to the Sunni fundamentalist Taleban . The Iranian media has accused the Taleban of being manipulated by Pakistan and the United States .

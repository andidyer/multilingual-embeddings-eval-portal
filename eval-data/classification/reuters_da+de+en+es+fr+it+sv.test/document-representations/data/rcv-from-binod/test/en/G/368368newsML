Would - be suicide drops in for coffee , creams man . Max Dadashvili was drinking coffee at an Israeli cafe when a would - be suicide dropped in . Dadashvili , 26 , ended up in hospital with a broken back . The 72 - year - old man who jumped on him from a balcony three storeys above him got up unscathed . " I looked very carefully before I leapt to make sure I wouldn ' t fall on somebody , " the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday quoted the jumper telling police after the weekend incident in the atrium of a swank Tel Aviv shopping and apartment complex . Interviewed from his hospital bed , Dadashvili , photographed in a neck brace , sounded an ironic note . " I have to lie here for six weeks , without moving , " he said . " I am not angry but I don ' t understand why it was my neck he had to jump on . What rotten luck : nothing happens to a person who wants to die but I want to live and I get whacked . " Police told the newspaper they are considering whether to file assault charges against the jumper , who tried to flee the scene , only to be stopped by stunned witnesses .

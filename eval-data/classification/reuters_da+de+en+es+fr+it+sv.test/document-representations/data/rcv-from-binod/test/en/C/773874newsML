July sales data brightens view of French carmakers . Sales figures released on Friday showed France ' s car industry stood its ground at home in July , providing fresh evidence that the sector outlook is improving . Industry analysts are beginning to discern a rebound in the French automotive sector following a 20 percent fall this year in car sales and the painful closure of a Renault assembly plant in Vilvoorde , Belgium . Many analysts who had given up hope that either of the two French car makers would turn in a profit in 1997 are drawing encouragement from a number of trends seen in recent sales reports . PSA Peugeot Citroen said this week that first - half sales had risen 6 . 3 percent to 94 . 64 billion francs , bolstered by a 21 percent surge in vehicle sales in Europe excluding France . A 28 percent increase in sales of light commercial vehicles , led by the new Citroen Berlingo and Peugeot Partner models , made PSA the clear leader in the segment , with an 18 percent share of the market . Group car sales in Europe excluding France rose nine percent , outpacing the industry average . Renault fared even better . " In Europe outside France , sales of Renault passenger cars expanded by 13 percent , or twice as fast as the six percent growth in the overall market , " the company said in its half - year sales report . Renault ' s market share in Britain - - where it is the leading importer - - increased to 7 . 3 percent from 6 . 5 percent , helping it to reap the benefits of sterling ' s 16 . 5 percent appreciation against the franc this year . It is also the leading importer in Germany , where its market share rose to 6 . 2 percent from 5 . 5 percent . Renault ' s strong performance reflects the success of the Megane mid - sized car - - notably the phenomenally popular minivan - styled Scenic version - - which is the top selling car in France and fifth in Europe . " We were the only major European manufacturer to show a sales increase in July , " a Renault spokesman said . Renault car sales rose 4 . 1 percent , compared with a 7 . 6 percent drop for the Peugeot group and an 18 . 5 percent fall for foreign manufacturers . The French manufacturers , which are major exporters to Italy and Spain , will also benefit from state car buying incentives in those markets . Sales in the two countries rose 31 . 3 percent and 10 . 5 percent respectively during the first half of 1997 . " Improving markets , better product drive , fortuitous exchange rate movements and new management influences are some of the ingredients which we think will remove Renault and Peugeot from Europe ' s automotive ' critical list ' , " Salomon Brothers analyst John Lawson wrote in a report in which he raised his estimates for both groups . JP Morgan recently raised its recommendation on Renault to buy . Financial consultancy Jacques Chahine Finance Natexis , Natwest , Credit Lyonnais and Oddo have all raised their earnings estimates for Renault . It said the consensus for Renault is still for a loss of 234 million francs , compared with a 5 . 25 billion loss for 1996 following a 3 . 91 billion francs in restructuring charges . " We ' ve been through the worst with Renault , " said Societe Generale analyst Philippe Barrier . Renault ' s stock hit a year high last week , climbing above the 1994 privatisation price for the first time in 31 months and providing Sweden AB Volvo a good opportunity to unload its 11 . 38 percent stake , a vestige from a failed alliance . Brokerage Cheuvreux de Virieu raised its estimates for the Peugeot group this week , forecasting a profit instead of a loss as previously , and added the stock to its select list . According to Jacques Chahine Finance , the consensus estimate is for a 553 million franc profit , compared with a 734 million profit in 1996 . - - Christine Tierney , Paris Newsroom , + 33 1 4221 5452

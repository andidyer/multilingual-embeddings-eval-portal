Philippines ' Ramos up on feet and back working . Philippine President Ramos , back on his feet a day after critical surgery , held a mini - cabinet meeting and joked with reporters in hospital on Tuesday to try to assure the nation he was back in command of the government . A presidential spokesman said Ramos , 68 , might be released from the Makati Medical Centre as early as Wednesday noon to spend Christmas Day at home with his wife and grandchildren . " Very well , very well , " Ramos said when asked how he felt . " Don ' t worry , carotid is just a small carrot , " he quipped , referring to a cholesterol blockage surgeons removed in a 75 - minute operation on Monday from a carotid vein in his neck , one of the major arteries which supply blood to the brain . Dressed in a yellow T - shirt and hospital pyjamas and waving an unlit cigar , Ramos spoke to reporters in his hospital suite after meeting senior cabinet ministers there . Officials and doctors had said the blockage could have been life - threatening as it could have induced a massive stroke . Hospital sources said a big portion of the blood supplies to the brain had been affected by the blockage , the size of a bean . But on Tuesday , there was little sign Ramos was ill . " Hi , ladies , " he said , waving at nurses as he was wheeled back on a bed from a fourth floor recovery room to his ninth floor suite . A small scar was visible on Ramos ' s neck , which cameramen saw him displaying to cabinet colleagues . Ramos said he wanted to spend Christmas with his grandchildren and hoped he would be " out of here by that time " . " All ' s well that ends well , " he said . Asked for his Christmas wish , he said : " For everyone to be healthy , specially those in this crowd . " The president ' s wife , Amelita , and Vice - President Joseph Estrada were among those present . Ramos greeted his ministers with a handshake and a smile in the corridor outside his suite and walked unaided inside for the meeting . The ministers told him Congress had approved in a special session his pet bill raising the salaries of the country ' s 1 . 3 million civil servants effective on New Year ' s Day . " Good news , " Ramos said . Philippine financial markets rebounded from the news of his recovery . The main stock market index , which closed 1 . 27 percent down on Monday on news of his operation , climbed 0 . 40 percent to close at 3 , 152 . 53 points . The peso strengthened to 26 . 297 against the dollar from Monday ' s close of 26 . 30 . " Investors went back to the market after news that the president was recovering well after his operation , " said Jonas Ferrer , research director at Pryce Securities . Doctors said presidential staff were installing computer links to let the president start his work schedule . " He ' s raring to go back to work , " said Defence Secretary Renato de Villa . " Leave me alone , " were Ramos ' s first words on waking after the operation and seeing people fussing about him , hospital director Raul Fores told reporters . He said doctors had advised Ramos two years ago to go on a low cholesterol diet and reduce his punishing work load . " But he ignored it , " Fores said . " You know him , he does what he wants . He is a macho . Machos always feel they are okay all the time . " A fit , youthful man for his age , Ramos works up to 18 hours a day , plays golf and enjoys dancing .

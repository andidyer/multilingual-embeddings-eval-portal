BZW SAYS OVERHAUL OF MARKETS ARM COMPLETE . BZW , the investment banking arm of Britain ' s Barclays Plc , said on Thursday it had largely completed the overhaul of its markets business and is starting to see the benefits . " As far as markets goes we have made most of the significant strategic calls we wanted to make , in terms of the configuration of the business and the key leaders of those components , " BZW chief executive Bill Harrison told Reuters . Earlier Barclays , reporting its first - half results , said BZW had made an operating profit of 124 million stg . This was a significant improvement on the second half of 1996 but still below the 148 million stg level achieved in the first half of 1996 . Harrison , who took over the reins at BZW last September , said he was not at all disappointed by the numbers , adding if anything BZW was " a bit ahead of our schedule " . " There are no short term fixes in this business . You have got to put in place what you think is a firm foundation for the future , " Harrison said . " What encourages me is that we have lifted our performance and we have a useful pipeline of business going forward . Those to me are the two key tests for us in terms of making this business a really sensible , well organised client - driven business , " he added . Barclays also acted to end speculation that BZW , along with other banks , had sustained significant losses in equity derivatives as a result of mis - judging the market after changes to the tax regime . It said BZW had suffered a 20 million stg loss in its equity derivatives division as a result of uncertainties in the UK market ahead of the May election and anticipated budget changes . The bank also admitted there had been a further smaller loss following the Labour government ' s July budget which would appear in its second half results . Harrison said the 20 million stg loss was " directly related to all of the uncertainty on ACT ( Advance Corporation Tax ) " . " Its very straightforward , it basically means your long - term FTSE index book is just worth less than it was before , " he added . " In the context of what was swirling around the market place , I was pleased that we actually came up front with that . There were some very wild stories flogging around , " Harrison said . Harrison declined to comment on the exact size of the second equity derivatives loss , except to say it was " smaller " than the 20 million stg loss declared . But despite this , Harrison said BZW was moving in the right direction and had gone some way to addressing one of its biggest challenges , which had been to revitalise its markets business . This had been a big weakness of the firm and needed to be improved , with encouraging results . " We ' ve worked really hard to do that and we are beginning to see some really encouraging results . " Harrison said the markets division was gelling well not only internally but also with BZW ' s other arms . This integration was the secret for success , he added , although it was not always easy to achieve . Looking forward , Harrison said there was still upgrading to be done , particularly in IT . But he stressed that while encouraged from what had been achieved so far , " you can never relax " . He said he hoped the firm could now be more settled , but stressed it was a " restless business " and with the amount of choice available in the industry , people would always move around . The people who had been hired by BZW over the last year were acknowledged as being very good , not only as role models but also for their positive impact . Harrison said BZW ' s move to the Canary Wharf development in London ' s Docklands area to the east of the traditional financial heartland of the City had been two - thirds completed and had gone well . He admitted the move and the reshaping of the business had been a challenge , but the facilities created at Canary Wharf constituted " a wholly professional environment " and the shift would help business . - - London newsroom + 44 171 542 7719

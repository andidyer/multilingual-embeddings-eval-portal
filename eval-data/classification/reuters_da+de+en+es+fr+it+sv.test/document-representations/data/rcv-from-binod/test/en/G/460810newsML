Megawati backers attack Indonesia police " inaction " . Supporters of Indonesia ' s ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri renewed a complaint to police on Friday against the group that attacked their party headquarters last July , a party official said . Alex Litaay , secretary - general of the Megawati faction of the split Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) , said he visited Jakarta metropolitan police headquarters on Friday to complain about police inaction over a report he first made in August . " We are embarrassed as a nation that something that was spotlighted by the international media has not been followed up by the Indonesian police , " Litaay told reporters after visiting the head of the Jakarta investigation directorate . Litaay said he gave police a description of damage to the headquarters in central Jakarta , which he said reached about 500 million rupiah ( $ 200 , 000 ) , and a list of witnesses to the attack . None of the more than 200 supporters of Megawati ' s rival , Surjadi , who attacked the building were arrested . But 124 Megawati supporters holed up in the headquarters were arrested , tried and convicted after police raided the building on July 27 . A report by the official National Commission on Human Rights said five people died in the subsequent riots triggered by the raid , and criticised police for meddling in political affairs . Megawati ' s chief lawyer , R . O . Tambunan , said the police had questioned Megawati and her supporters over an alleged illegal meeting at her home in January , but had done nothing to investigate the complaint over attack on the PDI offices . " The police do not have any ethics as they are exaggerating the small problem of the January meeting , but making the major July 27 events a small thing , " he said . Tambunan said the 124 convicted Megawati supporters would next week launch a new law suit against Surjadi and four other leaders of his faction , asking for 100 million rupiah ( $ 41 , 580 ) in damages each for losses suffered by their imprisonment . Surjadi replaced Megawati at a government - backed congress in the North Sumatran city of Medan in June . Megawati maintains she is the legal party leader , although the government has refused to recognise her candidates for the May 29 general election . ( $ 1 = 2 , 405 rupiah )

INTERVIEW - Ugly Duckling looking at First Merchants . Ugly Duckling Corp , a used - car dealer and sub - prime auto loan financer , said Friday it might consider buying financing competitor First Merchants Acceptance Corp , which filed last week for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . " Yes , of course we ' re looking at it , but we have a long way to go before we make that determination , " Ugly Duckling Chief Financial Officer Steven Darak said in a telephone interview . Darak stressed that any evaluation of First Merchants as an acquisition target was " very preliminary . " On Thursday , Ugly Duckling said it agreed to buy $ 103 million in secured debt from First Merchants ' bank lending group . Phoenix , Ariz . - based Ugly Duckling has also agreed to provide up to $ 10 million in debtor - in - possession financing to Deerfield , Ill . - based First Merchants . Working out the debt financing has allowed Ugly Duckling to perform some due diligence review on First Merchants , Darak said . Darak said First Merchants ' loan portfolio could be attractive to Ugly Duckling . But he questioned how valuable First Merchants ' franchise network would be , especially for Ugly Duckling , which has its own network . " The franchise value would be questionable , " Darak said . " I ' m not saying it ' s not there . It ' s something we have to evaluate . " First Merchants officials were not immediately available for comment . First Merchants said in April that it had uncovered financial irregularities " involving unauthorized entries " in its records . The company said in May it expected net earnings for 1996 to be between $ 0 . 50 and $ 0 . 70 a share , compared to the $ 1 . 56 a share originally reported . In April , First Merchants said it had retained Salomon Brothers to identify short - and long - term financing solutions and alternatives for the company to consider in its efforts to enhance shareholder value . But last week First Merchants filed for bankrutpcy protection after saying it was in default under its secured loan agreement . First Merchants has $ 185 . 0 million in total assets and $ 181 . 6 million in total liabilities , according to the bankruptcy filing . ( ( - - Chicago newsdesk , 312 - 408 - 8787 ) )

SOCCER - NAMIBIA CONTINUE GIANT - KILLING SPREE . Namibia continued their unlikely giant - killing spree on a weekend of African Nations Cup qualifiers dominated by a continued crisis of confidence for some of the continent ' s more established footballing powers . Namibia , with just seven years international experience and a tiny population of around 1 . 5 - million , beat Kenya 1 - 0 away in Nairobi on Saturday to give themselves a solid chance of qualifying for the African Nations Cup finals in Burkina Faso next Febuary . Striker Gervatius Uri Khob scored on the breakaway after 35 minutes to see Namibia to their second successive away win , having beaten Liberia 2 - 1 in a World Cup qualifier in Monrovia two weeks ago . The result puts the Namibians , who had the good fortune of seeing Kenyan striker Mike Okoth Origi miss a penalty , on top of qualifying group five , ahead of Cameroon who were held to a 2 - 2 draw at home by Gabon . Cameroon ' s poor performance by mirrored by that of Algeria , Egypt and Ghana , all past winners of the tournament . Cameroon conceded a late equaliser to Aurelin Bekogo after being 2 - 0 up 33 minutes into the game with goals from Turkish - based striker Bernard Tchoutang and midfielder Cyrille Mangan , who plays his club soccer in Greece . Veteran Pierre Aubame scored his second successive Nations Cup penalty to pull one back for Gabon before halftime and Bekogo ' s goal leaves the group wide open with two matches each left to play . Algeria also threw away an early lead away against the Ivory Coast in Bouake , where the Ivorians have been forced to pay because of reconstruction to their stadium in Abidjan . Algeria now need to win both their remaining qualifying matches to go through from group two . Kamel Kaci Said scored for the Algerians but French - based veteran Joel Tiehi and his striking partner Michel Bassole gave the Ivorians the full haul of points and the country ' s fifth successive win this year . Egypt were beaten 1 - 0 by Morocco in Casablanca on Saturday and still have to record a win in group three . Having been eliminated from the World Cup qualifiers two weeks ago , the Egyptians must also now win their remaining two qualifiers to have any chance of playing in Burkina Faso next February . Ghana missed their chance of qualifying for the finals when they were beaten 1 - 0 by Angola in Luanda on Sunday , with Benfica teenager Akwa getting his third successive home goal . Ghana were also eliminated from the World Cup qualifiers two weeks ago and played with a team devoid of almost all of their large contingent of European - based professionals . Ghana and Zambia were the only two teams who could have clinched qualification this weekend but both missed out . Zambia needed to beat Mozambique in Maputo on Sunday but were held to a 2 - 2 draw , with home captain Chiquinho Conde equalising from the penalty spot in the second half . Liberia resurrected their hopes in group six with former World Footballer of the Year George Weah scoring the winner in a 2 - 1 home triumph over the Democratic Republic of Congo ( formerly Zaire ) in Monrovia on Sunday . Weah ' s goal came just 24 hours after a statue of the AC Milan player had been unveiled in the Liberian capital . Togo still lead the group despite a 1 - 0 defeat away in Tanzania on Saturday when Idelphonce Amlima scored after 33 minutes . The next round of qualifiers will be played on the weekend of July 11 - 13 . The top two teams qualify from each of the seven groups for the finals , alongside hosts Burkina Faso and holders South Africa .

Philly Fed report no sign of fast growth - Trebing . The January increase in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia ' s regional manufacturing survey does not indicate a strong pickup in growth , an analyst at the bank said . " What we ' re seeing this month is just a bounceback from that slow December , and I don ' t see anything from the data that suggests rapid growth here in January , " research associate Michael Trebing said in a teleconference . Many firms reported plant closings and production cuts last month , resulting in a December Philadelphia Fed business activity index of - 6 . 2 , Trebing said . Despite the report ' s January rebound to 11 . 3 , manufacturing growth in the Philadelphia area continues to lag that of other U . S . regions , he said . " We ' ve been experiencing larger declines than the U . S . for some years now , " Trebing said . " This ( the index ) is still indicating slower growth than what some other regions are experiencing , " he added . ( ( - - N . A . Treasury Desk , 212 - 859 - 1660 ) )

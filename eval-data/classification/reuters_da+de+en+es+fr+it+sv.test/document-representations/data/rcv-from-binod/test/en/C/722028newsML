Bulgaria ' s MDK smelter has 1 . 9 bln lev 1996 profit . Bulgaria ' s MDK copper smelter , in which Belgium ' s Union Miniere SA plans to take a 56 percent stake , said it posted a 1 . 885 billion lev ( $ 1 . 1 million ) net profit in 1996 to be distributed at its next shareholders ' meeting . " MDK shareholders ( meeting on Thursday ) postponed distributing the company ' s net profit of 1 . 885 billion levs to the next shareholders ' meeting ( which will be held ) once a privatisation deal is completed , " Executive Director Alexsander Alexsandrov told Reuters on Friday . In June the Privatisation Agency signed a preliminary agreement with Union Miniere for the sale of 56 percent of MDK . The deal is expected to be finalised by September . Until the final contract is sealed , the state remains a shareholder in MDK with a 70 percent stake . The remainder is distributed among privatisation funds and individuals who acquired shares through mass voucher privatisation . Some 13 . 5 percent of MDK is owned by Doverie Privatisation Fund . Shareholders decided to raise the capital to 3 . 636 billion levs from the current 3 . 315 billion levs because some of MDK ' s long - term assets in facilities and land had not been written into the company ' s balance sheet so far , Alexsandrov said . The new share issue covering the capital rise will be distributed among the company ' s current shareholders . In June the Privatisation Agency said Union Miniere had offered $ 80 million and an investment programme worth $ 220 million to increase smelting capacity and build a new refinery . A key issue in the MDK sale has been pollution at the smelter site and in the surrounding area . Union Miniere is funding and carrying out an environmental study before finalising the deal . The World Bank said last December it was willing to help finance capacity expansion , upgrading and solving MDK ' s environmental problems once the company is privatised . MDK ' s turnover was $ 111 . 4 million in 1994 and $ 168 million in 1995 . Its annual copper production capacity is up to 50 , 000 tonnes now , officials said . The plant imports some 30 percent of its raw materials . - - Sofia Newsroom + 359 - 2 981 4145 ( $ = 1747 Bulgarian Levs )

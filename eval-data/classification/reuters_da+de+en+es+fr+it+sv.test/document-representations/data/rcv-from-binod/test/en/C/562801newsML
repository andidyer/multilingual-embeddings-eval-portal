Port of Tauranga plans NZ $ 5 mln coldstore . A NZ $ 5 million coldstore development planned for the Port of Tauranga will attract new business opportunities and enhance the port ' s service to existing customers , port executive Jon Mayson said on Wednesday . The New Zealand Press Association reported the on - wharf facility will open in October as a joint venture between the port company and the Christchurch - based Eskimo Group Ltd - - a company prominent in temperature storage and logistics services . With a capacity of 20 , 000 tonnes , the coldstore will be the first on the Tauranga side of the port and would be targeting chilled and frozen products in the fish , meat and agricultural industries . The only other on - wharf cold store is owned by the Dairy Board on the Mount Maunganui side of the port . Mayson said the main attraction of the new coldstore to potential and existing customers was the elimination of additional transport links by providing store to ship access for cargo . " It provides a consolidation and aggregation area right next to the port and gives us a marketing ability for new services or new customers , " he said . The new store would expand opportunity for containerised shipping from Tauranga , but Mayson said he hoped that , in time , the facility would attract new shipping customers . " If you don ' t have the facilities you don ' t attract the vessels . If we are looking to lift our service , we must have the infrastructure in place , " he said . Designed for expansion in four stages as demand required , stage one was a 3 , 500 square metre building with a 4 , 000 - tonne capacity that would be in operation by October 1 . The port would own the building and the Eskimo Group Ltd would be the managers . Marketing would be done by both partners .

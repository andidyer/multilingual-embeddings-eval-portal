McDougal denied bond pending Whitewater appeal . A federal judge on Monday denied a request by James McDougal , President Bill Clinton ' s former Whitewater partner , to remain free while he appeals convictions on fraud and conspiracy charges . Whitewater prosecutors had agreed not to oppose McDougal ' s request but U . S . District Judge George Howard turned it down , saying he was not persuaded the appeal would result in a reversal of the convictions or a new trial . " The motion for bond pending appeal has been denied , " Howard said in his ruling . McDougal must now report to prison to begin serving his three - year sentence on June 16 . The decision came on the same day that attorneys for Susan McDougal , McDougal ' s ex - wife , said they would file a motion seeking her release from a contempt citation for which she has been jailed since September 1996 . Susan McDougal was imprisoned for refusing to testify before the Whitewater grand jury led by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr . Lawyer Michael Kennedy said she will not change her mind and therefore the citation should be lifted . James McDougal was convicted last year on 18 counts of fraud and conspiracy but escaped a heavier sentence because he began cooperating with Starr . He has reportedly corroborated allegations that Clinton pressured an Arkansas banker to extend an illegal $ 300 , 000 loan to Susan McDougal in 1986 when Clinton was Arkansas governor . Prosecutors allege about $ 50 , 000 of the proceeds of that loan were funnelled into the failing Whitewater real estate venture in which the McDougals were partners of Bill and Hillary Clinton . The president flatly denies playing any part in the loan . McDougal also has been questioned by prosecutors investigating whether Hillary Clinton was involved in a fraudulent land transaction on a real estate venture known as Castle Grande . She also denies any wrongdoing . McDougal , who was closer to Clinton than anyone else in the Whitewater saga , said after his sentencing that he had tried to protect the president at his own trial last May but would do so no longer . At Starr ' s request , another federal judge recently gave a Little Rock grand jury an additional six months to examine the web of business deals at the heart of the scandal . Legal experts believe McDougal has weak credibility as a possible prosecution witness because he changed his testimony in return for a reduced sentence , and that Starr would need corroborating evidence to back up any of McDougal ' s claims . Starr ' s attempts to force Susan McDougal to testify against the Clintons have so far resulted only in her going to jail for the last eight months . She has said she knows nothing incriminating about the first family , but fears that unless she lies to the grand jury Starr will indict her for perjury . Her current imprisonment is separate from a two - year sentence still to be served for her conviction last year on four counts of fraud in the trial with her ex - husband last spring . Kennedy said in a motion that Susan McDougal viewed Starr as " the devil incarnate " and she did not want to " do the devil ' s work " by cooperating . " I have not yet testified and there will never come a time when I do testify , " she said in a statement .

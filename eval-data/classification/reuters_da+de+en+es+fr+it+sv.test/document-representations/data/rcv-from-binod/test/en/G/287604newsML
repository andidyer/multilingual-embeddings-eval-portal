Qatar woman says pushed to confess spying - paper . A Qatari woman pardoned by Bahrain after being convicted of spying was quoted on Sunday as saying she had confessed under " psychological " pressure . " I am not a spy and I do not know espionage , but what do you expect from a woman like myself falling in the hands of interrogators , " Kuwaiti newspaper al - Rai al - Aam quoted Salwa Jassim Mohammed Fakhri as saying in an interview in Doha . " They have given me a paper and said sign it and prepared a paper at a television interview and told me to read it , " she said . " Actually I was not subjected to beating , but they practiced psychological pressure against me . " Bahrain ' s Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al - Khalifa in December pardoned Fahad Hamad Abdullah al - Baker and Fakhri . A state security court had earlier sentenced the two Qataris to three years in jail and fined them 1 , 000 dinars ( $ 2 , 652 ) each for spying for Qatar . The case had raised tensions between Bahrain and Qatar , already strained by a territorial dispute over small islands in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar . Fakhri said she was denied medicine for two weeks while she was " screaming from physical and psychological pain , " the newspaper quoted her as saying . " At a certain stage I believed I was actually a spy so signed and said what they wanted ( me to say ) , " she said .

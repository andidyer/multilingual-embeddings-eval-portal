Technicals seen backing bulls in S & P 500 futures . Tuesday ' s romp to record highs likely did not wear out buyers of U . S . Standard & Poor ' s ( S & P ) 500 futures , as analysts still looked for higher prices or a minor correction yet this month rather than a panic pullback . " I don ' t believe the market is going to take the dark path off next to the swamp where all the nasty creatures are , " said Jay Hohmann , head futures trader , Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . " We ' ve had a nice start to the year , but I think the opportunity is still there , " said Greg Nie , senior vice president of technical research at EVEREN Securities . Nearby March S & P 500 futures surged nearly 14 points early Tuesday , scaling the November 26 peak at 772 . 40 and hitting a new high of 778 . 20 , although floor brokers said turnover at the high was scanty . The contract sliced those gains late . Early Wednesday , futures had backed off to a session low before midday of 767 . 80 before recovering to the plus side . Wednesday ' s early pullback did not " appear to be changing key internal indicators that are bullish right now , " said Nie . Although he said some indicators such as 10 - and 30 - day moving averages are overbought , others such as volume and breadth indicators suggest more upside for the Dow 30 index . " The market bulls have done a satisfactory job with this opportunity but have not done a stellar job , " Nie said . " Another approach on yesterday ' s March S & P high ( is ) likely to come quickly , between now and midday tomorrow , " said Marc Chandgie , trading desk manager at Lafayette Commodities . " I think that ' s about it for the next few days , " Chandgie added , noting his momentum indicators suggested March S & Ps then could correct down to roughly 750 to 758 , build a base and then rally toward the 790 level by early February . " That ( corrective ) dip does not look like it will be the one that breaks the camel ' s back , " he noted . Chandgie said S & Ps need to " non - confirm " the November highs by hurdling those levels with momentum traveling upward rather than downward . " I am waiting for a high that occurs with oscillators in the upmode , and that could very well be the top , " he said . " I would not be surprised to see the market come in to some small extent , " Hohmann said . " I would be very surprised if it came in dramatically . " He said cash S & P 500s recently broke out on the upside of a pennant formation , leaving nearby support in the 760 area , with broader support for the uptrend near 720 . " Even in a worst - case scenario , the S & P could lose 40 points or so and still be in a general uptrend , " Hohmann said . He added that if S & Ps correct , 750 is a more likely target before a sideways drift and a bounce back during March to 879 . In nearby S & P 500s , Nie saw a modest short - term upside target at 780 to 790 , with a higher objective at 800 to 810 based on a better - quality rally , within one to two months . " ( But ) if you get under 760 , you ' re going to look at it as a false breakout " that could lead to sideways trade , Nie said .

Strong jobs report hurts stocks , bonds ; dollar rises . Stocks tumbled and interest rates jumped to the highest level in more than three months Friday as a surprisingly strong December employment report fuelled fears of inflation . The dollar also rose , hitting its highest level in nearly 2 - 1 / 2 years against the German mark as investors bet that recent signs of economic strength would fuel demand for U . S . financial assets . Stock and bond investors worried the Federal Reserve would raise short - term rates to keep inflation in check , a prospect that also boosted the dollar . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67 points in early trading , after the government reported that the economy added 262 , 000 jobs in December , far above Wall Street estimates of 192 , 000 . The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5 . 3 percent . But by early afternoon , the Dow had recovered its lost ground and stood at 6 , 640 . 68 , up 15 . 01 points . The world ' s most widely watched stock index gained 76 points to a record 6 , 625 . 67 on Thursday . The jobs data , which followed a series of reports pointing to stronger economic growth in the fourth quarter , worried bond market investors , in particular , about a possible pickup in inflation . " It ' s a very solid report , the job gains are broad - based , and each of the components of the report look healthy and strong , " said Michelle Colley Laughlin , Treasury market strategist at Prudential Securities Inc . " It suggests Gross Domestic Product growth in the fourth quarter in excess of 3 . 0 percent , and it ' s likely to raise concerns that the Fed is going to be tightening , " she added . The economy grew at a more modest 2 . 1 percent rate in the third quarter . The Fed , the nation ' s central bank , has held short - term rates steady since cutting them in a bid to spur economic growth last January . The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond fell more than 1 - 1 / 2 points , boosting its yield to 6 . 89 percent from 6 . 75 percent on Thursday . The yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , was the highest since 6 . 92 percent on Sept . 30 . Inflation is a bond investor ' s worst enemy as it erodes the returns on long - term investments . For all of 1996 , the economy created 2 . 6 million new jobs outside the farm sector , up from 2 . 2 million in 1995 , the Labour Department said in its report . But Wall Street gets worried when too many people are working since that might push up wages and consumer prices . Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents in December after rising 9 cents in November , the department said in the report . " There was a real sharp rise in earnings . . . and it ' s going to make the Federal Reserve nervous , " said Ward McCarthy , managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc . " It ' s just going to resurrect concerns that labour market conditions are too tight . " In currency markets , the dollar rose to 1 . 5865 German marks - - the highest level since August 1994 - - from 1 . 5775 marks late on Thursday . But it edged down to 115 . 97 Japanese yen from 116 . 37 yen late on Thursday . " The fact that ( the ) U . S . economy is growing faster than the rest of the world is going to attract funds , " said Diego Giurleo , vice president of Treasury at Royal Bank of Canada . The inflation worries also boosted the price of gold , a traditional hedge against rising prices . Gold for February delivery added $ 1 . 40 to $ 360 . 20 an ounce at New York ' s Commodity Exchange . February crude oil fell 14 cents to $ 26 . 23 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange . Overseas , Tokyo ' s Nikkei 225 average tumbled 770 . 22 points , or 4 . 3 percent , and London ' s FTSE 100 index lost 30 . 4 points to 4 , 056 . 60 .

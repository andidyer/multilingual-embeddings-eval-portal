ABN AMRO to launch the first " Tier 3 " global bond . ABN AMRO Bank NV ( Chicago Branch ) is expected to launch a unique " Tier 3 " capital global dollar bond this week which if successful , could see a slew of followers in the yet to be explored sector . " Tier 3 " capital is a deeply subordinated instrument , viewed mainly as an institutional product which will be sold to sophisticated accounts , primary market traders said . The bond , which has been worked on for several months , is expected to be a $ 500 million five - year fixed - rate offering which was assigned a preliminary rating of AA3 by Moody ' s Investors Service ( two notches below ABN AMRO Hoare Govett ' s senior rating ) . Standard & Poor ' s Corp is expected to assign the deal with an A rating ( three notches below its senior grade ) or A + rating . The bond is expected to be launched after the S & P rating via joint lead managers ABN AMRO Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley . S & P has said it will normally rate " Tier 3 " instruments three notches below the senior debt rating . The bond is being pre - marketed on in one - on - one meetings and private discussions with investors , with a price - discovery process in Europe and the U . S . . Price talk is 40 to 43 basis points over equivalent U . S . Treasury notes . Heavy demand is expected to come from the U . S . with European and Asian appetite also anticipated . ING Barings raised the first - ever " Tier 3 " FRN on June 24 , a $ 250 million two - year offering , via Goldman Sachs and UBS . The bond was unrated at the time of launch and did not perform well - - the spread widened from an initial all - in level of 16 b . p . over LIBOR to around 28 b . p . over last week . New issues traders said at the time of launch , institutional investors did not know " what it was , how it worked or why they should buy it " . " Tier 3 " capital was introduced in January this year under the EU ' s Capital Adequacy Directive . Those in favour of " Tier 3 " capital say it offers valuable funding advantages for borrowers , enhanced yields for investors and a new area of profitable business for underwriters . In order to qualify as " Tier 3 " debt , securities must be subordinated , unsecured and fully paid up and must have a minimum original maturity of two years . " Tier 3 " capital is subject to a controversial lock - in clause , that stipulates that neither interest nor principal may be paid if such payment means the bank falls below its overall minimum regulatory captial requirement . - - Hayley Pienaar , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7718

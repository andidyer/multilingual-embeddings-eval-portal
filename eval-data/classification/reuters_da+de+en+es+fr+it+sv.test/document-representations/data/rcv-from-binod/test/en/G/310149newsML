Court told Grobbelaar saves cost him money . Goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar lost 125 , 000 pounds ( $ 209 , 100 ) when he inadvertently made two brilliant saves in a game he had pledged to lose for an Asian gambling syndicate , a court was told on Wednesday . Grobbelaar and three other defendants , including goalkeeper Hans Segers and former striker John Fashanu , deny accepting or giving money to fix matches in the first case of its kind in Britain for more than 30 years . Chief prosecutor David Calvert Smith told the jury of a covert recording made of a conversation between Grobbelaar , who won five English league titles with Liverpool , and main prosecution witness Chris Vincent , a former friend . Grobbelaar , his speech littered with expletives , is heard seething about the result of a game between Liverpool and Manchester United in January 1994 . United led 3 - 1 at one stage but the final result was a 3 - 3 draw . " Do you know how much money I lost ? 125 , 000 pounds in cash , " Grobbelaar told Vincent in the recorded conversation . Grobbelaar related how he had dived but tried to miss two shots , thus allowing United to increase their lead . But each time the ball had hit his hand and United had failed to score . " The ball did in fact hit his hand twice . They turned out to look like pretty good saves , " Calvert Smith told the court . Later the court would be shown videos of this " marvellous match " , Calvert Smith said . Grobbelaar , the most successful goalkeeper in English league history , was renowned as a brilliant but eccentric keeper . He now plays for Plymouth in the second division . The prosecutor said Vincent - - a former business associate of Grobbelaar - - would also relate how the goalkeeper flew to London to pick up 40 , 000 pounds in cash after Liverpool lost 3 - 0 to rivals Newcastle in late November 1993 . The money was allegedly handed over by Fashanu , who along with Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim is also accused of making large cash payments to Segers to influence matches . Segers and Fashanu both played for premier league Wimbledon . If the case is proven , they face up to seven years in prison plus unlimited fines . The court heard how Lim had a long conversation with someone in Indonesia just minutes after the Liverpool - Manchester United game ended . The prosecution alleges that Lim and Fashanu were acting for an Asian betting syndicate based in Indonesia . Much of the evidence involves details of constant phone calls between the defendants , and of bank account details . Grobbelaar tried to convince the Sun newspaper , which printed its first story on the allegations in November 1994 , that the 40 , 000 pounds he is alleged to have received for rigging the Newcastle game came from a fund set up after a testimonial game played for his benefit . Calvert Smith said there was no such payment out of the fund in November 1993 , or on any date anywhere near that . Grobbelaar also claimed a payment made into the testimonial fund of 5 , 000 pounds came from a company called QZL . " You ' ll hear evidence that it didn ' t , " Calvert Smith said , adding that this money , according to Vincent , was part of the 40 , 000 pounds Grobbelaar picked up for throwing the Newcastle game . ( $ 1 = . 5979 Pound )

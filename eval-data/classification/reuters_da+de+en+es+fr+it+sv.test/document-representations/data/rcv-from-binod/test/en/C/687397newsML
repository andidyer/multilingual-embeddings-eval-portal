LVMH ups GrandMet stake to 6 . 37 pct . French drinks and luxury goods company LVMH has added 0 . 07 percent to its stake in Grand Metropolitan Plc , bringing its holding to 6 . 37 percent , a spokeswoman for LVMH said on Wednesday . LVMH bought 1 . 5 million Grand Met shares on Tuesday in several blocks , at an average price of 585 pence per share . It has spent around 8 . 5 billion francs buying a stake in Grand Met as part of an effort to block a proposed merger between Grand Met and Guinness , in which it holds 14 . 2 percent . A source close to the deal said LVMH intends to keep buying Grand Met stock until it has at least 10 percent , at which point it could call an extraordinary shareholders meeting . LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault will try to build up a 25 percent block to prevent the merger from going ahead . His goal is to create a powerful drinks group combining all their brands . LVMH shares were up 1 . 82 percent at 1 , 510 francs at 1200 GMT , while the market ' s CAC - 40 index was up 2 . 44 percent .

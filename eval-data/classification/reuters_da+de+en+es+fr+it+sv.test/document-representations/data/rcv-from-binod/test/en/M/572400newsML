Calif . lawmaker boosts coastal bond to $ 647 mln . A California state lawmaker boosted a proposed bond measure to $ 647 million to fund programs protecting the state ' s picturesque coastline , his office said on Friday . The bill ' s author , Assemblyman Fred Keeley , increased the bond measure ' s size to $ 647 million from $ 613 million , his office said . The bill is scheduled to be heard in its amended form in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on May 14 . Assembly Bill 1000 would enact the Clean Coastal Waters and Rivers Bond Act of 1998 to fight pollution of coastal waters and rivers across the state . If the bill is approved by the state legislature , the general obligation bond measure would appear on the state ballot in November 1998 . Supporters of the measure contend that the bond funds are needed to protect the state ' s wildlife as well as the California economy . California ' s coastline stretches some 1 , 100 miles . These coastal areas generate more than $ 17 billion a year in economic activity , according to a report by the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources . For decades , California has funded programs to protect its natural resources , including its coastline , by issuing bonds . Since 1964 , state voters have approved nine bond measures totaling $ 2 . 356 billion for the protection of parks , recreation and wildlife , the Assembly committee said . The last successful bond act to allocate money to the coast was the California Wildlife , Coastal and Park Conservation Act in 1988 , which generated $ 776 million . But nearly all of that money has been spent , and what remains has been earmarked for specific projects , state officials said .

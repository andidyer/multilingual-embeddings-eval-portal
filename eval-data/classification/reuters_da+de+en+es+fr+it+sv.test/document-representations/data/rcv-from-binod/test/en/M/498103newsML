Next target is a chart gap between $ 18 . 40 and $ 18 . 50 . + Gas oil also rests upon robust support and the next target for the May contract sits overhead - the recent chart gap between $ 165 . 50 and $ 166 . 75 . IPE Brent crude oil futures are well supported and traders and technical analysts said they next expected the May contract to aim for a chart gap at $ 18 . 40 / $ 18 . 50 . May Brent closed 17 cents a barrel firmer on Tuesday at $ 17 . 93 and traders expected it to open around 10 cents higher . April gas oil , which expires on Thursday , was 75 cents a tonne firmer at $ 162 . 75 while May gas oil was also 75 cents up and closed at $ 164 . 00 . " In the short term , meaning the next week or so , I expect it to go into a trading range , " said Nicholas Wilson at MeesPierson Derivatives in the Isle of Man . This range , he said , lies between the $ 17 . 65 low formed on Friday , and the low point of the previous significant down move , formed on March 3 at $ 18 . 41 . This number also lies within a chart gap formed between $ 18 . 50 and $ 18 . 40 formed on April 2 and 3 . " It will quite possibly fill that gap , " he said . " But I do expect that after a period of consolidation that it will move to new lows . An IPE broker saw exactly the same targets although he placed another band of resistance at around $ 18 . 10 , roughly the high point of the trading range on Monday and Tuesday . " The picture has not changed much since yesterday - it is looking pretty non - committal , " he saidWilson said he expected " a bit of a bounce " on the May gas oil contract . " It did break through support but did not follow through so it is not looking to go anywhere for the time being . " I would not expect the bounce to go much further than $ 166 . 75 , " he said . This is the top of a chart gap formed on April 2 and 3 . " I am looking for that to be filled and I think it might even make it today . - - Nicholas Shaxson , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8167

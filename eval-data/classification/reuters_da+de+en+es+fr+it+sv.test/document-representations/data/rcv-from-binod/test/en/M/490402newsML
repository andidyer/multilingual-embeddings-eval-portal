US Treasuries close higher amid light data session . The prices of U . S . Treasury securities closed higher on Monday amid light trading volume . With little economic news to digest , market participants generally were sidelined but optimistic that last week ' s selloff was overdone . Bonds fell sharply on Friday after a payrolls report suggested inflationary wage pressures . This week , investors expected to have scant direction to trade upon until Friday when March producer prices and retail sales data were set for release . Volume could remain light before then , traders said . " The next important period for the economy is when we see the release of PPI ( producer prices ) and CPI ( consumer prices ) . The street generally is not expecting much , " said Henry Kaufman of Kaufman & Co . Kaufman said retail sales ( due Friday ) were expected to post strong readings , led by automobiles . " The economy is doing well and for a little while we may have a ( tight ) trading range in bonds . But the lookout for the next three months or so is for really good economic news , " said Kaufman . He predicted yields of 7 . 5 percent or more would be ssen on the Treasury ' s long bond before the year ' s end . Michael McClure , head of government securities trading at Zions First National Bank , said technical factors dominated trade Monday . " It ' s amazing how many times you bounce a point ( in futures ) " the session after negative news sparks a selloff , McClure said . Some demand was seen from foreign accounts Monday afternoon , he added , in additin to retail demand . Steven Wieting , economist at Smith Barney Inc . , said PPI would probably show a third consecutive decline on Friday , despite a large surge in manufacturing activity . Big decreases in commodities and energy prices were expected , he said . Raw crude prices had declined 22 percent since January 1 , Wieting said , but that still was not indicative of an overheating economy . Treasuries were supported by the U . S . dollar ' s strength against the Deutsche mark and Japanese yen . " The main catalyst ( for gains in Treasury prices ) was the dollar ' s surge " which happened despite the lack of comments by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin while at a foreign ministers meeting in Tokyo over the weekend , said Kevin Flanagan , money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . " The dollar bulls are back in charge , " he said . Flanagan said volume was on the light side Monday and probably would remain so until Friday . " It ' s hard to envision going through 7 . 0 percent , we have to wait until Friday , " he said . He said retail sales could post strong readings on Friday , just further confirmation that consumer spending was robust and likely to remain so . Economists polled by Reuters expected , on average , that retail sales would rise 0 . 6 percent and 0 . 4 percent excluding autos . Producer prices were seen as remaining unchanged from February ' s reading . The Treasury ' s 30 - year bond closed up 20 / 32 at 94 - 17 / 32 to yield 7 . 07 percent . At the short end of the maturity curve , three - month bill rates were unchanged 5 . 14 percent as well as six - month rates at 5 . 32 percent . Year bill rates fell three basis points to 5 . 61 percent . Two - year note prices rose 2 / 32 to 99 - 22 / 32 , yielding 6 . 39 percent . Five - year notes rose 6 / 32 to 99 - 20 / 32 , yielding 6 . 71 percent and ten - year notes rose 11 / 32 to 95 - 23 / 32 to yield 6 . 85 percent . ( ( - - N . A .

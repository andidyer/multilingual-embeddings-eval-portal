Marseille had to win the match , played in Belgium , to guarantee their place in the final . The French club ended up 1 - 0 winners thanks to a goal in the second minute by Alen Boksic . " I didn ' t see anything wrong in the players ' behaviour on the pitch during that game , " Ion Craciunescu told Reuters . " If I had noticed anything suspect in that game I would have informed UEFA right away . " Two days ago Brugge secretary - general Jacques Denolf described as " nonsense " any suggestions of any irregularities after UEFA had said they were looking into something they had learned about the Belgian club .

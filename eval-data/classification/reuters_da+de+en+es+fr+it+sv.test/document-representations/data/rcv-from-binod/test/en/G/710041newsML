Kenya police on alert , to stop opposition rallies . Police said they were on full alert across Kenya on Monday as many people stayed away from work because of planned rallies called by opposition - backed reform groups . Police Spokesman Assistant Commissioner Peter Kimanthi said no trouble was reported before the 10 a . m . ( 0700 GMT ) time set by organisers for the start of rallies at some 50 locations across Kenya . " Police are on full alert . . . We aren ' t expecting serious problems . There are a few guys who want to cause trouble and we can deal with them , " Kimanthi said at police headquarters . Asked what action police would take if people gathered on Monday for a demonstration that had not been licensed , as required in Kenya , Kimanthi said : " We will enforce the law . " Kimanthi said Kenyans were " going about their business as normal " but traffic in the capital was very light , comparable to a Sunday rather than the normal start of the working week . Many people said they were staying away from work in case of clashes between riot police and demonstrators in the city . Some businessmen boarded up shops to prevent looters from stealing goods . Some private schools in Nairobi closed on Monday in case of trouble and asked parents to keep children at home . State - run radio late on Sunday broadcast what it said was a statement from the National Convention Eexecutive Committee ( NCEC ) , which groups opposition parties , churches , human rights groups and other bodies , saying Monday ' s rallies were cancelled . But NCEC officials said the statement was bogus . President Daniel arap Moi has warned Kenyans against going to the outlawed rallies at the venues named by organisers . The NCEC last week called the rallies for July 7 , in Kiswahili known as " Saba Saba " which commemorates a Nairobi rally seven years ago when at least 20 people were killed . It said Monday would be the biggest day of political action so far to press for constitutional reforms before presidential and parliamentary elections this year . No date has been set for the polls . The NCEC says its supporters will be peaceful unless they are provoked by police . It argues the rallies are not illegal because they are " educational meetings " that do not require a licence . Moi said on Wednesday the opposition planned chaos on Monday and was inciting youths to take part in riots in Nairobi . The president argues there is no time for reforms before polls . The opposition wants review or repeal of six laws including the Public Order Act , reviled as an instrument of suppression . It is also demanding greater access to state - controlled media . The government has presented the Peaceful Assemblies Act to parliament to replace the Public Order Act , but the opposition says that it is too little , too late and insignificant . Despite the opposition campaign , Moi , 73 , looks certain to extend his 19 - year rule for five more years because of electoral rules and deep personal and ethnic splits within the opposition . The opposition disrupted reading of the budget in parliament on June 19 before a punch - up between politicians . But only a few hundred students challenged a heavy police and paramilitary presence the same day on the semi - deserted streets of Nairobi . One person died and scores of shops were looted in two days of rioting in Nairobi after security forces broke up a reform rally on May 31 which the government had declared illegal .

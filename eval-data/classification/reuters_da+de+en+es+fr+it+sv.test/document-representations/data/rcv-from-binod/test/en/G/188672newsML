Lukashenko says he sacks Belarus election chief . Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday announced he had sacked the head of the Central Electoral Commission , who has openly opposed his moves to significantly boost his powers in a November 24 referendum . " I have been forced to sign a decree firing Viktor Gonchar . Members of the Central Electoral Commission on Elections and Referendums asked me to do this today , " Lukashenko said in an address on state television . Gonchar earlier on Thursday described the referendum , which Lukashenko says will be binding but the constitutional court and parliament have ruled should carry no legal force , as " a piece of legal idiocy " . Lukashenko , who has threatened to disband any state body which refuses to obey the referendum , also criticised the constitutional court , saying it had become " a dangerous organ of power . " Lukashenko said Gonchar had sealed his fate by leading a group of deputies to the Russian State Duma parliament on Wednesday , where the Belarussian leader spoke . Political sources in Minsk said Gonchar as election chief was responsible to the Belarussian parliament , which appointed him , and not to the president .

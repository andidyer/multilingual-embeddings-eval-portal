Italy accepts BNL / INA bid for BancoNapoli . The Treasury said on Saturday it had accepted a joint bid from Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and insurer INA for a 60 percent stake in southern Italy ' s largest bank , Banco di Napoli . The Treasury said the joint offer was worth 61 . 6 billion lire . Recently privatised INA and Treasury - controlled BNL are expected to take control of struggling Banco di Napoli in March once the accord is finalised . The only other bid for Banco di Napoli , from state - owned credit institute Mediocredito Central , was ruled inadmissable because it wanted the sale conditions re - written , Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told a news conference . The Treasury led a two trillion lire capital increase at Banco di Napoli last December after the ailing group announced record losses of 3 . 12 trillion lire for 1995 . Analysts predict it lost a further 1 . 7 trillion lire red in 1996 . The government has set up a bad bank to take on some 12 . 36 trillion lire of Banco di Napoli ' s bad loans but the 1996 losses will have to be covered by BNL and INA . Ciampi launched the Banco di Napoli auction last October and told reporters on Saturday that he was disappointed that there had not been more outside interest in the southern bank . However he said the BNL / INA offer represented more than just a simple salvage operation , but a development plan which would help the entire domestic banking market . " We weren ' t interested in simply saving the bank but in creating something new , " he said . The Treasury said in a statement that it did not rule out a possible fusion of BNL with Banco di Napoli . " The joint INA / BNL bid offers a chance to develop the relationship between the insurance and banking sectors , with the possibility of considerably widening the range of services offered to clients , " it added . INA said last month that if its bid for Banco di Napoli was successful it would take 51 percent of the firm and BNL 49 percent . Ciampi said on Saturday he hoped the Treasury would be able to privatise BNL before the end of the century . - - Rome newsroom + 396 6782501

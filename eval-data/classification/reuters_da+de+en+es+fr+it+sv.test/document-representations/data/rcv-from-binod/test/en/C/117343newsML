Netscape seeks 50 pct of intranets in 5 yrs . Netscape Communications Corp senior vice president of technology Marc Andreessen said the company aims to have at least 50 percent of the estimated $ 10 billion corporate " intranet " market in five years . " I think we can get at least 50 percent of the intranet software market in five years , " Andreesen said in an interview at the Netscape Strategy Day here . Netscape introduced new products aimed at the intranet market and a strategy to embrace Microsoft Corp Office applications and operating systems . Intranets are corporate networks using internet technology and standards . Netscape currently dominates the market for software that browses the Internet ' s World Wide Web with its Navigator software , with an estimated 80 percent share . It also is the dominant player in intranets , but Microsoft and International Business Machines Corp are nipping at its heels . Netscape said that a recent survey by Hambrecht & Quist of 200 companies showed Netscape with a 60 percent share of intranets , Microsoft 30 percent and IBM ' s Lotus 10 percent . " Dominance is hard to measure , " Andreessen said . " We just have to grow the company , build the sales infrastructure and ship the products as fast as possible . " Netscape , which is now 2 . 5 years old , is under full attack by software behemoth Microsoft , which is now giving away its Internet Explorer browser software , to gain market share . Netscape ' s new version of Navigator , 4 . 0 , will now become part of Netscape Communicator , which it introduced Tuesday . Netscape , which used the Internet model of giving software away for free to gain a dominance of the browser market , now charges a licensing fee after a 90 - day trial period . The company , which went public in August 1995 , is expected to grow to about 1 , 700 employees by year - end , up from about 400 at the time of its IPO , Andreessen said . " That ' s a very rapid growth rate , " Andreessen said . " It ' s sort of a sink or swim environment . " When asked what Netscape ' s focus on the corporate market means to its consumer browser business , Andreessen said that he expects both corporations and consumers to use Communicator with Navigator 4 . 0 , which has many new features , including a component called Inbox Direct . Inbox Direct lets users receive messages , data and files from corporate intranets or the Interent on a daily basis , at no extra cost . For example , a consumer or a corporate user can receive selected newspaper stories from Netscape ' s media partners .

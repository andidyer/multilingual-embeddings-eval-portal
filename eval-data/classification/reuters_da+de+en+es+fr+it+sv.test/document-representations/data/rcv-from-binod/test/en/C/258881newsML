Experts see few Boeing - McDonnell antitrust worries . Boeing Co . and McDonnell Douglas Corp . have little duplication in their product lines , easing the way for them to merge with minimal risk of violating U . S . competition laws , experts said Monday . University of Texas Professor Hans Mark , deputy director of NASA for the first half of the 1980s , said that regarding duplication , there is " not very much , in actual fact . " Boeing has traditionally emphasised commercial aircraft , although it has a significant aerospace component , while McDonnell Douglas is exactly the opposite . " I think the merger is a good idea , " said Mark . " I don ' t think the overhang is very large . " Nonetheless , the government will take a close look at any potential problems . For example , the companies are among four competing for a $ 60 million preliminary contract to build a new , inexpensive family of rockets to launch satellites in the next decade . The Air Force winnows the competitors to two on Friday , which will solve the problem if Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are not both finalists . The ultimate single winner , to be chosen in another year - and - a - half , will be granted a $ 1 . 4 billion contract for the project , known as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Programme . The two companies also both build attack helicopters . But McDonnell Douglas builds the Apache , which is a current model , while Boeing will construct the next - generation Comanche . That means the two companies are not in direct competition . The two companies compete in the commercial airplane market , with the Boeing 737 - 300 up against McDonnell Douglas ' MD - 80 / 90 for narrow body planes carrying around 150 people . The MD - 11 competes with the Boeing 777 in the market for airplanes carrying about 300 passengers . Boeing President Phil Condit told reporters Sunday the new combined company would continue selling Douglas planes as long as there was a market for them . Airlines tend to stay with the same model as they build a fleet , analysts said . Nonetheless , the combination would leave Europe ' s Airbus Industrie as the only competitor to Boeing . " Maybe two ( manufacturers ) is enough competition for the airlines , " Don Baker , a former antitrust official now practicing law in Washingon , told CNBC television . Condit and McDonnell Douglas Chief Executive Officer Harry Stonecipher delivered the plan to Deputy Defence Secretary John White and other defence officials at a courtesy meeting that lasted only about 15 minutes , Defence Department officials said . Though the Pentagon must decide whether to approve the most recent merger , one defence official said : " In general I think people in this building believe mergers are inevitable because of budget pressures . " The merger must be approved by the government , both at the Pentagon and either at the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission . The latter two agencies share jurisdiction , although in recent years the FTC has looked at most aerospace mergers . The Department of Defence will convene a panel , possibly as soon as this week , to review the effect on competition for defence contracts and on national secuirty . " We want to make sure that ongoing contracts are completed , " said Glen Flood , a Pentagon spokesman . He said Defence officials will confer informally with the agency making the anti - trust review , before sending a formal letter of findings . By law the government will have 30 days to review competitive implications once the companies file with the government on their intent to merge . That filing will occur within two weeks , Condit said . The government is prohibited from revealing anything about its review or even the fact that the companies have filed . In large , complex cases - - and this is certain to be one - - the 30 days typically turns into several months . Condit said as much , telling reporters Sunday he expected the merger to take six months to complete .

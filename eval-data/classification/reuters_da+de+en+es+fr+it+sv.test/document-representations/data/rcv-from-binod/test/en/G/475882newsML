India crisis may backfire on ageing Congress party . India ' s Congress party made a bold grab for power on Sunday by seeking to topple Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda , but the move could backfire on the fractious party . Several senior Congress politicians were apparently caught by surprise by party president Sitaram Kesri ' s decision to withdraw support to Deve Gowda ' s 10 - month - old coalition and analysts said it might presage a split in the party ' s ranks . " I met the president ( Shankar Dayal Sharma ) today and told him that we are withdrawing support to the United Front government and I also staked our claim to form a government , " Kesri told a hurriedly - called news conference . He gave no clear reason for his bombshell decision , but analysts noted that it followed a string of humiliations for Congress . The party slid to an ignominious defeat in February in state legislature elections in the northern state of Punjab . It was thwarted this month in its bid for power in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh by an alliance between the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and the Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) , a party of lower - caste Hindus . Uttar Pradesh had been directly ruled by the central government for six months after Congress was ejected from power in the state , which sends 85 members to the 545 - seat lower house of parliament . An opinion poll last month said the BJP , the largest single party in parliament with 194 seats , was the only group likely to gain from any mid - term national election . " It appears that the efforts of the United Front government headed by Shri H . D . Deve Gowda are determined to marginalise Congress and to allow the urgent national issues to take back seat , " Kesri wrote to President Sharma . Kesri ' s announcement triggered a host of possibilities , some of which could prove unfavourable to Congress , India ' s oldest political machine , and reactions from at least three Congress leaders suggested it was not united on the move , analysts said . Former defence minister Sharad Pawar , who heads the party ' s parliamentary group in the lower house , said he was not aware of Kesri ' s decision . Former prime minister P . V . Narasimha Rao , Kesri ' s predecessor as Congress president , did not take part in the party ' s decision - making meeting . And Jagannath Mishra , a former Congress chief minister of the populous state of Bihar , said Kesri had no right to take the step without consulting Congress members of parliament . The news sent shock waves through India ' s financial community and provoked a sharp rebuke from businessmen , once key supporters of Congress during its pro - reform 1991 - 96 tenure in power . " The past 10 months have clearly underscored the importance of a political consensus on reform , " said Shekhar Dutta , president of the Confederation of Indian Industries . " Any drift and political uncertainty could set the country back . This must not be allowed to happen and the country must rise above narrow political partisanship . " Deve Gowda ' s 15 - group alliance of free - traders , communists and centrists was formed in June 1996 after inconclusive national elections and controls 178 deputies in the lower house . Congress , which has 140 deputies , was not part of the official ruling alliance and held no cabinet post . Analysts said Kesri was clearly hoping to drive a wedge in the United Front , whose members frequently snipe at each other , often publicly . But the United Front responded with a rare show of unity among its main constituents , including Finance Minister P . Chidambaram ' s Tamil Maanila Congress , a breakaway faction from the main Congress party .

Austria coalition to meet in emergency session . Cracks in Austria ' s feuding government coalition widened on Wednesday in a row over how to privatise the country ' s second biggest bank , exposing deep divisions between the chancellor and his foreign minister . The sale of Creditanstalt - Bankverein has led to a split between the Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and the conservative People ' s Party led by Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel . The deepening conflict prompted both party chiefs to agree to convene an emergency session of coalition leaders on Monday - - the first time the committee will have met since a snap general election in December 1995 . That election was called after the same coalition collapsed after failing to agree cuts in a huge budget deficit to prepare Austria for Europe ' s planned economic and monetary union . Vranitzky , opening a Social Democrat conference in the southern spa town of Bad Tatzmannsdorf , made clear that his party would not be pushed around over the privatisation . He said the choice of a bidder for the bank was the sole decision of Finance Minister Viktor Klima , a Social Democrat . " I stress again , it is Klima ' s decision . . . We are not going to be bullied into a decision , " the chancellor said . A final deadline set by Klima for improved offers for the flagship bank expires on Friday . But the conservatives have cautioned him against making a decision until a special parliamentary session next Tuesday . Vranitzky ' s stand bodes ill for relations with his junior coalition partner . Senior members of both parties have warned that the survival of the one - year - old government could be jeopardised unless a compromise is reached . Klima , in an interview in Thursday ' s edition of current affairs magazine News , said he hoped the conservatives would not force a collapse of the coalition . " That would mean fresh elections and the only one to profit from it would be Haider , " he told News . Far - right leader Joerg Haider , whose party won nearly 28 percent of votes in a European election last October - - just a few thousand votes behind the two main parties - - has declined to back either governing party in the privatisation debacle . Since democracy returned to Austria at the end of World War Two , control of key institutions has largely been shared out between the two parties - - there are even two motoring organisations , one backed by each party . But with the advent of real foreign competition in particular following membership of the European Union two years ago , the system of patronage is beginning to crumble , and with it , the consensus politics that glued the two parties together . The sale of Creditanstalt , Europe ' s longest privatisation as it enters its seventh year , has laid bare a battle by each leading party to protect its own power base . Creditanstalt , one - time bankers to the former imperial Habsburg dynasty , has long been considered the preserve of the People ' s Party . The real trouble in the coalition began when Bank Austria , considered to be effectively controlled by the Social Democrats , made public its bid to take over Creditanstalt just before a first deadline on December 16 . The People ' s Party , who favour a bid by an international consortium led by Italian - controlled insurer EA - Generali , considered the move as a bid by the centre - left to consolidate its hegemony over Austria ' s bloated banking industry .

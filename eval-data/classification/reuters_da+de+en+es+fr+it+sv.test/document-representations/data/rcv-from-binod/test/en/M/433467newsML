Latin debts mostly lower , spreads steady in U . S . . Latin debt prices retreated in line with U . S . Treasuries , but spreads held mostly unchanged on improved volume , traders said . " Prices moved tick by tick with Treasuries , " said a head trader with a U . S . bank ' s Brady desk . The prospect of a U . S . monetary tightening in March has dampened market enthusiasm , but there was also no fundamental reasons to further lighten on the emerging debt holdings , the trader said . Brazil Brady bonds caught more of the down draft , which traders attributed to the $ 2 . 031 billion trade deficit it posted in January and February . In the same period a year ago , the country had a surplus of $ 13 million . For the first week of March , the trade deficit totaled $ 135 million . " This is nothing new , " said Marcelo Fleury , vice president at Garban Corp , referring to the balloning trade deficit . " Every time the government reports the data , it causes renewed concern , " he said . Brazil chalks up huge trade deficit because it uses strong currency to control inflation , which is understood and accepted in the market as a policy choice , Fleury said . As a result , the destabilizing effect of cumulative trade deficit is already discounted in Brazil debt prices , he noted . Fleury agreed with many market watchers that emerging debt prices are likely to be range - bound until the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 25 . Brazil C BR8D14 = RR fell 1 / 2 to bid 78 - 1 / 2 . In the generally cautious mood , Venezuelan debt prices stayed under mild pressure , traders said . Venezuela FLIRBs VZ6C97 = RR was down 3 / 4 to bid 88 - 1 / 4 . While Mexico Bradys were lightly mixed , UMS26 MXUMS = RR was another underperformer , losing 5 / 8 to 107 - 7 / 8 , they said . Activity on Russia and Bulgaria debts was spotty and directionless , traders said . The cabinet reshuffle ordered by Russian president Boris Yeltsin was watched closely by U . S . investors , who , however , opted to stay on the sidelines . " The situation is unstable , " said a fund manager . The appointment of Anatoly Chubai as deputy Prime minisiter offered hopes for ending the government paralysis on key reform measures , but his activism could also thrust the country into new turmoil , he said . Despite its latest inflation figures , Bulgaria debt prices actually trimmed early losses to end just a touch lower on the day , with spreads nearly intact , traders said . Bulgaria reported that its year - on - year consumer inflation rose 1 , 839 percent in February from 476 . 6 percent in Janaury . ( ( - - Nailene Chou Wiest - 212 - 859 - 1674 ) )

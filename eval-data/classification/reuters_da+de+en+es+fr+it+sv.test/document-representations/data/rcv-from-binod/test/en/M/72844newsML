Stocks retreat after Fed decision , dollar slumps . Stock prices soared briefly Tuesday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady , but the market quickly retreated as investors assessed the implications of the central bank ' s move . Bonds also jumped at first before surrendering some of their gains , but the dollar drew sustained selling pressure . Shortly after 3 : 40 p . m . EDT , the Dow Jones industrial average was off 40 . 69 points at 5 , 854 . 06 after initially gaining 35 points on the Fed ' s decision . The decision surprised some Wall Street analysts who had expected the central bank to raise rates for the first time in 1 - 1 / 2 years . Prior to the Fed ' s decision , the Dow index had hovered around unchanged . " I am actually very dissapointed that the Fed didn ' t take a golden opportunity to nudge rates up , " said Graham Tanaka , President of Tanaka Capital Management . " On a pre - emptive basis it would have been a conservative route to take . " In the bond market , the 30 - year Treasury bond was up 12 / 32 after initially rising nearly half a point , and its yield fell to 6 . 99 percent from 7 . 02 percent at Monday ' s close . Analysts said the stock market had already priced in a quarter - point rise in interest rates . Tuesday ' s declines came a day after the Dow set a closing record of 5 , 894 . 74 . The Fed ' s decision , which had been anxiously awaited on Wall Street left the key federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans unchanged at 5 - 1 / 4 percent . The central bank also held the discount rate , which the Fed charges banks , at 5 percent . " The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1 : 40 p . m . ( 1740 GMT ) , " central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said . " There is no further announcement . " The bland statement hid what analysts believed was one of the more contentious meetings of the policy - making committee . Anti - inflation hawks at the Fed , particularly at its regional banks , have made no secret of their desire for higher rates to cool off the economy and head off inflation . Out of 55 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll , 31 had expected the Fed to hike rates on Tuesday . Some analysts said the Fed move was justified by a lack of inflationary pressures . Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management said , " We believe the Fed ' s action to leave rates unchanged is fully justified given the complete absence of inflation and a noted deceleration in economic activity during the quarter to date . " Meanwhile , the dollar plunged , trading at 1 . 5020 German marks , down from 1 . 5125 marks on Monday . The currency fell to 109 . 20 Japanese yen vs . 109 . 89 yen . Currency traders said the Fed ' s decision to hold monetary policy steady might not inflict long - term damage to the dollar because short - term interest rates were likely to head higher before the end of the year . " To me the handwriting is on the wall , " said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist and senior vice president at Norwest Corp . " It ' s a question of when ( a rate hike ) comes , not if it will come . " The upbeat dollar outlook was due to a belief that the central bank remained hawkish on inflation regardless of Tuesday ' s decision on rates , analysts said . " I still believe they prefer to act early on the rate side if they have to and there will be enough of them that they ' ll have a consensus , I would believe , before the year is out , " said Michael Faust , foreign exchange manager at Bailard , Biehl & Kaiser .

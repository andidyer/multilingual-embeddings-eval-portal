Late Tuesday , September West Texas Intermediate / Cushing stood 20 cents higher at $ 20 . 05 - 15 a barrel , with October WTI around $ 20 . 25 - 35 a barrel , putting the roll at - 20 cents . September NYMEX futures go off the trading board after Wednesday ' s session , with the cash pipeline scheduling deadline three working days later on Monday , Aug 25 . Outright crude prices gained on gasoline strength and calls for a decline in weekly gasoline stocks . Estimates expected a draw of up to three million barrels in tonight ' s American Petroleum Institute ( API ) report . Prices were also aided by reports of a blocked shipping channel in Venezuela . The country ' s main oil export route - - reopened to tanker traffic later Tuesday at 1900 GMT - - was blocked by a grounded dredger for the better part of the day . On the grade front , U . S . Gulf trading sources said Light Louisiana Sweet / St . James moved last at an 18 cents premium over the Cushing / WTI , down seven cents from Monday . Heavy Louisiana Sweet / Empire sold as weak as a 27 cents discount to the marker , and was talked between a 24 - 28 cents discount late .

Nervousness over crude throughputs from Canada in September worked to keep WTS firm , traders said . On Friday , the Interprovincial Pipe Line ( IPL ) system said it would slice throughputs 141 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in September , due to maintenance work . Trans Mountain and Express pipelines were expected to see increased nominations as a result , and Chicago refiners were seen buying - up crudes ahead of a possible squeeze . Some traders doubted the IPL cuts would be a major factor , saying the apportionment situation on that system were factored into many refiners ' plans . Regardless , sour prices have gained on the IPL news , and pushed deals for WTS and Eugene Island to stronger numbers . Eugene barrels talked late at minus $ 1 . 38 - 34 , and the last trade was pegged at WTI - $ 1 . 35 . Postings Plus talked at $ 1 . 85 - 87 , and moved around those levels for most of the session .

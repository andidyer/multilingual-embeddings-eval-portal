Kurds warn of Iraqi forces attack over water row . An Iraqi Kurdish group said on Monday it was worried about a possible attack on its territory by Iraqi government forces in a row over the supply of water from Kurdish - controlled northern Iraq . " Recent deployments of Iraqi armour in the area of Kifri , south of Darbandikhan , have further increased concerns of a possible Iraqi aggression , " the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) said in a statement . The PUK rejected accusations made by Baghdad last week that it was cutting the flow from Dokan and Darbandikhan dams in northern Iraq , outside government control since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait . " It is an invented complaint and possibly a pretext for another aggression by ( Iraqi President ) Saddam Hussein against the Kurdish people , " the statement said . Iraqi newspapers urged the government to take decisive action against the Kurdish group . The opposition Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) said in a statement on Monday that heavily armed government forces were massing around the town of Kifri , 160 km ( 100 miles ) northeast of Baghdad . Baghdad has said the cutoff from the dams has caused severe shortages in Diyala ( Ba ' quba ) province , 60 km ( 37 miles ) northeast of Baghdad and the oil - rich Ta ' meem ( Kirkuk ) province , 280 km ( 175 miles ) north of Baghdad . The PUK denied using water as a political weapon against the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein and said water from the dams had been restricted due to low rainfall . Iraq last September helped the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) led by Massoud Barzani oust rival rebels of the PUK from the city of Arbil . The move prompted the United States to fire missiles against Iraqi air defences in the south .

Bombay shares close subdued in lacklustre trade . Bombay stocks remained under pressure for the second successive day on Wednesday , as foreign funds stayed away from the market amid lack of positive news , traders said . " The political situation has affected market sentiment , " said Hemant Kumar Kampani at local broker Jamnadas Morarji & Company . " Few foreign funds have been net sellers in the last few days . " Bombay ' s benchmark share index fell 35 . 58 points , or 0 . 84 percent at 4 , 185 . 64 - - provisional close . Traders said the market was in a technical correction after hitting a 33 - month high of 4 , 448 . 06 last week . The technical correction was set off by a minor party ' s threat to withdraw from India ' s coalition government . The bull run may have reached a plateau and further rise could be difficult over the near - term , Sanjeev Sanyal , economist at Soc - Gen Crosby India , told Reuters Financial Television . " At this point we think that the market is . . . almost fully valued . So , we don ' t think the market in itself will rise too much further , " he said . Fund managers will have to engage in tough stock selection , he said . Foreign inflows were a crucial factor in the 44 percent blistering rally seen in stocks this year . " Clearly , there ' s a problem with the rest of Asia . So , to some extent there ' s a safe - haven factor , " he said . Factors like expectations of economic revival , falling interest rates and abundant liquidity also aided the upswing . Sanyal said the market could show a rise in the longer term . " Looking at it in a one - year perspective we see probably a 20 percent uptrend from these levels , " he said . In the short run political instability concerns would keep the markets from rising too sharply , Sanyal said . Shares of bank major SBI , TISCO and Tata Tea fell victim to a bout of profit - taking , traders said . Large capitalised stocks have been the major outperformers in the stocks rally .

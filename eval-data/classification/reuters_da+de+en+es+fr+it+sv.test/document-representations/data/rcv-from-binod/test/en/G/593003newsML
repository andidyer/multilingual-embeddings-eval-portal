Turkey says 450 rebels killed in fighting in Iraq . Turkish troops have killed 450 Kurdish separatist rebels in a four - day incursion into northern Iraq , the state - run Anatolian news agency said on Saturday . It quoted sources at military headquarters as saying 12 members of the security forces , including state - sponsored village guards , had been killed and 23 wounded in clashes with guerrillas from the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . Journalists were barred from the operations zone by Turkish troops and their Iraqi Kurdish allies , the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) . Communications were also tightly restricted , making independent verification of the scope of the incursion and the number of casualties impossible . The Turkish sweep through Iraq , involving at least 10 , 000 troops and launched before dawn on Wednesday , has outraged the Iraqi government and caused alarm in Western capitals . The European Union called on Turkey to pull its military forces out of Iraq as soon as possible and warned against any loss of civilian life . Its call followed tough talk from Britain and France , and lukewarm backing from close ally Washington . Western aid workers said Turkish tanks and troops had taken up positions north of the Iraqi provincial centre Dohuk . Others poured into nearby mountains , but most PKK rebels appeared to have fled , they said .

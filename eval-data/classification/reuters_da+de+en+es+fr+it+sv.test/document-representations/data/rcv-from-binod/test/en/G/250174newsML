Iraq , U . N . freeze dispute over missile engines . Iraq and the United Nations have agreed to put off until February further talks on a dispute over removing scrapped missile engines , chief U . N . weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus said on Wednesday . " We have agreed to freeze it ( the missile problem ) temporarily until our next meeting in February , " he said . Iraq last month prevented U . N . arms inspectors from moving the engines outside the country for analysis . Ekeus said the Iraqis told him removal of the parts required a political decision and both " agreed to disagree " and defer discussing the issue . " We could not agree as Iraq is not prepared to do it . So we agreed to disagree in the form of freezing the issue for the time being and address it again at our next political - level meeting , " Ekeus said . He said the file on banned long - range missles still remained open . Asked how many more banned missiles the United Nations thought lraq was still hiding , he told reporters : " It is a significant number that is not accounted for . " Ekeus is head of the U . N . Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) disarming Iraq under the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire terms . In the past , he said , his commission suspected that Iraq was concealing six to 16 of its long - range missiles . The destroyed engines belong to about 85 missiles with ranges beyond 150 km ( 90 mile ) maximum Iraq is allowed to possess or manufacture under the ceasefire . Ekeus said two - thirds of the parts were packed in boxes at UNSCOM headquarters in Baghdad ready for shipment abroad and one third remained at a warehouse in the outskirts of Baghdad under close U . N . surveillance . Ekeus said his commission had information about the number of Scud missiles that Iraq acquired from the then Soviet Union before the 1990 - 1991 Gulf crisis but it later discovered that Iraq could produce its own rockets . He said he asked Iraq to take major steps to close its weapons files in all areas - - ballistic , chemical and biological warfare . " We have not accounted for all prohibited items , " he said . " We have not solved any of the issues which were on when we came . What we have done is that we had a good seminar spirit , " Ekeus , a former Swedish diplomat , said . He said both sides had agreed to continue discussions on the missile issue early next year . Removal of the overall curbs on Iraqi oil exports depends on testimony from Ekeus that Iraq has complied with disarmament demands . Ekeus said that at this stage it was impossible to give Iraq the certificate . Iraq said on Tuesday it resumed partial oil exports worth $ 2 billion over six months in line with a U . N . offer designed to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people under crippling U . N . trade sanctions , imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . " It ( the oil deal ) is a great relief for all of us , first for the Iraqi people and obviously for us ( UNSCOM ) , " he said .

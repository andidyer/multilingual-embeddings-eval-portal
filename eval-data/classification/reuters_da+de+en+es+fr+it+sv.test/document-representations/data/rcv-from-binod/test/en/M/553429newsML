Treasuries on Thursday helped to lift Australian debt futures in after - hours trading , stemming Thursday ' s steep local sell - off on a spike in wages growth . The June 10 - year bond futures contract ended SYCOM at 92 . 105 , up from Thursday ' s 92 . 045 close , but still stands well below this week ' s 92 . 200 peak . The U . S . Treasuries continued this week ' s rally amid optimism that a balanced budget accord will be reached and on shortcovering ahead of the key April non - farm payrolls report later on Friday . Also helping the U . S . trend was a lower price paid component in the National Association of Purchasing Management index , which overall was down 54 . 2 in April from 55 . 0 in March and a rise in weekly jobless claims . Meanwhile , the Australian market fell sharply on Thursday after a stronger than expected 1 . 3 percent rise in the first quarter average weekly ordinary time earnings ( AWOTE ) bringing annual wages growth to 4 . 6 percent and above the Reserve Bank ' s 4 . 5 percent comfort zone . The data was seen limiting chances of a local policy easing , and bill futures factored in a tightening before year - end . The long - end is gleening some support from the current buoyancy in the U . S . market , and the 10 - year bond contract has yet to retest this week ' s 91 . 990 low , although the upside looks solidly blocked at 92 . 210 / 92 . 230 resistance , analysts said . The market faces a further test at 11 . 30 a . m . ( 0130 GMT ) with the release of the March and quarter retail trade data . On the month , trade is forecast to be flat after a 0 . 8 percent rise in February , while a 2 . 4 percent rise is expected on the quarter after a 1 . 3 percent fall in the December quarter , according to a Reuters survey of economists . - - Colin Brinsden 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

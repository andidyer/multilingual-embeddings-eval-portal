Mobutu edges towards direct talks to end Zaire war . Ailing and embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko has grudgingly agreed to negotiate an end to Zaire ' s civil war personally , but he appears far from yielding to the key rebel demand that he relinquish power . Mobutu ' s son and spokesman , Nzanga Mobutu , confirmed on Thursday that his 66 - year - old father now was willing to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila , but he cast doubt on any prospect of Zaire ' s ruler of 32 years stepping aside . Nzanga said his father ' s departure from power , the rebels ' uncompromising condition for a halt in their relentless six - month advance , would bring chaos to Zaire . " We cannot leave a vacuum at the top of the country . The consequence would be turmoil , " Nzanga told reporters in the Zairean capital . The U . N . ' s special envoy on the Zairean crisis , Mohammed Sahnoun , said on Thursday that the ultimate goal of a direct meeting between Zaire ' s two main protagonists would be to organise the terms for elections . Speaking in Cape Town , where South African President Nelson Mandela met on Wednesday with Kabila , Sahnoun said both sides had agreed to meet with no preconditions . Mandela , whose government is leading efforts to broker a negotiated settlement to the Zairean conflict has invited the two protagonists to meet in South Africa . Parallel efforts were going on in Brazzaville , the Congo capital just across the river from Kinshasa , Nzanga said . " It ' s the timescale and the place which has to be discussed , " he said . Mobutu watchers say the president would prefer to stay closer to home . Political opponents have suggested that should he venture far afield , his tenuous grip on power risks sliding away altogether . Mobutu had prostate cancer sugery in August . The latest pronouncements by Kabila indicate he is intent on bringing the war to the sprawling Zairean capital should Mobutu continue to refuse demands to step aside . As he left Lubumbashi for the talks with Mandela , Kabila told reporters there was no question of a ceasefire in the war in which his guerrillas have captured half the country . And in a startling allegation , a close associate of the rebel leader said Mobutu had ordered secret police and elite units to kill all expatriates in Kinshasa in a plot to trigger foreign intervention . Kabila ' s finance minister , Mwana Nanga Mawanpanga , told reporters in Lubumbashi the massacre , which could start " at any minute , " was a plot to prevent rebels from overthrowing Mobutu . Mawanpanga said : " The AFDL ( rebel alliance ) has learned from very reliable sources that Mobutu and his team have charged the presidential guard and the secret police to kill all expatriates who live in Kinshasa and in this way to put those killings on our forces . . . to attract intervention by foreign forces in Brazzaville and therefore prevent the victory of our forces . " Asked how the rebels had this information , he said : " This statement was given to me by the President ( Kabila ) himself . He does not joke . We have intelligence sources . " No comment was available from the government in Kinshasa . The United States , France , Belgium and Britain have separately stationed a total of about 1 , 500 troops in Brazzaville , the Congolese capital just across the river from Kinshasa . They have stressed that the forces are there for the sole purpose of evacuating their citizens should Zaire ' s civil war lead to anarchy in the capital . And in a symbolic assertion of its authority over rebel - held territory , the Zaire government said on Thursday a $ 1 billion deal between rebels and a U . S . firm for reactivating mines in Shaba province was invalid and stood revoked . Information Minister Kin - kiey Mulumba said in a statement he read on national television that the agreement with America Mineral Fields Inc contravened international law under which only a legal state could sign such a deal .

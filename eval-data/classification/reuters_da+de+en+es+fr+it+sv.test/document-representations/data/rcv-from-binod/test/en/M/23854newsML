Copper prices rally , ending summer lull . Copper prices surged above $ 2 , 000 a tonne on Friday to close in London at their highest point for two months . Traders said the break out of the range in which industrial metals have languished through August was partly technical but helped by concerns about prompt supply and labour troubles at plants in Chile and Namibia . " It was initially a technical move . . . Above there the shorts had to cover . . . but these other factors played a part as well , " one said . Chile ' s Salvador mine is strikebound , as is Gold Fields Namibia ' s Tsumeb smelter . The last exchange business was at the day ' s high of $ 2 , 039 a tonne , an $ 80 gain from Thursday , and prices were again firmer in subsequent inter - office trading . Other metals were carried higher by copper , with volumes similarly picking up as prices broke out of ranges . The end of the summer slowdown and the approach of the traditionally busy final quarter should see more active physical interest , traders said . Aluminium cleared $ 1 , 500 , and absorbed some late profit - taking to finish at $ 1 , 512 a tonne , up $ 15 . The next target is $ 1 , 540 , traders said . Most other commodities were less active in the run - up to the three - day U . S . Labour Day holiday weekend . Gold prices crumbled after a fresh report appeared about possible gold sales by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , but volumes were thin ahead of the U . S . holiday . Prices have been slipping for the past several days and the fall accelerated after The New York Times said the IMF had sent a new plan to member governments this week on selling some of its $ 40 billion in bullion holdings .

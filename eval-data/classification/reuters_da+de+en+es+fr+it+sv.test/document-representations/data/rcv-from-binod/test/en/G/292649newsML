Burma unrest could affect foreign investment . Recent student protests and bombings in Burma could sideline some foreign investors as they wait to see if they were isolated acts or part of a bigger campaign against military rulers , analysts said on Tuesday . Investors most likely to stay away were smaller - scale businessmen or those who had not yet firmed up plans to put money into Burma , they said . " The little guys will be chased away by this , " said one diplomat . " But the really big companies don ' t care as much because in the big scheme of things if they lose their money it ' s only a drop in the bucket for them . " Analysts said there was continued interest in Burma , especially among investors from South Korea and Japan , although Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has urged foreigners not to invest in Burma until the government improves its human rights record and enters into talks with the democracy movement . Foreign investment has been a focal point of the government ' s efforts to revive the economy , which suffered badly during more than a quarter of a century of socialist rule and isolationist policies of former leader General Ne Win . Total approved foreign investment in Burma from 1988 through November 30 amounted to $ 5 . 27 billion from 226 different projects , according to official government data . Singapore is the largest investor with 53 projects approved totalling $ 1 . 17 billion , followed by Britain and Thailand . Economists estimate only about half of the approved total has actually been invested since the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) opened up the economy in 1988 . Diplomats said one of the big questions was whether student protests in December and the explosion of two bombs at a Buddhist shrine on Christmas Day were part of a plot to topple the SLORC . " If these two incidents are part of a larger masterplan , then they ' re in trouble , and investors could leave , " a diplomat said . " If they are just isolated incidents , it is not so bad . " But potential investors are not likely to be comforted by the sight of five tanks and two armoured cars in the carpark in front of Rangoon ' s City Hall . The tanks are a vivid reminder of the military government ' s vow to suppress any sign of protests against the government . They have been parked downtown since early December when troops and riot police used water cannon and batons to force student demonstrators off the streets . Thousands had taken to the streets in the biggest anti - government demonstrations seen since national protests in 1988 . SLORC accused the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , led by Suu Kyi , of involvement in the protests and politicising them . Suu Kyi denies involvement but said she supports the students ' efforts for justice . Scott Rosenberg of the Brooker Group , a Bangkok consulting firm that advises on investment in Burma , said the human rights situation was more of a factor keeping some Western investors away than the current uncertainty . " People are hesitant to invest in Myanmar ( Burma ) because there hasn ' t been any big movement by the government on the human rights situation , " he said . " The reluctance is not due to the unrest , but the timing is not right . " Last year , several major American and European companies pulled out of Burma following lobbying by human rights activists . The United States has approved a bill for an economic boycott if the situation in Burma deteriorates .

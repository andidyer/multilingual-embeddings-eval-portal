Hungary ' s TVK tests waste incinerator . Hungarian chemicals maker Tiszai Vegyikombinat Rt ( TVK ) started test runs in what officials said was the region ' s most advanced hazardous waste incinerator . They said the incinerator more than meets European Union emission regulations . @ The equipment will be operated by a 49 - 51 percent joint venture , set up with 25 million forints share capital , between TVK and Germany ' s Lobbe Holding . The furnace has a 7 , 000 tonnes per year capacity while TVK has to safely dispose of roughly half that amount of waste , Kepes said . This means that the excess capacity can be used to burn waste from other Hungarian companies , he added . @ However , this can only be done following approvals , based on a two to three weeks test run , Kepes said , but added the company will only accept commision work from next year . " We will definitely not take up outside waste this year , " he said . Varhegyi added that although TVK had to build the incinerator for environmental reasons , they will try to make it commercially viable . Most of TVK ' s hazardous waste is composed of plastics , paints and solvents , but the furnace can also burn waste from the company ' s medical facility , Kepes said . @ Etele Barath , head of the Hungarian parliament ' s environmental committee said the country ' s legislation does not allow hazardous waste to be brought into the country , thus the possibility of foreign commission work is excluded . Hungary ' s privatisation agency APV Rt sold in June a 56 . 47 percent stake of TVK ' s 24 billion forint share capital to foreign institutional investors . A 14 . 37 percent stake was sold to domestic institutional investors and 5 . 91 percent to retail investors in a domestic public offer . On the Budapest Stock Exchange TVK shares closed at 1 , 375 forints on Friday , up 10 . @ - - Denes Albert , Budapest newsroom + 36 1 327 4040

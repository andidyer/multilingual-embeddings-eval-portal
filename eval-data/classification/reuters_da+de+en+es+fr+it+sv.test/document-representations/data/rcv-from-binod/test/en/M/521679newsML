Ecu / drachma eases , FRNs gain , depos , forwards hold . Ecu / drachma came off intraday highs to settle at 307 . 85 / 95 in late dealings , depos and forex forwards were holding early low levels and FRNs posted fresh gains , dealers said . " There was some ecu selling for drachmas above 308 that pushed down , " said a dealer at a private bank . Ecu gained ground against the drachma at the fixing on the back of strong demand for dollars due to a three - year , $ - linked bond expiring on April 22 , dealers said . A forex trader at a foreign bank said a large state bank bought about $ 220 million at the fixing from banks and the central bank . The amount was almost split between the central bank and commercial banks , traders said . " It is uncommon for the central bank not to underwrite the full amount of the $ - linked bond at the fixing or during intraday trade , " said Panos Panayiotopoulos , assistant treasurer at private Alpha Credit Bank . Asked if foreign and local banks differed on their approach to ecu / drachma , a high - level private bank executive told Reuters earlier that foreign banks wanted ecu / drachma higher in order to sell ecus and secure profits . Local banks do not want ecu / drachma to spike because they have lent out huge amounts in forex loans to their clients , he said . Money market dealers said the market was long drachmas and rates were bound to ease further on ample liquidity . Bond dealers said FRNs extended their winning streak on expectations of a reduced supply of FRN by the state this year and demand by foreign investors . " We are witnessing a situation where players are unwilling to sell FRNs because they expect the state to reduce the stock of FRNs issued or auctioned this year , " said a bond dealer at a private bank . It looks as if the finance ministry plans to switch away from FRNs towards fixed coupon bonds , two - year zeros and CPI - indexed bonds , he said . " Cost of funding - sensitive fixed coupon bonds stand to benefit from lower inflation and interbank rates in the future , " the dealer added . The mark was quoted at 157 . 56 / 66 from Friday ' s 157 . 720 fix , the dollar at 270 . 45 / 55 drachmas from 271 . 180 and the ecu at 307 . 80 / 90 from 308 . 000 drachmas .

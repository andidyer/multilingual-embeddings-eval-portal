Taiwan shuts hog markets during mass slaughter . Taiwan on Monday ordered hog trading halted for three days at 19 of the island ' s 22 major hog wholesale centres as troops began slaughtering all pigs at farms infected by highly contagious foot and mouth disease . " We are conducting a massive slaughter in 19 counties and trading must be halted to stop movements of pigs , " an official of the cabinet ' s Council of Agriculture said . Trading would be suspended on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday at wholesale centres in the 19 counties to ensure that meat from infected animals cannot reach the market , the official said . Officials hoped that the temporary trading suspension would ease public fears about contamination and thereby stabilise prices when trading resumes on Thursday . Local pork prices have plunged by as much as 60 percent since the crisis erupted on March 20 . Farm experts backed by germ - suited soldiers late on Friday began the process of slaughtering an estimated 100 , 000 or more hogs at farms stricken with the fatal disease , which is highly contagious and can spread through the air . " The council has ordered the slaughter of all pigs at all infected farms , " the official said . " Even if there is only one confirmed infection , we will have to eliminate all the pigs . " Humans cannot contract the disease but officials were concerned about a possible spread to other livestock , particularly Taiwan ' s large herd of dairy cows . Taiwan television showed graphic footage of masked soldiers in white plastic suits wielding electric prods to stun pigs , then using bulldozers and back - hoes to dump the animals , many still alive , into giant pits . The council banned pork exports on March 20 after confirming the outbreak in the island ' s large hog population , dealing a stunning blow to one of Taiwan ' s major export industries . The council estimated six million of the 14 million hogs raised each year in Taiwan were exported . According to a council survey in 1994 , the hog industry ' s net value stood at T $ 89 billion ( US $ 3 . 24 billion ) , comprising 20 percent of Taiwan ' s farm production value and 60 percent of the livestock value . The island , facing a daunting task in trying to eradicate the disease , was importing two million doses of vaccines to combat the outbreak , the council said . It had only 50 , 000 doses on hand when the outbreak was confirmed .

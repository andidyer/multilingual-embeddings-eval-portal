UN rights envoy slams Croatia over abuse of Serbs . A U . N . human rights envoy criticised Croatian authorities on Tuesday for failing to provide adequate security for minority Serbs who remained in Croatia after their enclave was recaptured last year . " It is evident that the Croatian authorities are still not providing adequate security to the residents of former Sectors North and South , " special envoy Elisabeth Rehn said in a report to the U . N . human rights commision , which was faxed to Reuters . Sectors North and South denote parts of the Serb self - styled Krajina state that defied Croatia ' s independence until Zagreb troops recaptured it in two swift offensives across U . N . truce lines last year . Up to 200 , 000 Serbs fled to Serbia and Bosnia . Only a few , most of them elderly , remained in Krajina to live under Croatian rule . Human rights observers have denounced numerous incidents in which Serb homes have been blown up and residents harassed or killed . Rehn , who toured the area three weeks ago , said she had learnt of recurring incidents , which led her to believe Zagreb had failed to take steps to prevent further harassment . " During my mission I learned of numerous recent cases of looting , arson and harassment in the region , in which most of the victims have been Croatian Serbs " . " The continuing state of insecurity . . . leads me to conclude that there apparently is an unwillingness on the part of the Croatian authorities to take strong preventive measures to ensure the safety of local residents , " she said . Croatia ' s bid for acceptance in the Council of Europe , the antechamber to the European Union , was put on indefinite hold in May , in part due to Zagreb ' s treatment of minority Serbs . Rehn said Croatian authorities were not encouraging the return of the Serbs who fled last August . " Indeed , returns of Croatian Serb refugees have been very low so far , " she said . " I learned of numerous cases of Serbs who have attempted to return to their homes and have been unable to gain possession of them because these properties are now occupied by Croatian refugees , mostly from Bosnia . " While the refugees as a group do not deserve blame for this state of affairs , I believe that the Croatian authorities must act firmly to safeguard property rigts in the ( Krajina ) , " Rehn said . Croatia and rump Yugoslavia , comprising Serbia and Montenegro , signed a mutual recognition accord last week which envisaged a safe return of refugees to their homes .

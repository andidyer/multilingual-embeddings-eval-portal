D . Telekom halves analog cellphone rates . Deutsche Telekom AG plans to launch a new pricing plan next month halving call rates for its ageing analog mobile phone service , its cellular phone unit said on Tuesday . Under its " Fifty - Fifty " plan , the peak rate for analogue calls will fall to 49 pfennigs per minute from the standard rate of 99 pfennigs . Late - night and weekend calls will cost 28 pfennigs per minute , compared to the standard 56 pfennigs per minute rate , T - Mobil said . To get the Fifty - Fifty rates when they begin on February 1 , customers have to pay 89 marks per month under one - year contracts , compared to the standard plan ' s 59 marks per month . For two year contracts , the monthly fee would rise to 79 marks from 49 marks per month . Also beginning next month , customers calling other users of T - Mobil ' s analog C - Netz service pay only 29 pfennigs per minute around the clock , the company said . Telekom said the plan was aimed at business customers who call frequently during the day . " This price cut makes C - Netz even more interesting for companies with mobile service , delivery and sales organisations , " said T - Mobil product manager Klaus Weyers . Telekom C - Netz service has about 550 , 000 customers , down from 800 , 000 two years ago . Although most customers prefer digital services like Telekom ' s D1 network , the analog package still holds advantages for customers with car phones , T - Mobil chief Lothar Hunsel said . C - Netz recently won a contract to provide services for rental cars of Hertz Leasing GmbH , Hunsel said . Hunsel also vowed to regain the lead in Germany ' s mobile phone market from Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH , which edged past T - Mobil in customers last year . Mannesmann has 2 . 3 million customers , and T - Mobil 2 . 2 million . Telekom has added more than 100 , 000 customers since cutting digital mobile phone prices in October , Hunsel said . - - Bonn Newsroom , + 49 - 228 26097150

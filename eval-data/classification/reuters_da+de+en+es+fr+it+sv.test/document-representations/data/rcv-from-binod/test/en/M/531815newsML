Brazil traders say China soymeal buying likely . Brazilian traders said they had heard talk of Chinese interest for South American soymeal and soyoil over the last 10 days but the quantities actually sold may be smaller than rumored on the Chicago market . None of the traders would confirm any purchases , but one soymeal trader said he heard talk China last week bought two loads of 50 , 000 tonnes Brazilian soymeal each for June and July shipment . Another meal trader said two cargoes of 10 , 000 tonnes each were purchased Tuesday , also for June and July shipment , by a physical trader known to sell frequently to China . These quantities were sharply below the 200 , 000 to 500 , 000 tonnes China was rumored to have bought , according to U . S . traders . Brazilian traders noted that the price for soyoil had improved over the last week but said premiums for soymeal remained mostly unchanged . Despite this , there seemed to be some interest in both products . " The premium here has not changed but there is demand or interest in the market , " said David Brew , trader at Brasoja in Rio Grande do Sul . " I think there is something being done because I feel much more interest in June / July , " said another trader . ( ( - - Joelle Diderich , Sao Paulo newsroom + 55 11 248 5417 ) )

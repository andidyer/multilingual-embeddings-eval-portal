Rwanda prepares for major genocide trial . A former Rwandan politician accused of being one of the architects of the 1994 slaughter of an estimated 800 , 000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus goes on trial on Tuesday in the capital Kigali . Froduald Karamira was a vice - president of the extremist MDR - Power party under the government of President Juvenal Habyarimana , whose death in a plane crash in April 1994 sparked the genocide . " He is one of the key politicians who must be held accountable for what has happened if there is to be a chance of calming things down in Rwanda , " said a survivor . Karamira was a leader of the armed Interahamwe militias that led the attacks in Kigali and he allegedly was responsible for inciting genocide through broadcasts on state - run Radio Rwanda and Radio Mille Collines ( RTLM ) . " I see Froduald Karamira as one of the men directly responsible for the massacres in Rwanda , " an African missionary who fled the parish of Kabgayi after the massacres told the human rights group African Rights . " Immediately after the plane crash , every single day , Karamira gave an interview to the RTLM radio making the most inflammatory statements , " the missionary said . Karamira will go to trial on Tuesday at the Court of First Instance at Nyamirambo in the capital Kigali . He is charged with inciting genocide and of committing crimes against humanity , which carries a mandatory death penalty . If found guilty he will have 15 days to appeal . Rwanda has started eight trials so far , of which six have been adjourned or postponed . In Kibungo on January 3 two defendants , Deogratias Bizimana , a former medical assistant at Kibungo hospital , and Egide Gatanazi , a former administrator , were sentenced to death . Executions in Rwanda are carried out by firing squad . Human Rights organisations in Rwanda as well as Amnesty International criticised the judicial process in the country after the two were not given legal representation . United Nations funds will now be given to the Rwandan Justice Ministry to provide legal representation for genocide suspects under an agreement to be formalised this week , said the Deputy Justice Minister Gerard Gahima . " Our ministry has requested such funding , " he said , " but I am not sure whether the two who have been sentenced to death will have legal representation from this fund for their appeals . " " Under our law it is permissible for people to be tried without lawyers . If people think you can sweep the genocide of one million people under the carpet because there are no lawyers , they can think again , " he said . International organisations , as well as the two non - governmental legal groups , Avocats Sans Frontieres ( ASF ) and Juristes Sans Frontieres , provided legal representation at two trials held in Kigali on 30 December . The genocide trials have been slow to start because Rwanda ' s justice system collapsed when the former Hutu government was ousted in 1994 . " At least they have got things moving , however shakily , " said one western diplomat .

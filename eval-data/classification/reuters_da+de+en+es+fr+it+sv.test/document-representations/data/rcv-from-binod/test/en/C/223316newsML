Solidere says GDR issue successful . An international share issue by Solidere , Lebanon ' s biggest company , fell short of its target but Beirut bankers said on Thursday the $ 77 million issue was a significant achievement . Solidere said the issue of Global Depositary Receipts ( GDRs ) was oversubscribed but the company scaled back allocations , restricting them to medium - and long - term investors . " Subscription orders reached a total of $ 140 million from international investment funds and institutions , " the company said in a statement . " A total sum of $ 77 million only of the total subscription orders was allocated to funds that follow a medium or long term investment policy , " it added . According to market sources , Solidere had planned to issue 10 million GDRs worth $ 115 - 125 million , giving non - Arabs their first chance to invest in the company ' s reconstruction of Beirut ' s city centre . Instead , it sold 6 . 7 million GDRs at $ 11 . 50 , each representing one - tenth of a Solidere A share . It was Solidere ' s first venture on the international market since its heavily oversubscribed $ 650 million share flotation in January 1994 which was limited to Lebanese and Arab investors . The issue was the first major deal out of Lebanon not targeted at Lebanese money abroad . Market sources said demand from the United States and Europe was " very strong . " The GDRs were quoted on Thursday in London on SEAQ , the Stock Exchange Automated Quotations system , at $ 11 . 50 - $ 11 . 70 but the underlying A shares fell in Beirut to $ 111 . 875 and $ 113 . 625 at the Beirut Stock Exchange ' s two fixings from $ 113 and $ 114 . 25 on Wednesday . Michel Aramouni of Banque Audi ' s Treasury and Capital Markets said Solidere achieved its target of issuing a large slice of GDRs to international investors not eligible under Lebanese law to buy the underlying shares . " In that sense it is a success but we can ' t talk about it as a hot issue , " Aramouni said . A Beirut trader who asked not to be identified called the shortfall " a bit of a blow " but said that selling GDRs worth $ 77 million was a success in itself for Solidere . But another trader said : " The issue came in at the low end of the pricing and volume . Investors bought for $ 77 million and that ' s a significant amount , but it didn ' t go as well as expected . " He said he was not convinced that Solidere did not allocate 100 percent of the demand in order to exclude hot investors who would take very quick profits . " I don ' t buy that too much , frankly , " he said . Market sources said although the deal was heavily oversubscribed it was not sufficient to justify an issue of the size originally intended . " They wanted a position where there was after - market demand . . . In order to have sufficient after - market demand they didn ' t want people to get all the allocation they asked for . That ' s why they scaled back the issue , " one source said . " The vast majority of the demand came from U . S . and European investors . This was a deal targetted at international investors and there was very strong demand among them , " he added .

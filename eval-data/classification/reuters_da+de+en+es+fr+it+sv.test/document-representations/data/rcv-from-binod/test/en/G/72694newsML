Daredevil Canadian braves the Shanghai skyline . As thousands held their breath 120 metres below , Canadian Jay Cochrane eased his way along a tightrope connecting two skyscrapers in Shanghai on Tuesday night . Carrying a balancing pole and without any apparent safety harness , Cochrane began the floodlit - stunt tentatively . But with pop music blaring , and applause from the several thousand paying specatators , the daredevil Canadian was quickly in his stride and took just 15 minutes to cover the 200 metres . The event , in the city ' s Pudong New Area , was part of the Shanghai Tourism Festival 1996 , and was broadcast live on a Shanghai television channel . Onlookers had paid 220 yuan ( $ 27 ) each for tickets . Last year Cochrane walked 628 metres over a wire strung 375 metres above the Yangtze River in southwest China .

U . S . to name $ 1 . 1 bln airborne laser pact winner . The Air Force said on Tuesday it would announce at 1630 EST / 2130 GMT the winner of a competition for a $ 1 . 1 billion contract for early development of an airborne laser to destroy ballistic missiles in flight . Two competing contractor teams , one headed by Boeing Co and the other by Rockwell International Corp , are seeking to develop the prototype laser and mount it on a modified Boeing 747 jet . The Boeing team includes Lockheed Martin Corp and TRW Inc . The Rockwell team includes General Motors Corp ' s Hughes aircraft division and the E - Systems unit of Raytheon Corp . The development work will initially be worth $ 1 . 1 billion in contracts over the next six years to the winning team . But it could mean tens of billions of dollars in work down the road if the effort to direct destructive laser beams from an airborne platform at tactical missiles in flight is successful . If such a laser can burn up short - and mid - range missiles in flight , then the Air Force hopes to build three operational aircraft platforms by the year 2006 and a total of seven such aircraft by 2008 . The initial test system is expected to make an attempt around the year 2002 to shoot down a theater ballistic missile at a range of more than 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) .

Hawker says Austrim bid " a bit low " . Car components manufacturer group Hawker Richardson Ltd on Monday described the A $ 1 . 60 a share on - market takeover bid by Alan Jackson ' s investment group Austrim Ltd as a bit low . " From my impressions , it ' s possibly a bit low , " Hawker Richardson Dale Hudson told Reuters . " From speaking to a few brokers , they believe that ' s the case too , " Hudson said , adding that it was only five cents above the A $ 1 . 55 12 - month high reached in February . Hawker Richardson had not made a formal response to the bid , but was likely to later on Monday , he said . Austrim Managing Director Alan Jackson , former chief executive of BTR Plc , later said the bid was fully priced and Austrim was not considering increasing it . " I guess the punters are there at the moment hoping something else might happen , but we ' ve decided not to fiddle and we ' ve come with a full price , right up front , " Jackson told Reuters in an interview . " There ' d be no consideration of that at this time , " he said when asked if the price would be raised . Jackson said the price was at a 20 to 30 percent premium to the A $ 1 . 30 to A $ 1 . 35 range in which Hawker ' s share price had travelled this year . Austrim announced a A $ 42 million share placement to partly pay for the acquisition . This latest takeover follows the A $ 41 million acquisition of a vehicle hire and workshop business from the South Australian Commissioner of Highways in March and the A $ 53 million purchase of Calum textiles in February . Hawker ' s shares were up 30 cents at A $ 1 . 65 at 3 . 35 p . m . ( 0535 GMT ) . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

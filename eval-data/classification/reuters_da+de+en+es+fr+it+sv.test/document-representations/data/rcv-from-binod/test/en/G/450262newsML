Hundreds swarm New York motorcade for slain rapper . Hundreds of fans mobbed a motorcade carrying the body of rap superstar Notorious B . I . G . on Tuesday , causing pandemonium in the impoverished New York City neighbourhood where the slain musician once lived . The motorcade followed funeral services in Manhattan for the 24 - year - old rapper , also known as Biggie Smalls , whose real name was Christopher Wallace . He was killed in a drive - by shooting outside a Los Angeles party on March 9 . The procession bearing his body was led by four flower - filled cars , one with the letters B . I . G . spelled out in red carnations , through the Fort Greene and Bedford - Stuyvesant neighbourhoods of Brooklyn , where Wallace grew up and was a drug dealer before finding success in the music industry . More than a dozen limousines followed the hearse . Hundreds of fans yelled , screamed , applauded and cheered as the motorcade passed . Many chanted " B - I - G , B - I - G forever " and vendors hawked t - shirts with the rapper ' s likeness . Police in riot gear and helmets tried to keep order and some sprayed mace at members of the crowd . A half - dozen people were arrested , including a reporter , and traffic was stopped for blocks . Some people were taken from the scene in ambulances but authorities did not immediately have numbers or other details . Shopkeepers along the procession route pulled down their metal shutters for protection against the unruly crowd . Wallace ' s funeral in Manhattan was closed to the public but those inside said several people including producer Sean " Puffy " Combs deliver remembrances . Combs runs Wallace ' s record label , Bad Boy Entertainment , and was with him the night he was killed . Also among the music industry celebrities at the funeral were a visibly emotional Queen Latifah ; rappers Havoc of Mobb Deep , Nas and Busta Rhymes ; and Run of Run - DMC , a pioneering rap trio , who calls himself Rev . Run and preaches at a local church . Former Mayor David Dinkins , New York ' s first black mayor , also attended at the request of the family . Los Angeles detectives investigating the murder flew to New York to interview witnesses to the killing , a spokeswoman said . The killing remains unsolved . Wallace ' s bitter rival , Tupac Shakur , was killed in a similar ambush last year in Las Vegas . That slaying also is unsolved . The two feuded in what was touted as a rivalry between West and East Coast rap , with Shakur ' s Los Angeles - based Death Row Records label run by Marion " Suge " Knight pitted against Wallace ' s and Combs ' New York - based Bad Boy Entertainment . The Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman declined to comment on a Los Angeles Times report that Wallace was gunned down by a local gang member in a personal dispute over money . The newspaper cited law enforcement sources as saying they had found no evidence the shooting was linked to an East Coast - West Coast feud in the rap community or any Los Angeles street gang rivalries . Neither was there any evidence the killing of Notorious B . I . G . was in any way connected to the September murder of Shakur , another source told the Times .

America Online to start charging vendors " rent " . America Online Inc . will start charging retailers " rent " for their locations on the nation ' s largest online service instead of a cut of sales , AOL said Monday . " We have the most valuable real estate in cyberspace , " AOL spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg said . " We want to encourage our marchandise partners to value their online real estate with the same seriousness as if they were in a real mall . " Starting next month , retailers that used to pay a commission for the right to peddle their wares on AOL ' s Market Place service will be charged a flat flee instead , she said . In addition to helping AOL ' s finances , the changes should help attract more dedicated vendors and provide better service for shoppers , industry analysts said . " I think it ' s a good idea for them . AOL is starting to realize the value of its own real estate , " said Patrick Keane , an analyst with research firm Jupiter Communications . Keane said the change did not mean the commission system was unsuccessful . Rather , he said , " it points to the fact that AOL has to do anything it can to diversify revenues . " Keane predicted the company would achieve more balanced revenues under the new plan , but that smaller retailers , unable to pay the flat fees , might fall away . Until now , Goldberg said , most of the company ' s electronic retailers paid commissions of about 10 percent to 20 percent of sales in exchange for an online storefront on AOL ' s Market Place service . But the system did not provide strong incentives for retailers to generate sales , and the merchants sometimes viewed their electronic storefronts as experiments . When AOL replaces Market Place with its new Shopping Channel in late August , on the other hand , retailers appearing there will be paying a flat fee , starting at $ 125 , 000 for a year ' s lease in cyberspace . Companies deciding to pay " rent " on the Shopping Channel will have a larger stake in their online business and will be more likely to put their best foot forward in terms of advertising and presentation , Goldberg said . AOL has already signed agreements with book seller Barnes & Noble Inc . and floral delivery service 1 - 800 Flowers to take space in its new online mall .

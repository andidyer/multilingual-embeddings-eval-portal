News Corp seen hitting " Speed " bump on profits . Rupert Murdoch ' s News Corp Ltd is expected to report on Wednesday that movie flops " Speed II " and " Volcano " held back the global media group from achieving Murdoch ' s own 20 - percent profit growth forecast for 1996 / 97 . Analysts said the two film duds have generated losses of US $ 75 million to US $ 100 million in the fourth quarter , reining in growth in New Corp ' s annual net profit before abnormal items to about 12 percent for the year to June 30 . Murdoch said a year ago , after News posted a A $ 1 . 263 billion ( US $ 937 million ) pre - abnormal net profit for 1995 / 96 , that the hit movie " Independence Day " , moderating paper prices and strong U . S . television revenues would push profits up 20 percent in 1996 / 97 . Murdoch repeated this forecast at the annual meeting in October and as recently as May after the third quarter results . But analysts said that many had cut their forecasts in the last month by about A $ 50 million to A $ 100 million to around A $ 1 . 42 billion because of poor performance from the film division and a lacklustre fourth quarter from the company ' s Fox television network in the United States . " The biggest negative for the fourth quarter will be the film division and there ' ll be a very large write - off for Volcano and Speed , " said one Melbourne media analyst . " I guess people will be disappointed because it ' s not up 20 percent as we were told it would be , " the analyst said . Analysts said lower paper prices and a strong rise in British newspaper revenues because of firm circulations and advertising volumes would boost overall profit for the year , but U . S . film and network TV would take the cream off the top . Australian operations remained moribund because of a slow economy and an expensive venture to create a new rugby league competition - - Super League . News would receive a nominal boost from the individual television stations in the U . S . New World group bought during the year but analysts noted the acquisitions had come at the cost of dilution . Earnings per share ( EPS ) in 1997 / 98 would suffer as a result . Many said they would focus on the performance at New World , where information had been scarce until now . " The interest will be in how much they have improved the margins at the New World stations , " one analyst said . Analysts said many shareholders remained unhappy with News Corp ' s appetite for acquisitions funded through share issues and wanted News to concentrate on immediate earnings per share improvement rather than long term growth . " If they care to concentrate a bit more on short - term earnings enhancement and less on long strategic position , then their stockholders will be a happier and wealthier bunch , " said another Sydney analyst . " They should just stop pushing for the territory and just allow some of the earnings improvements that they are achieving in newspapers to be more visible at an EPS level . " Analysts said they would be looking for abnormal losses of as much as A $ 400 million , due largely from already announced charges of US $ 270 million from News Corp ' s HarperCollins book publishing division . This would leave net profit after abnormals struggling to get over the A $ 1 billion mark for the year . ( AS1 = US $ 0 . 74 )

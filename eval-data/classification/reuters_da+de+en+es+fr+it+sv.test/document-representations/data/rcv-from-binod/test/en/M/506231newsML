The peso moved in a narrow band from 26 . 359 / 26 . 362 in light trade as dollar inflows were held back by a belief the Central Bank could raise on Tuesday its overnight borrowing rate which at present is at 10 percent , dealers said . This would be in line with the increase in Treasury bill rates at the regular auction on Monday . " It ' s better to sell dollars now . If the Central Bank raises rates , arbitrage money will come in . It ' s better to buy the dollar when it ' s lower , " a dealer said .

Volume was light at $ 119 . 5 million from $ 148 . 9 million . - - LILIAN KARUNUNGAN ( 632 ) 841 - 8937

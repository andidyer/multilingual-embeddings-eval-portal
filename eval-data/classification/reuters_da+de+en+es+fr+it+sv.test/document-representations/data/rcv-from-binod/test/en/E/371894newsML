OPINION - S . African debt management - By E . Osborn . By Edward Osborn , consultant to Edey , Rogers ( Pty ) LtdCabinet ' s decisions last week with regard to the state ' s debt , cash and asset management were of signal importance but , nevertheless , pose a few queries . The objectives seem patently sensible in theory but , in a number of respects , they oversimplify matters . According to the press release of the Ministry of Finance , the funding activities currently being performed by the Reserve Bank on behalf of government will be separated or , to use the Ministry ' s word , ringfenced , from the monetary policy activities of the Bank . But , furthermore , the Bank is to carry on negotiating the shift of the risk of market - making to the private sector . As a pre - requisite it will be necessary to transform the present tap system to a tender or auction system . The Departments of Finance and State Expenditure are to develop systems and structures for effective cash management with a focus on management of liquidity that ensures that funds are available at the right times and in the right places . The daily administration and management of the flows to and from the Tax and Loan Accounts ( T & L ) held with the private sector banks will be transferred from the Reserve Bank to the Department of Finance . It is envisaged that substantial savings will derive from better management systems and improved transmission techniques . On asset management the Ministry of Finance will be empowered to interact directly with general government bodies and public enterprise , rather than mediate through the responsible departments , in order to implement a risk management strategy in support of the growth , employment and redistribution policy and the restructuring of state assets . The last is vital in that it gives the Ministry of Finance a direct involvement in the whole privatisation process and command over the disposal of the proceeds in terms of reinvestment , absorption into revenue or the funding of debt retirement . However , there are problems with the decisions on debt management and cash management which flow from the desire to separate the state functions of funding its activities and the exercise of monetary policy . The sloughing off of the Bank ' s market - making risks is a different issue . The essence of the problem is that the monetary activities of the Bank as carried out through so - called open market operations impinge on the exchequer accounts of government , and , vice versa , the flows of funds into and out of the exchequer accounts have an effect on monetary conditions . The two interact and it is unrealistic to build glass or Chinese walls between them . When the money market is excessively liquid , say for balance of payments reasons , the Bank could in normal circumstances mop up liquidity through the sale of government stock into the market . The proceeds of the sales will go into the Exchequer Account and be indistinguishable from funding sales of the Bank on behalf of government . However , if the policy is to proceed with the abolition of the present tap system the Bank will be denied government stock from the tap in order to carry out its open market operations of selling stock . Its power will be partially circumscribed . However , the Bank does have in store as much as 7 . 7 billion rand of the Z016 zero interest stock issued to it by Treasury in redemption of accumulated forex losses incurred in supporting the forward exchange market . And there must be more to come following the disruptions to the rand during 1996 and Governor Stals disclosing a 20 billion rand oversold position on the forward cover book . The Bank has tended to use this stock in recent years for open - market operations , as in September to November 1995 to the tune of 2 , 9 billion rand , when there was a surfeit of liquidity . Presumably , it will be permitted to continue doing so and the circumstances of 1995 may be repeated soon shold there be further sizeable inflows of foreign portfolio capital . But the arrangement with this stock is that on sale to the private sector it is transformed into interest - bearing stock . Automatically in the public debt statement the state ' s liability in respect of the Z016 stock is reduced and the liability in respect of the , possibly , R153 2009 / 10 / 11 is increased by an even greater amount depending on the extent of the current discount in the market . The R153 carries a coupon of 13 percent and therefore the open - market operation impinges on the interest bill in the budget . There is no imputed interest and redemption in the interest bill for the Z016 stock , unlike the other zero - interest stocks . The T & L accounts were originally mooted in the De Kock Commission report as a means of stabilising the money market as considerable flows from and to the private sector are held within the private banking system . These days the credits and debits with these accounts average some 30 billion rand a month . Indeed the major part of government balances tend to be kept in these accounts these days . But these accounts were also seen as a means of influencing the money market conditions as any transfer of balances from them to the Exchequer Account held with the Reserve Bank would increase the money market shortage , and vice versa . The T & L accounts could be a further instrument of monetary policy . The suggestion in the press release of transferring the administration of these accounts to the Ministry implies that the Reserve Bank is to be denied this possible use of the accounts for monetary purposes . But , on the other hand , should the Ministry of Finance for any reason of its own either channel funds from the T & L accounts to the Exchequer Account with the Bank or direct flows into the Exchequer Account preference , or vice versa , such actions will impinge on the state of the money market . In short the decisions of Cabinet in one fell swoop limit the powers of the Reserve Bank in carrying out its open - market operations , but also overlook the reality if continuing interaction between monetary activities and fiscal activities . Clearly the squaring of the circle is only possible through the contiuation of the closest working liaison between the Bank and the Ministry of Finance . It is naive to believe that there can be complete independence of the two . / / / / / / / ( The opinions expressed in this article represent those of the author only .

Tajiks delay accord signing for technical reasons . Opponents in Tajikistan ' s protracted civil war have delayed the signing of a peace accord until later this month , an official in the former Soviet republic said on Tuesday . " The meeting of ( Tajik ) President Imomali Rakhmonov and the leader of the United Tajik Opposition ( Sayid Abdullo Nuri ) in Moscow planned for June 14 has been postponed until later in June , " Rakhmonov ' s spokesman Zafar Saidov said . He told reporters that the delay had been caused by " technical reasons " but gave no further details . The agreement is due to set the seal on peace talks aimed at ending a four - year civil war . The talks started last December when Rakhmonov ' s secular government and Nuri ' s Islamist opposition guerrillas agreed a ceasefire . The conflict killed tens of thousands and displaced many more . The ceasefire , brokered by the United Nations , Russia and Iran , has largely held . The two sides have hammered out a power sharing deal but the issue of legalising opposition parties and press remains the main outstanding issue .

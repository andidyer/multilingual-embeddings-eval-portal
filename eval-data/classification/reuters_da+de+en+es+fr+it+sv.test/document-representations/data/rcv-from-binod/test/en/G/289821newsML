Hong Kong warned against trying to change China . Lord Howe , Britain ' s foreign minister at the time of the drafting of a treaty on the handover of Hong Kong to China , warned the British colony on Monday against trying to trigger political change on the mainland . He also urged Hong Kong ' s politically divided community to forge consensus . " If Hong Kong tries , which I don ' t think it will , to make itself a bridgehead for revolutionary change in China , it will risk doing great damage to itself , " Howe , foreign secretary in former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ' s government when the Sino - British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong was signed in 1984 . Howe said the terms of the Joint Declaration cut both ways . Britain has promised to end over a century and a half of colonial rule and return Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30 , 1997 , now just 176 days away . China in return promised considerable autonomy for the people of Hong Kong under a " one country , two systems " principle by which capitalism would continue to prevail and socialism would not be imposed on the prosperous territory of six million . " Hong Kong is certainly entitled to have all its traditional way of life , its bill of rights , its legal protection through rule of law upheld without interference from the mainland , " Howe said in a interview with Radio Hong Kong . " The mainland is also entitled to say we can remain free of interference from Hong Kong . " Howe declined to get drawn into the bitter dispute dividing Hong Kong in the delicate countdown period to the transition . Hong Kong ' s democrats are up in arms over China ' s plans to dismantle the colony ' s elected legislature and replace it with an appointed provisional body . The Democratic Party , the largest in the legislature , and its allies will be kicked out of the chamber when the Provisional Legislature is installed , undoing at a stroke electoral reforms introduced by the British to China ' s fury . Democratic Party leaders have threatened to challenge the Provisional Legislature ' s constitutional right to exist , forcing it to plan to hold its meetings across the border in China . " There has to be a coming together of Hong Kong leaders if Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong , " Howe said . The outgoing British colonial administration has refused all cooperation with the provisional legislature but has pledged to assist Hong Kong ' s leader - designate , Tung Chee - hwa . Tung , selected overwhelmingly by a China - assembled panel last month , held working - level talks in Beijing this weekend with Chinese officials responsible for the transition . He did not disclose details of discussions concerning legality or otherwise of the chamber but said Beijing had agreed to foot the bill for the Provisional Legislature for the months leading up to the reversion of sovereignty . China would seek reimbursement from the post - colonial government , Tung told reporters in Beijing on Sunday . Tung said he would formulate a budget to cover the activities of the Provisional Legislature once he had chosen his " team - designate " , or the inner circles of Hong Kong ' s future administration . So far , Tung has invited only Hong Kong ' s popular and influential top civil servant Anson Chan to remain in her post and serve as his number two . He said he did not need Beijing ' s approval to make appointments . Tung will continue to meet senior civil servants this week . They serve as the equivalent of cabinet ministers elsewhere and most are expected to stay on in their posts .

Council of Europe might end Romania monitoring . Visiting Council of Europe observers said on Friday they might end monitoring of Romania following the country ' s recent democratic progress , but they expressed reservations about education rights and the treatment of homosexuals in the eastern European country . Gunnar Janson , who led the two - day review mission to Romania , said he would recommend at the Council ' s session in April that the monitoring should be concluded " as soon as possible " . Janson praised the country ' s smooth succession of power after last November ' s elections when ex - communists were ousted by a centrist coalition led by reformist President Emil Constantinescu . He urged Bucharest to improve protection measures for children and Gypsies , and strengthen education rights for ethnic groups , and said tough laws against homosexuals were a breach of human rights . " The article in the penal code against homosexuals violates Romania ' s constitution and international principles , " he said . Last year parliament voted to change the penal code , imposing jail sentences of up to five years for homosexuals if they cause " a public scandal " . Romania became a full member of the Council of Europe club of Western democracies in 1993 when it pledged to improve its democratic record .

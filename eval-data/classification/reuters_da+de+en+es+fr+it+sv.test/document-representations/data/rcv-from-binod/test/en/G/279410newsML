Rebel cause strikes chord in Peru , not methods . Most Peruvians abhor guerrilla violence , but many also see the latest gun - toting protest by Marxist rebels holding VIP hostages as a timely wake - up call to the increasingly unpopular President Alberto Fujimori that all is not well . Mass demonstrations against the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels , who on Sunday still held 83 hostages under the gun at the Japanese ambassador ' s residence , have clearly shown many Peruvians ' disgust for the guerrillas ' methods . But , in a country where half of the 24 million inhabitants live in poverty and most of the workforce is without a proper job , the rebels ' cry for a fairer Peru has also struck a chord among those who perhaps prefer not to protest themselves . " We Peruvians are generally passive - - too passive . In a way , subconsciously , I think this is something the people want . While the majority keep quiet , the terrorists are making the protest for us , " housewife Carmen Rodriguez told Reuters . The hostage crisis has highlighted growing dissatisfaction with the government and its economic reforms . " The attack in itself is despicable , " nurse Jose Melgar said . " But what they ( the guerrillas ) are doing is not 100 percent bad . They are alerting the authorities to the fact that they cannot just govern for the rich . " Since taking office in 1990 , Fujimori has been lauded by the international financial community for turning around an economy that was on the brink of chaos . But the average Peruvian has yet to receive much benefit from the recovery , and Fujimori ' s failure to reduce high levels of poverty and unemployment have brought him crashing 30 percentage points in the polls this year . However , the uncompromising leader still has his backers , who accuse the guerrillas of derailing the president ' s successful work . " The terrorists make us hang our head in shame . They have destroyed the image of our country - - an image that Fujimori with the economic recovery had gradually been improving ever since he entered the presidency , " taxi driver Armando Orellana said . A chief reason Fujimori won re - election in 1995 with an overwhelming 64 percent of the vote was his determined role in the capture of rebel leaders that led the electorate to believe he had practically put an end to the guerrilla wars , which that have cost 30 , 000 lives . But now some Peruvians feel betrayed by the president ' s exaggerated claims that the 16 years of conflicts were over . First Peru ' s larger guerrilla group , the Maoist Shining Path , blew a hole in the myth that they were defeated with a series of coordinated attacks earlier this year that forced Fujimori to acknowlege the problem would continue " for several years . " And then 12 days ago , about 20 heavily armed rebels from the almost forgotten MRTA stormed onto the world ' s front pages with their assault at the Japanese embassy . " It was totally false to say the terrorists were finished . They are like a colony of ants . You kill those you see but you cannnot kill those you cannot see . There are always more underground , " Melgar said . Both guerrilla groups dramatically lost grass - roots support during the 1980s because most deaths associated with their actions were civilian , and the rebels ' increasing ties with the illegal drugs trade lent them the stigma of common criminals . But the authorities do not appear to be winning the propaganda war in the current crisis . Officials have leaked allegations that the rebels tortured hostages and have offered journalists video evidence of MRTA atrocities . But the rebels ' meticulous orchestration of the embassy siege and testimony from released hostages of gentlemanly treatment by their captors have numbed the usual repulsion at the guerrillas ' methods , and even won respect from some . " In my opinion the government are worse terrorists than the MRTA , " Aguilar said . " The government only concerns itself with investors abroad , with foreign governments . It ignores its own people here . "

White S . African assassin calls for forgiveness . The white rightist who targeted Communist leader Chris Hani for assassination urged forgiveness across the political spectrum , saying on Friday that South Africans on both sides of the apartheid divide were victims of the past . " There can be no fingers pointed , only deep sympathy for those bereaved of loved ones and hopefully forgiveness all round , " Clive Derby - Lewis , 61 , a far - right Conservative Party politician , told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . " The war is over and it is time we turned to peaceful methods for the resolution of our problems and differences . Let us learn from the lessons of the past rather than to cause that those who have died did so in vain . " In earlier testimony on Friday , he solicited the help of the truth commission to speak to Hani ' s widow , Limpho , adding that he had also asked his lawyers to try to set up a meeting . " I requested permission to meet Mrs Hani in the spirit of reconciliation . . . I would like to place that on record as an official request , when I will personally express my sympathy to Mrs Hani and her children , " he said . Limpho Hani shrugged off the request , telling reporters : " The statement he made was not for me . It was for the press . " Asked why she had not reacted visibly to his testimony , she said : " What do you expect from someone whose husband was killed in cold blood by the man ? " Derby - Lewis , who provided the gun that killed Hani , and communist - hating Polish immigrant Janusz Walus , who carried out the assassination , were sentenced to death for the slaying on Easter weekend of 1993 . Their sentences were later commuted to life in jail . The pair now hope to convince the truth commission , which is probing human rights abuses perpetrated under white rule , that they had a political motive for the crime , that they have confessed in full and that they deserve amnesty . But the family of Hani , who was second only to President Nelson Mandela as a popular hero , fiercely opposes freedom for his killers . Derby - Lewis , dapper and upright in a grey suit , testified on Friday that his detention prior to his trial was his worst experience yet and harsher even than the military training he had once undergone . " It was the worse experience of my life , " he said . " I have never felt as insecure in my life before as I was then . I was constantly nervous because I never knew what was coming next . " Hani ' s murder was the most prominent in modern South African history and sent the country to the edge of the abyss , as the plotters had hoped . But Mandela and then president F . W . de Klerk scuppered their hopes by keeping the peace talks on track . Historic elections brought majority rule a year later .

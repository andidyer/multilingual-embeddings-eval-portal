HK land auction seen attracting smaller developers . Hong Kong ' s government land auction next Wednesday is seen attracting active bidding from small and medium sized developers , property analysts said on Thursday . Two plots are up for auction , both earmarked for non - industrial usage . The most interest is likely to be shown in the site located in the rapidly developing Yuen Long district of the New Territories . The other is on the outlying island of Lantau , which limits its attractiveness , analysts said . They forecast the 4 , 206 square metre Yuen Long site at the junction of Tai Yuk Road and Ma Tin Road would fetch between HK $ 260 million and HK $ 320 million . The 720 square metre site in Mui Wo on Lantau Island is expected to sell for between HK $ 12 million and HK $ 27 million , they said . Major developers may find the sites unattractive because most already hold substantial land banks in the New Territories and are unlikely to be looking to add smaller plots to their reserves . " Small to medium sized developers are expected to be the active bidders due to the relatively small area of the sites , " said Winnie Chiu , property analyst at DBS Securities . She said the auction prices would not be regarded as indicative of market levels . " It will give a positive view on market sentiment if developers actively bid for the site but it is not likely to give a direction or indication on market prices , " Chiu said . " The site in Mui Wo is unexciting because the site is small in size and is on an outlying island , " Lau said . " As the site is limited to commercial purposes and is not for residential use , we don ' t see any huge demand , " said Serena Lau , managing director of Francis Lau & Co ( Surveyors ) Ltd . - - Hong Kong Newsroom ( 852 ) 2843 6370

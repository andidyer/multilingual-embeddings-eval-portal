Ct Lyonnais in talks to sell Venezuelan bank stake . French bank Credit Lyonnais said on Thursday it talking to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya ( BBV ) about selling the Spanish bank its 17 percent stake in Venezuela ' s biggest bank , Banco Provincial . A spokesman for the state - controlled French bank which has been struggling to boost its profitability after several years of big losses said no deal had yet been struck . On Wednesday , a BBV spokesman said the bank was interested in Banco Provincial as well as other financial institutions in Venezuela . Earlier this week , Banco Provincial denied that BBV had bought a majority holding in the bank in which financier George Soros also holds a stake . Sale of its stake in the Venezuelan bank would allow Credit Lyonnais to achieve its goal of selling its retail banking interests in Latin America . It has already made a number of similar disposals in Chile , Peru , Brazil and Argentina . The disposals were ordered by the European Commission in exchange for its approval of French state aid to the bank . Credit Lyonnais , however , will maintain its merchant bank activities in Latin America . - - Paris Newsroom + 33 1 4221 5452

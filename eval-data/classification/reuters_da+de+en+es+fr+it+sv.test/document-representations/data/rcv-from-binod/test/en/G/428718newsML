Buser leads Iditarod mushers up Yukon River . Two - time champion Martin Buser , fuelled by a gourmet dinner served to him a day earlier in a remote Athabaskan Indian village , was in the lead Saturday in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race . Buser was ahead as the leaders pushed through a 148 - mile stretch up the frozen Yukon River , part of the winding wilderness trail that runs 1 , 161 miles from Anchorage to Nome . Buser departed Eagle Island , a checkpoint 732 miles into the race course , at 9 : 38 a . m . ( 1 : 38 p . m . EST ) . He was followed 82 minutes later by 1995 race champion Doug Swingley , of Lincoln , Montana . The Swiss - born Buser , of Big Lake , Alaska , reaped a scrumptious reward for being the first musher to reach the Yukon River . In the Athabaskan village of Anvik , 78 miles before Eagle Island , Buser was treated Friday to a special dinner . The seven - course meal was prepared by an Anchorage hotel chef flown in for the occasion . Meanwhile Saturday , two - time champion Jeff King , a previous race leader , was slowed by illness . The Denali , Alaska , musher was in third place early Saturday , arriving at Eagle Island at 9 : 30 a . m . ( 1 : 30 p . m . EST ) . DeeDee Jonrowe , the top woman in the Iditarod competition , arrived at Eagle Island 13 minutes behind King . Jonrowe , of Willow , Alaska , has been running this year ' s Iditarod despite severe shoulder and abdomen injuries suffered in a head - on auto collision earlier this winter . That November crash killed Jonrowe ' s step - grandmother and put Jonrowe into the intensive care unit at a Fairbanks hospital . The Iditarod began a week ago with a ceremonial run from downtown Anchorage . Of the 53 mushers who began the race , four had dropped out as of Saturday .

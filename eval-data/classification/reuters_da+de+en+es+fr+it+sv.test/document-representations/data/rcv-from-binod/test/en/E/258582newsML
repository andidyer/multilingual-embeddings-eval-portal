RBNZ not content with inflation close to 3 percent . Reserve Bank governor Don Brash said on Tuesday the bank would not be content with projecting inflation at or close to the new target band ' s upper limit of 3 . 0 percent . He said the move to a target inflation band of 0 - 3 percent from 0 - 2 percent meant a small change to the bank ' s aiming point ' to 1 . 5 percent from 1 . 0 percent . The change was made as part of the coalition deal between the conservative National Party and the nationalist New Zealand First Party announced last week . " We will assuredly not be content with projecting inflation at or close to three percent , " Brash said . He said it would be important over the next few months in particular that the bank did nothing to encourage a ratcheting up of inflationary expectations , given many of the public previously regarded the bank ' s task as keeping inflation below two percent . He said the increase in the ceiling to three percent may increase inflationary expectations not by 0 . 5 percent , the increase in the mid - point , but by one percent . As part of the coalition deal , the NZ $ 1 billion in cuts due to take place in July 1997 have been deferred but government spending has increased by $ 1 . 2 billion . Brash said the government ' s plans represented a significantly more restrained fiscal stance than many in the market has expected , and was a major reason for the sharp easing in monetary conditions following the announcement of the coalition . " But it is important not to lose sight of the fact that it nevertheless represents a considerable increase in the extent of fiscal stimulus as compared to that embodied in the previous projections , particularly in 1998 / 99 and 1999 / 00 , " Brash said . He said the referendum on compulsory superannuation to be held in 1997 made it difficult to assess the implications of the new track , because if a compulsory scheme was put in place it would significantly offset the projected fiscal stimulus . The referendum will be in the third quarter of 1997 . " We will not know whether or not the compulsory scheme will be going ahead until well within the time that the bank should be adjusting policy to take account of projected inflation in 1998 / 99 , " Brash said . He said the bank had not yet determined how it would handle this matter . Brash said the coalition ' s plan to increase the minimum wage from $ 6 . 375 to $ 7 an hour , review the minimum wage for those under 20 years of age and possibly to increase the mimimum wage to $ 7 . 50 in March 1998 seemed likely to increase unit labour costs , especially in labour - intensive industries , and would accordingly add to inflationary pressures . - - Wellington newsroom 64 4 473 4746

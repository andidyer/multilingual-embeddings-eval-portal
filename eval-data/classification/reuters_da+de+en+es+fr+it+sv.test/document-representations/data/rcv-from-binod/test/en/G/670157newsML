Plants replace Hong Kong homeless before handover . Hong Kong authorities have cleared the homeless from city - centre areas ahead of the globally - televised June 30 handover to China , a newspaper said on Wednesday . Dozens of street - sleepers who lived under a flyover have been removed , together with their chairs , canvas beds and paraffin stoves , the South China Morning Post said . In their place are greens and a new iron fence , it said . At midnight on June 30 , Prince Charles will return Hong Kong , which Britain has ruled for 156 years , to President Jiang Zemen in an event witnessed by VIPS and journalists from all over the world . A Social Welfare Department spokesman was quoted as denying the clearance had anything to do with the ceremony .

Yeltsin to speak on NATO , spend time in country . President Boris Yeltsin will speak on a range of topics including relations with NATO in a television interview with government - controlled Russian Television on Wednesday , the Kremlin said in a statement . A spokesman also said Yeltsin would then spend some time at his Rus country residence at Zavidovo , 100 km ( 60 miles ) west of Moscow , before returning to the Kremlin in time to meet U . N . Secretary - General Kofi Annan at midday on Saturday . The interview , scheduled for 8 . 30 p . m . ( 1630 GMT ) , will also touch on a planned charter amplifying last month ' s union treaty with Belarus , an assessment of the government , state housing reform and the peace deal signed on Monday with Chechen rebels . Russian and NATO officials announced on Wednesday they had struck a deal on forging a new relationship between the alliance and Moscow , despite Russia ' s continuing strong objections to NATO plans to admit former Soviet - bloc states in eastern Europe . It was not clear if Yeltsin recorded the interview before or after the announcement of the deal . Yeltsin , 66 , rarely gives television interviews . Those he has given , such as last September when he announced he would have heart bypass surgery , have been tightly managed affairs . The president had been widely expected to go on television to discuss the planned charter to the union treaty with western neighbour Belarus , which is expected to be signed on May 23 . Russian Television broadcast an interview with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday .

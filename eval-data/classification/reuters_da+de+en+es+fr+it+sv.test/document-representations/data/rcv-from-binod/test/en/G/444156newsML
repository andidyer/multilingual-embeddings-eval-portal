Japan to send top official to Peru , Cuba , Dominica . Japan said on Friday a top Japanese foreign ministry official will visit Peru , Cuba and the Dominican Republic next week to discuss the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima . Vice foreign minister Masahiko Komura will leave Tokyo on Monday for a one - week visit to the three countries , chief government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told reporters . After meeting Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori , Komura is expected to visit Cuba and the Dominican Republic to seek their cooperation if Marxist rebels agree to go into exile in a country outside Peru , Kajiyama said . " There is a valid reason for visiting those nations after visiting Peru , and one can say such coordination will take place , " Kajiyama said . " It is time for making such preparations . Progress is underway , " Kajiyama said . Fujimori made a surprise trip to Cuba to meet Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana in early March , after which Castro said he was willing to accept the rebels . Talks between the rebels and the Peruvian government to end the 12 - week hostage standoff are plodding along with little visible progress . Mediators met on Thursday with the leader of the Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages at the Japanese ambassador ' s home in Lima for about an hour . But the mediators , members of a three - man guarantors commission , gave no sign of any progress in the talks and did not say when the next round of negotiations might be .

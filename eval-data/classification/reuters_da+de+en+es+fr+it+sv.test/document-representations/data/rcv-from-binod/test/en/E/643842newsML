FORECAST - UK manufacturing to rebound in April . British manufacturing output is forecast to have bounced back in April following a dip in March , but some economists said the pick - up may prove shortlived with the rampant pound yet to take its toll on exporters . A Reuter poll of economists forecast a 0 . 3 percent rise in output in April compared with a 0 . 1 percent fall in March , leaving it 2 . 0 percent higher than a year ago , despite the fact that the pound ' s rally remains unfettered . Industrial production - - which measures output from both manufacturers and the energy production industries - - is also expected to rise 0 . 3 percent and 1 . 6 percent year - on - year . The figures will be released at 0830 GMT on Monday . Jonathan Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets , said manufacturers ' struggle in March showed the sharp appreciation of sterling - - up about 18 percent on a trade - weighted basis since last August and squeezing exporters as it goes - - was finally having an impact . He said the Confederation of British Industry ' s last monthly trends survey showed the steepest fall in exports in three years . " At the very least this points to a more modest rate of output growth . And if the balance fails to rebound , the threat of a renewed downturn in industry could start to look very real , " he said . But for last month , a rebound can reasonably be expected . Loynes forecast a 0 . 3 percent increase . " And with output having fallen sharply last April , this should boost the annual growth rate up to 2 . 1 percent , the highest since June 1995 . " Analysts at Goldman Sachs also forecast a revival for manufacturers in April . They said there was little evidence that the pound was hurting them unduly . Goldman forecast a 0 . 2 percent increase in manufacturing in the month and noted that on a three - month annualised basis , manufacturing rose by 2 . 4 percent in March , despite the monthly drop . " Manufacturing output . . . is still on a steady upward trend , " they said in a client note . " And with service sector activity growing more strongly than manufacturing , GDP is comfortable being maintained at an above - trend rate . " Writing before Britain ' s new monetary policy committee raised base rates by a quarter - point to 6 . 5 percent on Friday , the Goldman analysts said more monetary tightening was needed . Top employers organisation , the Confederation of British Industry disagreed . Chief economist Kate Barker said she was disappointed with Friday ' s rate rise . " The central policy dilemma simply isn ' t going to go away , " chief economist Kate Barker told the BBC . " Consumer spending is likely to be pretty strong . . . but exports are likely to continue to have a very tough time . We hope therefore that further rate rises can be kept to a minimum . " But economists said manufacturing weakness alone was not enough to delay the need for tighter policy . David Smith , UK economist at Williams de Broe , said Britain ' s manufacturing sector now accounted for just 23 . 25 percent of GDP . He forecast that it grew by just 0 . 1 percent in March . For industrial production as a whole , Loynes said a hefty rebound in energy production in April and stronger energy supply , rebounding after unseasonally warm weather earlier in the year , would lead to a robust increase overall . " Accordingly , we expect total output to register a chunky 0 . 6 percent month - on - month increase . " - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5109

S & P may downgrade four UK cable companies . Standard & Poor ' s said on Thursday it had placed its ratings on four British cable companies on CreditWatch with negative implications . " This action reflects Standard & Poor ' s view that industry fundamentals have weakened which could impact the financial prospects of the sector over the medium to longer term , resulting in a slower rate of improvement in credit measures than previously expected , " S & P said in a statement . The companies are Diamond Cable Communications Plc , Telewest Communications Plc , International CableTel Inc and Comcast UK Cable Partners Ltd . S & P said its concerns included mixed consumer acceptance of the cable / telephony product to date , slower than anticipated network buildouts , and ongoing competitive pressures from alternative delivery systems ( BSkyB , and in the future , digital terrestrial television ) , as well as from telephone companies , including British Telecommunications Plc . " Although the industry is beginning to turn EBITDA positive , it is about a year behind Standard & Poor ' s expectations , " the agency said . " In addition , higher - than - anticipated capital spending and the delay in operating cash flow generation , have resulted in greater - than - expected debt levels , increasing financial risk . " Cash interest coverages for several UK cable operators have been generally below 1 . 0 times to date , and are not expected to surpass this level for another year or two , " S & P said . " Notwithstanding its concerns about the UK cable industry , Standard & Poor ' s acknowledges that the individual strategies and performance can vary significantly , " the agency said . Standard & Poor ' s said its ratings on cable companies Bell Cablemedia and Videotron Holdings Plc were unaffected by this CreditWatch action and remained on CreditWatch with positive implications , where they were placed on October 2 , 1996 . " These latter CreditWatch placements reflect Standard & Poor ' s expectations that their ratings will be bolstered by a degree of implied support from their prospective new owner , Cable & Wireless ( A - 1 ' commercial paper rating ) , which helps offset Standard & Poor ' s concerns about the UK cable industry , " the agency said . The CreditWatch placements will be resolved upon conclusion of Standard & Poor ' s review of the UK cable industry , which is expected to occur within the next six to eight weeks , and which will include meetings with management . " The CreditWatch resolution will result in each company ' s ratings being affirmed or lowered . If ratings are lowered , adjustments are not expected to be more than one notch , " S & P said .

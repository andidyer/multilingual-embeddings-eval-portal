British forces in Northern Ireland launched a security clampdown in an Irish nationalist stronghold in Belfast on Saturday after making overnight arrests . Soldiers and police sealed off a house in the Whiterock area in the west of the city but declined to say if guerrilla weapons had been found . Police said that a security operation that started when they were called to a house late on Friday was still underway but declined to give further details . " A number of persons were taken into custody , " a spokesman said . Residents said at least five people had been arrested at the house . The city ' s Irish News newspaper said local people had complained about " heavy - handedness " by the security forces . It reported that police and soldiers had mounted several large - scale raids for arms in the run - up to Christmas . Three weeks ago they uncovered a haul of suspected IRA guerrilla morars , incendiary devices and ammunition . The operation comes at a time of heightened tension after attacks by Irish Republican Army guerrillas opposed to British rule , and fears that a two - year - old ceasefire by pro - British Loyalist foes may be over .

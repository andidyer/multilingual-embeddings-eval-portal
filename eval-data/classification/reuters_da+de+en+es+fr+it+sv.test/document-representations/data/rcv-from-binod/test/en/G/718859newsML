NATO war crimes crackdown panics Bosnian Serbs . NATO ' s pounce on two indicted war criminals in Bosnia on Thursday raised expectations that the biggest fish - - Bosnian Serb wartime chief Radovan Karadzic and army commander General Ratko Mladic - - might be next . NATO officers in Sarajevo would not say if " Operation Tango " was completed after they detained one suspect and shot dead another who resisted arrest in Bosnian Serb territory . But the unprecedented NATO action sent shock waves through the nationalist Serb leadership in the mountain village of Pale , outside Sarajevo . Bosnian Serb television , under the control of Karadzic , struck a panicked tone . " What we were afraid of happened , the threats from the international community materialised , " the television said . The arrest operation showed for the first time since the Bosnia ' s peace treaty was signed in late 1995 that Western countries were willing to take action to back up tough rhetoric on the prosecution of war crimes in the Balkans . Scores of people indicted by the international war - crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia remain at large . U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , herself a refugee during World War Two , came into office vowing to make war crimes issues " a high priority " . The NATO operation provided evidence that she was making headway . Alliance countries meeting in Madrid this week discussed Karadzic ' s continuing influence but there was no announcement that the peacekeeping mission ' s mandate had changed . NATO has said it will only arrest those suspects it encounters during regular duties and said the two suspects targeted had been spotted before by British troops in the area . But the operation appeared well - planned and signalled the alliance was ready to take risks to shore up the fragile peace . The operation also came at a time when one of the most prominent war crimes suspects , Karadzic , has been blamed for trying to wreck Bosnia ' s peace agreement by trying to topple the postwar Bosnian Serb president . Until Thursday , NATO officers had privately spoken about the danger of going after indicted war criminals . If the mission went badly , they said , there could be casualties - - a virtual political taboo in the United States which has thousands of peace troops in Bosnia . NATO officers have also expressed concern that arresting Karadzic or Mladic might provoke a violent backlash against their own troops stationed on Serb territory . There was no immediate backlash on Thursday and the Bosnian Serb army already has to submit to strict NATO supervision under terms of the peace treaty . Alliance officers said peacekeeping troops were not on any heightened alert and insisted there was no plan to evacuate hundreds of foreigners working as aid workers , police monitors or election supervisors in Serb territory . When NATO aircraft bombed Serb positions during the Bosnian war , Serb forces abducted U . N . soldiers and used them as " human shields " . The tribunal later indicted Mladic and Karadzic for hostage - taking as well . The suspects that British soldiers went after on Thursday were not small fry . They were powerful men charged with organising an " ethnic cleansing " campaign that deported hundreds of thousands of Moslems and Croats from north Bosnia . Human rights workers say arresting prominent suspects such as Karadzic and Mladic is crucial for building post - war reconciliation among Moslem , Croat and Serb communities . Mladic , accused of ordering the massacre of Moslem men after the fall of Srebrenica two years ago , has kept out of the public eye since he retired as commander of the Bosnian Serb army . His family lives in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade , where he was seen strolling through the city centre on Wednesday . If he stays away from Bosnia , he may succeed in avoiding the fate of the Serb warlords in Prijedor . Karadzic , who stepped down from all public offices a year ago under international pressure , has continued to dominate Serb politics behind the scenes in defiance of Western powers . He drew attention to himself this month in trying to sabotage an attempt by his successor as Bosnian Serb president , Biljana Plavsic , to expose alleged corruption linked to companies he runs . Karadzic and his deputies once led a comfortable , insulated existence in Pale as their army pounded Sarajevo with artillery shells and expelled Moslems and Croats to make way for a purely Serb state in the ashes of Bosnia . U . S . helicopters buzzing over Pale now are a constant reminder to Karadzic that the net may be closing in .

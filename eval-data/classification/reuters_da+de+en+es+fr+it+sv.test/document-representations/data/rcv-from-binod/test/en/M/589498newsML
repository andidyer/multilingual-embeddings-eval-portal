IPE oil futures soar in late trading to $ 20 . 35 . IPE Brent crude oil futures soared in late trading on Friday , pushed up to two - month highs by institutional funds buying WTI futures in the United States and technical factors , brokers said . The front month July contract last traded at $ 20 . 35 a barrel , up 86 cents on yesterday ' s close , while New York ' s July paper last traded at $ 22 . 10 , up an equally hefty 80 cents on the day . Both contracts broke through stubborn resistance levels while Brent hit levels not seen since March 19 , when it briefly traded at $ 20 . 84 . " There was heavy fund buying on the WTI and we ' re just following it up , " said one dealer . " The volume really picked up . " Brent ' s high on the day was $ 20 . 60 before profit taking pared gains back . The rise repeated sharp upturns seen last Friday and on Monday , when technical stops triggered on charts helped values to soar by nearly $ 1 . " The chart looked like it was going to break - up all week and for it not to happen till now was really smart , " said one broker . " Its a late Friday , there ' s nobody watching and there was nobody there to counter it . " Brent had earlier traded quietly in a narrow range and activity really only picked up around 1700 gmt , just two and a quarter hours before the close . Gas oil had earlier settled very quietly , just $ 1 up at $ 173 . 25The rise continued the remarkable bull run begun last week , which saw crude break out of the $ 17 . 50 - $ 18 . 50 range it was stuck in after falling sharply from early year highs of $ 25 . Friday ' s close is just above last year ' s average price of $ 20 . 32 , a level many analysts had speculated was unreachable in current conditions of plentiful supply and poor demand . " We have a technical breakout . It could be an ascending triangle or a pennant . Call it what you will . It adds up to the same thing , " said energy analyst Thomas Blakeslee at Cargill Investor services in New York . Once resistance levels were trampled on Brent , WTI and on the New York unleaded contract , there was little to stop numbers soaring , dealers said . " Last time we were in this territory we moved quiet fast . I won ' t be able to tell where the top is until at least an hour after opening on Monday morning , " said one broker . - London newsroom + 44 171 542 8060

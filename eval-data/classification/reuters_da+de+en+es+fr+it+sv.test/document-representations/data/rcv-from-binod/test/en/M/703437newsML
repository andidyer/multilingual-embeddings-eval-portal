London gold fixed at lowest since March 24 , 1993 . The gold price fixed at $ 331 . 45 per ounce on Wednesday , its lowest fixing since March 24 , 1993 . On Tuesday an already crumbling price was fixed at $ 333 . 70 , recording its lowest level in 4 - 1 / 4 years . " There should be some buying support at $ 330 . 00 . A fall through that level would be a big psychological blow for the market , " one analyst said . Gold has been weakening for months under the threat of selling from European central banks looking to their gold reserves as a means of easing them into European Monetary Union in 1999 . As the price has fallen , gold producers especially in high cost areas like Australia have been stepping up sales in an attempt to avoid even lower prices . " There is not even physical buying here , but that might be because the Hong Kong market is closed for the handover of the territory to China , " one market analyst said . - - Brian Spoors , London Newsroom + 44 171 5452 8058

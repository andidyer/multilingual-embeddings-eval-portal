Amplats sees China as new platinum frontier . Anglo American Platinum Corp Ltd ( Amplats ) said on Monday it saw China as a new exciting platinum market and held high hopes for Chinese demand to increase in future . Amplats commercial director Dorian Emmett told a mining conference organised by stockbroker E . W . Balderson that platinum demand in China had grown from 20 , 000 ounces in 1993 to 200 , 000 last year . " Our experience in the last couple of years has illustrated that this must be the market which we hold very high hopes for in the platinum industry , " he said . Platinum demand in China was about 60 percent jewellery demand and 40 percent industrial demand , Emmett said . He said the industry in the past had done very little promotion work in China because the country already had a culture of platinum jewellery . " Certainly this year we ploughed promotional money in of significance together with the other producers . " Platinum jewellery growth was encouraging especially outside the traditional Japanese jewellery market , Emmett said , adding that Amplats also saw favourable long - term prospects for platinum use in new fuel cell technology . Amplats - - which produces 35 percent of the world ' s platinum - - has predicted steady growth in platinum demand of around two percent per year to 2010 . It put global demand in 1996 at around five million ounces . Emmett said Russian supplies exceeded production over the past few years and this was the main factor behind soft platinum prices . " The net Russian effect has been of a net surplus . We all agree the market was reasonably awash with platinum , certainly at the end of last year . " The Russians continued to supply from stock and we have a significant accumulated surplus , " he said . He said Amplats aimed to expand into the platinum supply gap as Russian supplies diminished . Amplats announced a major expansion programme earlier this year , including a new mine at Boschkoppie and expansion of its operations at Potgietersrust Platinums Ltd . - - Marius Bosch , Johannesburg newsroom , + 27 - 11 482 1003

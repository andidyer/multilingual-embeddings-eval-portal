Hun Sen ' s forces push opposition back in north . Troops under Second Prime Minister Hun Sen were beating back forces loyal to Cambodia ' s ousted co - premier in fighting in the northwest on Saturday . Reporters with Hun Sen ' s government troops said they were advancing along the key highway in the region bordering Thailand , Route 6 , exchanging rocket , mortar , artillery and occasional small arms fire with the retreating troops . Two bridges were completely destroyed along the road , which links the tourist town of Siem Reap , home of the Angkor Wat temple complex , to the market town of Poipet on the Thai border . Local people said one of the bridges was destroyed by Hun Sen ' s troops to prevent opposition forces , believed to comprise both Khmer Rouge guerrillas and troops loyal to ousted co - Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh , from advancing on Siem Reap . The second , larger bridge was destroyed by opposition forces as they retreated . Advancing government troops had two tanks and several score of infantry and the scene was reminiscent of other battles over decades of war in the region , with tanks advancing down the main road and infantry , many barefoot and carrying AK - 47 and M - 16 rifles , advancing through the rice paddies to either side . A truck - mounted multiple rocket launcher was firing in the afternoon , its rockets like pin - pricks of light racing towards opposition lines on the west side of the Plang river . Most of the village of Sor Sadam was deserted after fighting on Friday while the village of Plang was being evacuated by civilians on foot and motorcycle east to Siem Reap . " This morning I heard the sound of fighting at about six o ' clock . It was very intense , very heavy , the Khmer Rouge were shelling Plang district , " said Noung Saming , a 47 - year - old farmer fleeing Plang on a motorcycle with his wife , son and two bags of rice . " I ' m not sure how long it will last but I ' m worried because I left a lot of my belongings at my house and I ' m afraid someone will steal them , " he said . At least two more tanks , two trucks and pick - up trucks full of soldiers were racing towards the frontline from Siem Reap at 1 . 00 p . m . ( 0600 GMT ) . The fighting was not intense . As government forces advanced west , infantry ahead of tanks used mine - sweepers to uncover mines in the road . Hun Sen , whose forces ousted the democratically elected Ranariddh during two days of fighting in Phnom Penh last weekend , said on Saturday that the war was over as his rivals could not rally people to their cause .

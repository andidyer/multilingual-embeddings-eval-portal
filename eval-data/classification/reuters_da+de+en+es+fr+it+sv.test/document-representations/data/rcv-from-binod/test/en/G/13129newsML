Bosnia peace process could stumble , diplomats warn . Diplomats in the Balkans are warning that the Bosnian peace process which began in Dayton last year is at risk of stumbling badly by insisting on the form but not the content of democracy . They say the mere casting of ballots in Bosnia - wide elections on September 14 , a key pillar of the Dayton agreement that ended 43 months of war , will not by itself solve the country ' s problems . " A lot of little lies have been told in Bosnia which are now culminating in the big lie of allegedly democratic elections , " said a Western diplomat in Sarajevo who asked not to be named . " The scheming and mendacity of the Bosnian factions is no surprise . But the history of the West ' s involvement in Bosnia since the war began is also to say one thing and do another , to make a pledge and fail to deliver . Dayton is no exception . " Many international observers feel that with key parts of the Dayton still unfulfilled , the basic reforms necessary to support democratic elections are not in place . What was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi - ethnic state is seen by critics as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure . Having suffered through Europe ' s worst war in half a century in which some 200 , 000 people died , Bosnia ' s Moslems , Croats and Serbs took heart from the internationally - sanctioned Dayton peace agreement signed in December 1995 . Dayton guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes , ensured freedom of movement and served notice that indicted war criminals would be brought to justice before a U . N . tribunal at the Hague . Substantial responsibility for this post - war programme was assigned to the former warring factions , but more than 50 , 000 NATO - led combat troops and 1 , 600 U . N . police were also despatched to Bosnia to seal the deal . Hordes of western bureaucrats also descended on the country to rebuild roads , bridges , housing and government institutions . The promise and the premise of the Dayton peace agreement were that justice and human rights , capped by democratic elections , were the balm for the Bosnian war and the basis for long - term peace and reconciliation . NATO quickly separated the formerly warring factions and got the armies back to barracks - - no mean feat . But then NATO troops began patrolling what was supposed to be an administrative and porous boundary line between Bosnia ' s two halves , its Moslem - Croat federation and its Serb republic . This helped to turn the boundary line into a border , which was exactly what the separatist Serbs wanted . Refusing to assume policing duties , NATO said it was up to U . N . police monitors and local Bosnian police to facilitate freedom of movement and the return of refugees across the " Inter - Entity Boundary Line . " Unarmed U . N . police lacked the muscle . Local police , in the service of whichever nationalist party controlled their area , far from contributing to a new freedom of movement actually blocked it . The round - up of war criminals fared no better than freedom of movement or the return of refugees . NATO refused to engage in manhunts and seemed at times to go out of its way to avoid encountering indictees . Eight months after Dayton was signed , former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and his army commander General Ratko Mladic - - both indicted for war crimes by the Hague tribunal - - remain at large in the midst of a massive NATO deployment . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) is the post - Cold War , trans - Atlantic combine charged with supervising Bosnian elections on September 14 . OSCE recently concluded and publicly announced that conditions for free and fair elections in Bosnia do not exist , citing restrictions on freedom of movement , association and press and the inability of refugees to return to their homes . However the OSCE decided to proceed with elections nonetheless , saying there was a reasonable prospect they would be democratic .

Zedillo says Mexico vote to be historically clean . President Ernesto Zedillo pledged on Wednesday that Mexico , a country with a tainted past of electoral fraud , would conduct clean mid - term elections on July 6 . " It will be a historic day for Mexico because we will have taken the crucial step to the democratic standards that we all want , " Zedillo said in an interview with local television during a trip to the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca . Opinion polls predict that Zedillo ' s Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) will face the toughest contest of its 68 years in power in the elections for the lower house of Congress , a quarter of the Senate , six state governors and , for the first time in modern history , the mayor of Mexico City . In the Mexico City race , PRI candidate Alfredo del Mazo is running in a distant second or third place . In the congressional vote , the PRI runs the risk of losing its decades - old majority in the lower house . The opposition claims the PRI has maintained its grip on power for so long by resorting on occasion to electoral fraud . Zedillo , who has stood firmly behind the PRI during its campaign and frequently lambasted the opposition for protesting his policies , said the results would be respected . " The results will depend on the people , " he said . Government officials say recent electoral reforms , which include generous public funding for opposition parties and a voter credential with a photograph , will eliminate fraud . Critics say there could still be cheating in the counting of ballots .

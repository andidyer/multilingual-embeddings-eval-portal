IBCA assigns Saudi British Bank ratings . IBCA , the European credit rating agency said on Wednesday it assigned individual and legal ratings of B and 2 respectively to the Saudi British Bank . " Our legal rating of 2 reflects the strong supervisory regime in Saudi Arabia , and our opinion that in view of the limited number of banks in the banking sector it is likely that support would be provided by official sources , " IBCA said in a statement . Saudi British Bank ( SABB ) is 40 percent owned by HSBC Holdings BV , a wholly - owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings PLC , with the remaining 60 percent held by Saudi nationals , IBCA said . It is the sixth largest Saudi bank and the second largest joint venture bank in the Kingdom . It is a full service bank with retail and corporate activity , Islamic banking , private banking , credit cards and operates through a domestic network of 63 branches and 3 regional offices . Some key members of SABB ' s senior management , including the managing director and his deputy , have been seconded from various parts of the HSBC group , and SABB ' s IT systems , risk management methodologies and reporting requirements are consistent with those used by other HSBC group companies ; this expertise is one of the main reasons for SABB ' s position as one of the most profitable banks in the Kingdom . " The bank has a good quality loan portfolio , and a large proportion of other assets are in the form of government securities and interbank placements which results in a very liquid balance sheet , " IBCA said .

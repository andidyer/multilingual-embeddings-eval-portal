SOCCER - MONACO OUTCLASS MOENCHENGLADBACH . Classy goals by Scot John Collins , Nigerian Victor Ikpeba and youngster Thierry Henry helped Monaco upset Borussia Moenchengladbach 4 - 2 in their UEFA Cup second round first leg on Tuesday . Ikpeba made the score sheet twice as the Germans struggled to reproduce the same kind of crisp football which destroyed England ' s Arsenal in the last round . The French side opened the scoring in the 12th minute after a quick counter - attack . Ikpeba slipped the ball to Collins just outside the box and the Scottish midfielder fired it crisply into the left - hand corner with his left foot . Seconds after Christian Hochstaetter had equalised for the Germans in the 57th minute , Ikpeba raced down the left flank and beat two Borussia defenders and Moenchengladbach goalkeeper Uwe Kamps before firing home . Borussia seemed to have avoided defeat when a long - range free - kick from Swede Patrik Andersson found the net in the 72nd minute . But just six minutes later Henry showed his blistering speed down the left wing and scoredr . Henry went close again shortly afterwards after another sprint down the left but Kamps just managed to tip his shot over the bar . In the dying seconds Ikpeba beat the Borussia offside trap and struck the ball inside the right - hand post . " We were completely asleep in the first half , " said Moenchengladbach coach Bernd Krauss . " We saw what great players the French have . French football is probably ahead of the German game at the moment . "

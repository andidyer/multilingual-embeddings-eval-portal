FOCUS - Russia agrees more foreign investment in BES . President Boris Yeltsin gave his stamp of approval on Wednesday to increased foreign investment in Russia ' s biggest company , national power utility UES . Yeltsin approved a foreign - aimed convertible bond issue , Interfax news agency said , and rejected a bill limiting foreign holdings in UES to 25 percent of the firm ' s shares . That bill could have created stock market chaos since foreigners , who have snapped up UES stock and driven up the share price over five times this year to about 43 cents , already own 27 . 8 percent , according to the company ' s annual report . The bond , expected to be launched this autumn after a programme to allow trade of existing domestically - held shares on foreign exchanges , could move as much as five percent more of the company into foreign hands . Shareholders will meet on August 26 to vote on the bond . The price of shares in Unified Energy System ( UES ) rose as high as 43 cents during the day in anticipation that Yeltsin would sign the decree , from $ 0 . 4174 at the previous close on the Russian Trading System . Yeltsin ' s moves show a sharp liberalisation of Russian policy of safeguarding its strategic assets from foreign hands . The rejected bill would have required the government to maintain a majority stake , though that is government policy in any case . UES is the national electricity natural monopoly , with controlling stakes in almost every regional Russian power utility and direct stakes in power generating plants which supply about one quarter of the nation ' s electricity . It also owns the national power transmission grid and the wholesale electricity market , which federal regulators and company officials say will be opened up to consumers to increase competition and decrease industrial power rates . Interfax did not give details of the bond decree , which is expected to spell out issue parameters , but quoted First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov as saying it would raise five trillion roubles ( $ 870 million ) to pay wage arrears . Boris Brevnov , the 29 - year old chief executive of UES who accompanied Nemtsov to see the president , has said it would be an international issue and UES officials have said up to five percent of shares could be covered by it . The bond will be issued by UES , but some of the shares to be covered are government - owned and it appears some of the proceeds will go directly to the government , making the bond effectively a kind of option to buy government shares . The federal government has a 52 . 7 percent stake and up to 2 . 7 percent minus one share could be used in the bond programme , UES has said . Fifteen percent of authorised capital has never been issued as shares and up to 2 . 3 percent of company - controlled capital could be earmarked for the programme . UES has said it will launch a level - one American Depositary Receipt programme , which will allow shares to trade abroad and is likely to boost share price , before the bond is issued . The company has rushed this year to restructure , with strong guidance from the government , since the March appointment of Nemtsov , in charge of policy on natural monopolies such as UES .

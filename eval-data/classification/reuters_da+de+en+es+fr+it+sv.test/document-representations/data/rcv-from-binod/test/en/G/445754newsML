Mubarak excuses soft U . S . line on Jerusalem . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said U . S . politicians could not take a tough line on Israeli policy in Jerusalem because of domestic political pressures . " When you sit with the Congress people and the American president himself , you feel that they could be forced to take any measure for certain political circumstances , " he said in an interview broadcast on state television on Sunday . Mubarak was speaking in the Moroccan capital Rabat on Saturday morning on his way home from the United States where he saw President Bill Clinton , presidency sources said . Washington upset its Arab allies last week by vetoing a U . N . Security Council resolution condemning a new Israeli settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . The veto followed U . S . criticism of the Israeli decision to build 6 , 500 new homes for Jews on land occupied in 1967 . " That does not mean that the United States is not in favour of Arab rights and the Palestinian cause , " Mubarak said . " On the contrary , the United States is a main element in the peace process , an effective and basic element . " " But it ' s political conditions that make them do that , " he added , apparently in reference to the influence of pro - Israeli lobbying groups in Washington . Asked if he had a message for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , he said he would tell him peace was worth any concessions and extremism would only add to violence in the region . " I said this to ( former Israeli prime ministers ) Yitzhak Shamir , Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres . They understood the matter , perhaps because they had lots of experience , " he added , pausing without comparing them with Netanyahu . To Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , Mubarak said : " God help you , what else can I tell you . . . You must keep negotiating , don ' t despair and we must reach a solution . " The president supported Syria ' s position that Israel was unreasonable to propose resuming negotiations on the occupied Golan Heights from scratch . " Syria can never sit down and negotiate unless it knows in advance , not necessarily in a clear way but in another way or by any formula , that it will get its land , " Mubarak added .

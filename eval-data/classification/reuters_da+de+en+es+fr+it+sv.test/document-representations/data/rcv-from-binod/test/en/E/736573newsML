INSTANT VIEW - Canada June CPI up 1 . 8 pct on year . Following are reactions to consumer price index data released by Statistics Canada on Thursday . Canada ' s unadjusted June consumer price index rose 0 . 1 percent in the month and 1 . 8 percent in the year , Statistics Canada said Thursday . Core CPI rose 2 . 0 percent year - on - year . Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast , on average , the unadjusted CPI to rise 0 . 1 percent on the month . The survey also forecast a 1 . 7 percent year - over - year rise in the all - items index and a 1 . 8 percent increase in the core CPI . Mario Angastiniotis , economist , MMS International : " It means that the Bank of Canada still has room to stay on hold . There ' s no substantial pick - up in inflationary pressures . It ( CPI ) is still hovering within the middle of the target band . It ' s really no substantial change from previous months . " Michael Gregory , economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers : " The year - over - year number has drifted a little higher than what the market was looking for . It still is at or below the Bank ' s point target of 2 . 0 percent for inflation control , so that ' s not a big deal . I don ' t think at this stage this is going to convince the market that Bank of Canada tightening is imminent after yesterday ' s manufacturing report , which suggested the opposite . Andrew Pyle , economist with ABN - AMRO Hoare Govett : " I don ' t see anything in this release that is going to prompt the Bank of Canada to tighten . . . there ' s really no solid justification for it . Core inflation is probably going to be seen by some in the market as the most shocking ( number ) of all at 2 . 0 percent . It will probably cause a little bit of damage to bonds . It has marginally helped the Canadian dollar , but by 0900 EDT / 1300 GMT , we ' ll be watching the Bank of Canada , and I don ' t think you ' re going to see them tighten .

Surprise drop in U . S . trade gap seen aiding Q4 GDP . A surprising decline in the U . S . trade deficit in October should bolster overall domestic economic growth in the fourth quarter , but analysts said they were skeptical about the progress continuing in coming months . Economists hailed the drop in the trade gap , to $ 7 . 99 billion from a revised $ 11 . 4 billion in September , as a positive sign but said it probably represented a correction from exaggerated trade weakness earlier . " We saw some genuine progress , but I think the progress is overstated , " said Dan Seto of Nikko Securities International . Seto , senior economist at Nikko , cited a whopping 130 percent gain in civilian aircraft exports , which is almost certainly unsustainable , as a reason for tempering enthusiasm over the report . " A big portion of the gains came in aircraft , though we did see some improvement in other industries , " Seto said . Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a more modest trade gap decline . The average deficit forecast was $ 10 . 4 billion . As a result of the big drop , economists are looking for slightly better growth in U . S . real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter . " The net export picture dragged GDP down in the third quarter quite a bit . With the big jump in October , exports will be up in the fourth quarter and that ' s a source of strength for the economy , " said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Bank . Hoffman now sees fourth quarter GDP at the top of his original forecast range of 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 percent . " If we get a good enough holiday shopping season , we could talk about a ( GDP ) number as high as 2 . 5 percent . It ' s not likely to be below 2 . 0 percent , " he said . Exports surged 4 . 2 percent in October to $ 71 . 74 billion , while imports fell 0 . 7 percent to $ 79 . 72 billion . The politically sensitive U . S . trade deficit with Japan widened nearly 31 percent in October , to $ 4 . 96 billion , its highest level since August 1995 . Many U . S . firms have complained that the firming dollar , which is near a four - year high against the yen , has hurt the trade gap by making Japanese goods relatively less expensive . Immediately following the 0830 EST / 1330 GMT release of the trade data , the dollar rose sharply against many European currencies , but it made only a modest gain versus the yen . Analysts cited U . S . corporate competitiveness for reining in the trade gap despite weak economies in Europe and Asia that severely hamper U . S . export efforts . " American industry has become much more competitive . Unfortunately , our economy is one of the strongest globally and is still pulling in a lot of imports , " Seto said . The U . S . trade deficit with China rose a modest 3 . 5 percent to $ 4 . 90 billion in October . China and Japan have alternated as the largest net importer to the U . S . for the last several months .

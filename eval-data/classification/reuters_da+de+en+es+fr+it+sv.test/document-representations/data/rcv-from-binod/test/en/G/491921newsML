Turkey ' s Erbakan avoiding Israeli minister - embassy . Israel ' s ambassador accused Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Erbakan on Monday of trying to avoid meeting Israel ' s foreign minister when he visits this week to strengthen the ties sought by Turkey ' s secularist generals . Ambassador Zvi Elpeleg said Erbakan , modern Turkey ' s first Islamist leader , had ignored repeated requests for a meeting with Foreign Minister David Levy , who begins a two - day visit on Tuesday . Israel quickly distanced itself from the comments , saying the itinerary was up to Turkey . " The ambassador was never instructed to ask for the meeting and if he did , it was done without Levy ' s knowledge , " said an official in Jerusalem . Elpeleg said the reaction of the Turkish prime minister , head of the Islam - based Welfare Party , flew in the face of assurances from Erbakan aides they would not undermine growing defence , commercial and political ties . " I have received no response to my request three weeks ago to brief the prime minister on the Levy visit and no response on the Levy meeting itself , " Elpeleg told Reuters . " We have it from different channels that ( Erbakan ) is trying to slip away from such a meeting . " The embassy later said a meeting was still possible . " There is a possibility the foreign minister will meet the prime minister , " an embassy spokesman said . " We are hoping there will be a meeting . " The Israeli Foreign Ministry went further in moderating the tone : " The Turkish Foreign Ministry is the host and responsible for preparing the itinerary for the visit . Minister Levy will be glad if a meeting with Erbakan takes place but it depends on the hosts . " Analysts said any decision not to meet Levy would not only impinge on bilateral ties but would be seen as a fresh assertion by Erbakan of independence from the country ' s powerful armed forces , which are keen to expand cooperation with Israel . " Ties between the two countries grew out of enhanced military cooperation but they are now poised to take on a life of their own , " said a Western diplomat who monitors Turkey ' s policies toward the Middle East . " A setback on the political front will not please the army , " said the diplomat . Turkey ' s top brass are already engaged in a war of words with Erbakan , charging him with overseeing the creeping Islamisation of life in the officially secular republic . Officials at the prime minister ' s office had no comment on the prospects for a meeting and a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said it was too early to say if the pair would meet . It has been announced Levy will see President Suleyman Demirel , Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and other ministers from her secularist wing of the coalition . He later travels to Istanbul to meet Jewish leaders . On February 28 , army commanders ordered Erbakan to crackdown on Islamist activism - - his core constituents . He reluctantly agreed but there has been no sign of anti - Islamist measures . Erbakan won a slim plurality in general polls in 1995 after a campaign that included promises to renounce a training pact , signed by the army ' s number two with Israel . He became prime minister , in coalition with conservatives , in June of 1996 . Under the military deal Israeli jets train over the Anatolian heartland , minutes from Israel ' s long - time rival Syria . Israel is also upgrading Turkey ' s ageing F - 4 jets . The military accords angered Iran , most of the Arab world and some Islamists in Turkey but the deals remain in effect despite Welfare ' s public opposition .

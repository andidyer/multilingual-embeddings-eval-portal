Indiana tightens livestock entry requirements . Indiana animal health authorities announced Wednesday new health inspection requirements effective immediately for livestock entering the state to prevent the spread of a highly contagious but non - fatal virus . The virus is vesicular stomatitis ( VS ) and has been detected in six horses in Arizona and New Mexico , according to a statement from the Indiana Board of Animal Health . All livestock entering the state must be inspected by a veterinarian for VS within 30 days prior to entry and the animals must be free of exposure to the disease or a VS - positive premises within 30 days prior to entering Indiana . " VS is a very painful viral disease that can infect a number of domestic and wild animal species , including horses , cattle and swine , " Bret Marsh , Indiana state veterinarian said in the statement . The virus can be spread by insects , infected food and contact with other animals , and can be transmitted to humans in some cases , Marsh said . First signs of the disease usually appear two to eight days after exposure . " The most common symptoms are excessive salivation , fever , and painful lesions on the mucous membranes of the mouth , tongue , soles of the feet and other parts of the body that often force an animal off feed , " Marsh said . The last outbreak of VS was in 1995 , when a handful of cases grew to over 360 in six states , the release said . " Most were horses , although there were quite a few dairy cattle , " said Denise Derrer , state board of animal health information specialist . There were no identified cases in Indiana , she said . " One of the big concerns with horses is that there are a lot of people in Indiana who travel out west for trail rides , elk hunts , horse shows and the horses can come in contact with infected animals , " Derrer said .

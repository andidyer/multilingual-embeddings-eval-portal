SOCCER - DO - OR - DIE TIME FOR UNITED AND AJAX . Manchester United and Ajax Amsterdam play away on Wednesday in Champions ' League matches which will either propel them into the European Cup quarter - finals or wreck their respective seasons . United travel to Rapid Vienna with their fate largely out of their own hands . They require at least a draw , and will need a victory if Turkey ' s Fenerbahce steal a result against European champions Juventus in Turin on the same night . Ajax , bidding for a third consecutive European Cup final appearance , are at least in control of their own destiny . If they win on Wednesday they qualify for the last eight . But the same is true of their opponents Grasshopper Zurich and the four times European champions can expect a torrid ride in Switzerland . By contrast , United will be banking on a half - hearted approach from Rapid , whose hopes of a place in the second phase of Europe ' s leading club competition have long since disappeared . Rapid coach Ernst Dokupil scrapped the team ' s usual training session on Sunday and did not bother to send a spy to watch United beat Leicester 3 - 1 in the premier league on Saturday . Instead , the Rapid players , two weeks into the Austrian league ' s winter break , have been amusing themselves recording and promoting a Christmas single . Austria ' s top scorer Rene Wagner is struggling to overcome a bout of influenza before Wednesday . If he fails to recover , his place will go to Christian Stumpf , who scored in Rapid ' s first Champions ' League clash in September . Suspended Polish defender Andrzej Lesiak is their only certain absentee . United welcome back England international Gary Pallister , who has suffered from a recurring back injury , at the heart of a defence which leaked goals during his absence . " I feel fine now , and it is good to get back in the side and start playing again . " the big defender said . " It will be a different game in Vienna than the one against Leicester . I think it will be very open which should suit us . " We have players like Ryan Giggs , Karel Poborsky and Roy Keane who can run at defenders , and the win against Leicester has put us in good heart . " While United head east at full strength , Ajax are still beset by injuries , although influential defender Frank de Boer looks set to return sooner than forecast after recovering from an ankle injury . Captain Danny Blind has also been back in training after a long lay - off but still seems likely to miss out on the group A match in Zurich . " It ' s very tempting to take Blind with us , " coach Louis van Gaal said on Sunday . " He looks very fit . But he ' s not kicked a ball for around two months so a recall seems improbable . " Grasshopper are without key striker Kubilay Turkyilmaz and fellow - Swiss international Brent Haas , both suspended after collecting second yellow cards in their defeat at Glasgow Rangers a fortnight ago . But the Swiss league ' s leading scorer Viorel Moldovan of Romania returns to the side who beat Ajax 1 - 0 in Amsterdam earlier in the tournament . Bad weather put paid to Grasshopper ' s weekend league fixture and bitter cold and possible snow are forecast for Zurich on Wednesday . That will not suit Ajax , who now play their winter home matches under the sliding roof of their dazzling Arena stadium . The other European giants still waiting on a quarter - final place are AC Milan , back under the guidance of Arrigo Sacchi , who resigned as Italy ' s coach on Sunday to return to the club where he made his name between 1987 and 1991 . They need a point from a delicate home tie against Norway ' s Rosenborg to ensure an all - Italian quarter - final against group C winners Juventus . Liberian striker George Weah is suspended after headbutting Porto ' s Jorge Costa at the end of Milan ' s last European match . French midfielder Marcel Desailly and right side midfielder Stefano Eranio are also out with two yellow cards apiece . Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids is ruled out through a hand injury while right back Christian Panucci is doubtful because of a muscular problem . By way of compensation , Sacchi can call on Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic , Roberto Baggio and Marco Simone to form an imposing trio in an attack which should prove too strong for the Scandinavian visitors .

NUI ' s Florida division gets rate increase . NUI Corp said its City Gas Co of Florida division Tuesday received preliminary approval from the Florida Public Service Commission to increase its annual base rates by $ 3 . 75 million . The increase reflects , in part , significant operational and systems improvements made by the company since its last base rate increase in 1994 , NUI said . The new rates are expected to go into effect with meter readings beginning December 10 following a mandatory waiting period . City Gas earlier had been granted an interim annual rate increase of $ 2 . 1 million that took effect September 12 . The permanent increase includes that interim adjustment . As part of the approval , City Gas Co ' s rate base will increase by 11 percent to $ 91 . 9 million , reflecting the addition of investments in system improvements and expansion projects . Under the approval , City Gas ' allowed return on equity will be 11 . 3 percent and its overall allowed rate of return will be 7 . 87 percent . The $ 3 . 75 million increase in base rates represents an average increase for customers of 5 . 8 percent . The actual increase will vary by rate class , NUI said . City Gas also received permission to segment its commercial class of customers , and to provide more competitive rates to large volume users . In addition , the company said , it was given the ability to set more flexible rates for certain customers with alternate fuel capabilities . - - New York Newsdesk 212 - 859 - 1610 .

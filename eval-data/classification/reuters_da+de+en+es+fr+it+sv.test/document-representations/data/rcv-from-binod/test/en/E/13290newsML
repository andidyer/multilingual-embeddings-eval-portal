Small business starts attracting more people . Nearly 5 million people started up new businesses in the United States last year - - four times as many people than previous estimates revealed , according to a new study . " There are still a lot of people whose idea of the American dream is being your own boss , " said Jim Weidman , spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Businesses , which conducted the study . Research showed the number of businesses started from scratch by one or more people numbered 3 . 5 million last year . Previous estimates of start - ups ranged from as low as 450 , 000 to as high as 1 million , depending on the definition of start - ups . For example , earlier studies counted only new employers , using data such as forms filed when workers were hired or incorporation filings , Weidman said . This study included businesses started from scratch , often home - based , with no employees , but with one or more partners , he said . Using the Gallup organisation , 36 , 000 people were polled directly in phone calls for the data , which was then extrapolated for the general population . " What it tells us is there ' s a lot more creativity than people thought , " said William Dennis , a senior research fellow at the NFIB research centre , who directed the study . " It ' s a picture of a much more dynamic economy , " said Weidman , who said another survey last year showed that 63 percent of 2 , 000 adults polled said they wanted to start their own businesses . " A lot of people out there are willing to take a risk and see if they can make it happen , " he said . Bruce Phillips , director of the Small Business Administration ' s office of economic research , called the new data a " major new contribution . " He said he believed that two - thirds of the start - ups were home - based businesses that need to be researched . " We need to track these business births to understand how our economy grows . " Dennis said that information will be coming soon . His research project , " Business Starts and Stops " is ongoing and will have data in about three months on the home - based start - ups . " We should learn how much money it took and when they started to become profitable , he said .

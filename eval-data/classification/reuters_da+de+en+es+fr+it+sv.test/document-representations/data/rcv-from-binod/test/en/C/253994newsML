Malaysia power producers to set up rural fund . Malaysia ' s independent power producers have agreed to set up a fund for providing electricity to rural areas , a government official said . Deputy Minister for Energy , Telecommunications and Posts Chan Kong Choy told parliament on Wednesday his ministry and the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister ' s Department were working out the contribution rate for IPPs , local newspapers reported on Thursday . " At the meeting between the government and the IPPs recently , their response has been very encouraging and they have agreed to set up a rural electrification fund , " he was quoted as saying by The Star daily . The government has said it wants the country ' s five private power producers to be involved in providing rural electricity , now carried out solely by state power firm Tenaga Nasional Bhd . Government officials have said Tenaga financials are strained as it has to carry out rural electrification works alone , while paying high costs to buy electricity from the power producers .

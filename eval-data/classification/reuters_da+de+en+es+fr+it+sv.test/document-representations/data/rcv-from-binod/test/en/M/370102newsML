Oil prices vulnerable as heating oil demand wanes . World crude oil prices remained vulnerable to losses on Tuesday as waning heating oil demand prompted some European refineries to cut crude runs to rescue profit margins from further erosion . London March futures for benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude advanced 25 cents to $ 21 . 38 a barrel in early trade on Tuesday , but fell back and were struggling to hold above the previous day ' s closing level around mid - afternoon . Traders said the market ' s recent gains could still turn out to be just a short - term correction . Oil analysts said Brent crude oil and gas oil ( heating oil and diesel ) futures looked set for a period of consolidation , helped by support from stronger products as a result of a decision by some refineries to cut runs . They expected prices to head lower after consolidation . " I think the market ( March Brent ) is going to hover around the $ 21 area , " said Darren Gurner , technical analyst at Sucden . " We may well see a corrective bounce but the longer term picture really does look pretty weak " . Some traders saw the market in a sea change as seasonal support from gas oil fades and transport fuels like gasoline and agricultural diesel take up the baton . " Gas oil is the part of the barrel which should carry the best premium now but the crack ( profit margin ) is bad . Gasoline has not taken off yet which it does early in the year as a rule , " said a trader at a northern European refinery . One trader said that when heating oil demand winds down , diesel demand tends to increase from the agricultural sector and helps to put a floor under crude . " This tends to bottom out the market in early February or early March and then rally going into June , " she said . Gas oil ' s profit margin over Brent crude has fallen from $ 6 . 30 a barrel on January 3 to $ 2 . 68 on February 6 . Some European oil refiners have already cut production and others are considering following suit because of poor returns on sales in a weakening late winter heating oil market . Most oil companies declined to comment publicly but traders said they estimated well over 100 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude throughput was being taken out of European volumes throughout February , which is roughly equivalent to five standard North Sea cargoes of crude . Brent fell more than $ 1 . 50 last week as demand for winter heating oil faded , putting paid to a rally which took crude to a six - year high of $ 25 in mid - October and kept prices high to the middle of January .

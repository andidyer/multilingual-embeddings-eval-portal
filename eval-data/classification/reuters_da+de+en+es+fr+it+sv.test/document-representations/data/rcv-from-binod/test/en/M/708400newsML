At 0200 GMT , the ringgit was quoted at 2 . 5220 / 30 to a dollar against its opening around 2 . 5165 . It closed at 2 . 5240 / 50 in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday . " Dollar / ringgit is firming back and may test the 2 . 5250 resistance again later today , " said a dealer with a large Malaysian bank . " Dollar bids are still out there . " Dealers said they heard a buyer was looking around for a price for $ 100 million . But topside for the dollar was expected to be capped at 2 . 5250 , the level at which Bank Negara Malaysia had aggressively defended the ringgit , they said . The central bank was believed to have sold around $ 100 - 150 million on Thursday . Dollar / ringgit fell to a low of 2 . 5140 / 50 during London trading overnight as offshore players who were long on spot ringgit were forced to cover their positions after a jump in swap rates . Dealers said Bank Negara was also said to be in the swap market amid talk that speculators were building up long ringgit positions on the swaps ahead of a potential squeeze by the central bank . Also , there was concern that the central bank would impose some restriction on the ringgit forwards next week , which would effectively create a two - tier market . Dealers also expect liquidity to tighten as there is some perception that speculators would turn their attention to the ringgit after having achieved some partial gains on the baht . - - Syed Azman ( 603 - 275 6835 )

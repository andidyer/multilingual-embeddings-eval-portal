Canadian official admits he wore Nazi swastika . The lieutenant - governor of the Canadian province of Quebec apologised to its Jewish community on Monday for revelations that he wore a Nazi symbol as a student 54 years ago . In a statement , Jean - Louis Roux , the Canadian government - appointed provincial representative of Britain ' s Queen Elizabeth , admitted that as a 20 - year - old pre - medical student at L ' Universite de Montreal in 1942 he drew a swastika , symbol of Germany ' s Nazi party , on his laboratory coat . Roux , 74 , was confirming comments he made in an interview with the French - language newsmagazine L ' Actualite . Roux also said he participated in an anti - conscription demonstration during World War Two that ended with demonstrators breaking the windows of Montreal shops bearing Jewish - sounding names . Roux said , however , that he did not break shop windows during the protest . In his statement , Roux apologised for any hurt the magazine account of his wartime activities might have caused Montreal ' s Jewish community . " These anecdotes don ' t deserve the attention they are getting , " Roux said . " I sincerely regret that their mention has offended the sensitivity of the Jewish community which I regard with cordiality and the warmest respect , " he said . Roux ' s statement came after Quebec Jewish leaders demanded that he apologise for his alleged wartime involvement in Quebec ' s fascist movement . The revelations made in Roux ' s interview with L ' Actualite sparked a sharp reaction from Quebec nationalist leaders . Gilles Rheaume , an activist who advocates Quebec ' s separation from Canada , said he sent a telegram to the Queen on Sunday demanding that Roux be dismissed as Quebec ' s lieutenant - governor . In Canada ' s parliament , Gilles Duceppe , House leader for the separatist Bloc Quebecois , the biggest federal opposition party , also called for Roux ' s resignation . Canada ' s Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps defended Roux , saying many people do things in their youth that they regret later on . " What we must do is reflect on a long 50 - year career , an illustrious career . Jean - Louis Roux has always fought against fascism , " Copps said in parliament . The federal government ' s appointment of Roux as Quebec lieutenant - governor in September created a stir in the French - speaking province because of his strong anti - separatist sentiments . An acclaimed theatre and film actor , Roux was an outspoken advocate of Canadian unity during the 1995 referendum campaign on Quebec separation . Separatists lost the referendum vote by 1 . 2 percentage points .

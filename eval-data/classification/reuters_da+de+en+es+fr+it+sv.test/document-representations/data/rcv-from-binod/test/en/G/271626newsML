Sarajevo journalists who defended Santa attacked . Two radio journalists were beaten after their independent station aired accusations that Moslem authorities had barred the Bosnian version of Santa Claus from holiday celebrations , radio staff said on Saturday . Elvir Bucalo , manager of Radio ISV , and Armin Pozderac , one of its editors , were attacked by two men in a Sarajevo street on Friday . U . N . police spokesman Alexander Ivanko said Bucalo " was kicked in the head and there appears to be some damage to his eye " . Children from Sarajevo ' s Moslem , Catholic Croat and Orthodox Serb communities have celebrated New Year with " Grandfather Frost " for years . Radio ISV had asked listeners whether they wanted to keep Grandfather Frost as a Sarajevo tradition and whether they believed he was becoming unduly politicised . It broadcast an interview with outgoing Bosnian prime minister Hasan Muratovic who said he had nothing against Grandfather Frost delivering gifts to children for New Year ' s day . Some listeners rang up and insisted Muratovic and other members of the main Moslem SDA party discourage kindergartens from inviting Grandfather Frost . A human rights official , who asked not to be named , said the beating incident was disturbing because Sarajevo tended to promote a more tolerant atmosphere towards independent media than other cities in former Yugoslavia . Ivanko said Santa Claus was " an increasingly politicised issue " in Sarajevo after a war fought along religious lines . The Bosnian capital is now a predominantly Moslem city . He said nationalists were interested in strengthening religous or ethnic identities and excluding symbols that might blur those divisions . " It ' s much easier to tell the differences between people when they do not have something uniting them . And Santa Claus is seen a uniting force rather than a force separating people . " The controversy dates back to a letter written by Bosnia ' s Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic last New Year ' s eve when he said Grandfather Frost was not a Moslem tradition . A spokesman for Izetbegovic said on Saturday the president supported every Bosnian ' s right to religious freedom . " It is not his tradition , his grandmother did not talk to him about Santa Claus when he was a boy , but he certainly has nothing against someone whose grandmother did , " Mirza Hajric told Reuters . " There is no objection to Santa Claus officially or unofficially , " he said .

TENNIS - KUERTEN MAKES STRONG START IN MONTREAL . French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil made an impressive start at the $ 2 . 3 million Canadian Open Tuesday , firing bullets past overmatched American Jonathan Stark to claim a 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory . Playing his first match on hard courts since losing in the third round of The Lipton Championships in March , the sixth - seeded Kuerten broke the 70th - ranked Stark ' s serve in the third game of the match and took command by winning 10 of the next 13 games . Fourth - seeded Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov , playing his first hard - court match since New Year ' s Eve , started slowly but came on strong to beat American Vince Spadea 4 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) . In a first - round match that paired two players who won tournaments last Sunday , France ' s Fabrice Santoro rallied from a 1 - 4 third - set deficit to oust 14th - seeded Jim Courier 7 - 5 4 - 6 6 - 4 . Santoro , ranked 50th , captured a lower - level Challenger event on clay in Newcastle , England , playing two matches on Sunday to do so , while Courier triumphed at the ATP Tour event in Los Angeles . Other seeded players winning second - round matches Tuesday included eighth seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands , a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 6 - 1 winner over South African Neville Godwin , and 11th - seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia , who beat France ' s Olivier Delaitre 6 - 4 6 - 1 . The key to the 20 - year - old Kuerten ' s victory over Stark was an endless stream of great passing shots . Kuerten was so effective that Stark was able to win only eight of 27 points when he went to the net . " I ' m confident right now , " said the lanky Brazilian , whose record since the third week of June was only 1 - 4 . " I ' m feeling too good on the court , hitting my best shots and serving well . " The Kafelnikov - Spadea match was one of drastic momentum swings as the American led 6 - 4 3 - 1 only to see the Russian win the second set and take a 5 - 1 third - set lead . Spadea battled back to 5 - all but Kafelnikov eventually prevailed , winning on his fifth match point . " It ' s very tough playing on hard courts again because the bounce is not as high as clay , " said Kafelnikov , who played 11 of his last 13 events on clay . The other two were on grass . " The ball comes much faster . I only had one day of practice but now I have a day off and I ' ll practice and be a lot better for my next match . " Courier , perhaps worn out after beating 15th - ranked Krajicek , world number three Goran Ivanisevic and number eight Thomas Enqvist to win in Los Angeles , conceded that Santoro , " hung in there and played better at the end . " Courier lost a point when he gestured at the umpire after earlier getting a warning for verbal abuse over a remark the official believed was aimed at him , but that Courier insisted was directed toward himself . The point gave Santoro a 30 - love lead when he trailed 3 - 4 in the final set . Santoro , who flew home to Paris Sunday after winning in England , and rushed around doing errands Monday before flying to Montreal , only practiced for 30 minutes on the hard courts at Jarry Park before his match . " I was tired and not feeling too well physically , " he said , " but I still thought I give it my all . " Maybe Jim knew that I ' d just come from England and the clay courts and didn ' t expect me to fight so hard from the first point to the last . "

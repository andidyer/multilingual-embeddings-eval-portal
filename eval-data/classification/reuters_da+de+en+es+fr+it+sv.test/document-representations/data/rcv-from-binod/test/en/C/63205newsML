Power agencies fail to recoup $ 1 . 8 billion in costs . Three federal power marketing agencies lost $ 83 million in costs last year and might have lost as much as $ 1 . 8 billion over the last several years , the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) said in a report released Thursday . The total taxpayer subsidy to the Southeastern , Southwestern and Western Power Marketing Administrations in the 1995 fiscal year amounted to $ 300 million , including financing costs of the agencies ' $ 5 . 4 billion in accumulated debt , said the GAO , the investigatory arm of Congress . The report said federal laws and guidelines were to blame for the massive taxpayer subsidy , because rules bar the agencies from recouping some of their costs in their rates . " It is important to emphasize that the PMAs are generally following applicable laws and regulations regarding recovery of these power - related costs and financing of capital projects , " GAO director of civil audits , Linda Calbom , said in a statement to the House water and power resources panel , which requested the probe . The three agencies , which market bulk power produced at federal dam projects in 30 states , together had revenues of $ 1 billion in the 1995 fiscal year . Congress created five power agencies between 1937 and 1977 to spread use of electricity especially to rural areas at the lowest possible cost to consumers . Among the costs which the agencies may not recover are pension and post - retirement health benefits , spending on environmental measures at two dams , and spending on construction of units which are not yet operating . " It is clearly time to review these policies and change them , " chairman of the House panel , Rep . John Doolittle , R - Calif . , said in a statement prepared for a hearing on the subsidies . The Energy Department said it would work with Congress to revise policies on cost recovery , especially on $ 436 million in pension benefits , $ 454 million in costs allocated to irrigation projects which were never built , and refinancing of investments . But the department added that some costs outlined by GAO might be recoverable in the future , if units that are not yet running eventually do begin operating .

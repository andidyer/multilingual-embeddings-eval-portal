Dec Euroyen futures end down , await BOJ survey . Key December three - month Euroyen deposit rate futures closed a little down on Tuesday in thin trade , on the eve of the Bank of Japan ' s ( BOJ ) quarterly " tankan " business sentiment survey release . Falls in the U . S Treasuries overnight set the tone of the market at the opening , dealers said . After opening lower , the December moved in a narrow range between 99 . 13 and 99 . 16 throughout the session . Much market attention is now on 11 . 00 a . m Wednesday , when the BOJ is due to unveil the closely - watched economic indicator . There might be position adjustment after the market had risen on speculation that the BOJ ' s survey may be worse than earlier forecasts , said a dealer at a securities firm . Another factor weighing on the market was large - volume selling in the cash Japanese government bond market early in the morning , the dealer added . Dealers also said the March contract is likely to take over the benchmark status of futures contract soon . In the call market , a majority of overnight calls were traded at 0 . 48 percent , the rate which is likely to be the weighted average for the day , traders said . Some dealers said they were expecting the rate to fall on Tuesday , as the rate was under upward pressure from bond settlement on Monday . But the rate stayed at 0 . 48 percent . The demand for overnight funding was strong , as a large sum of funds mature today , before the BOJ ' s " tankan " survey on Wednesday , said a trader at a trust bank . The BOJ ' s money market operation was neutral as usual in this bank reserve reporting period . The central bank injected 200 billion yen into the market , which had a net fund shortfall of 210 billion yen before the operation . In the open market , key three - month certificates of deposit ( CDs ) rate inched down to 0 . 57 percent from offers at 0 . 58 percent on Monday . Volume was 20 billion yen . The fall might be based on the view that interest rates are not going to rise for a while , said a dealer at a city bank . The rate could fall to 0 . 55 percent , if the " tankan " survey turn out worse than economists ' forecasts , dealers also said . About 10 billion yen of two - month CDs were issued also at 0 . 57 percent . One - month CDs were issued at 0 . 51 percent , in volume of 80 billion yen . - - Hideyuki Sano , Tokyo Treasury Desk , ( + 81 - 3 - 3432 - 8586 )

As a consequence of these actions , KeyCorp plans to take a fourth quarter 1996 restructuring charge of $ 100 million . KeyCorp also announced its intention to sell slightly more than 140 KeyCenters in primarily rural areas . KeyCorp further indicated that its Board of Directors authorized a new share buyback program , effective immediately , whereby up to 12 million shares may be repurchased by the end of 1997 . The nationwide bank to be formed in 1997 will give Key two national delivery vehicles . The new bank ' s business lines will emphasize community and corporate banking products and services , and will complement the delivery on a nationwide basis of consumer finance products through KeyBank USA , which will remain as a separate company . The resulting customer delivery system will not only be more closely aligned with customer preferences and Key ' s strategic direction , but will also be significantly more cost efficient . Corporate support functions will be reorganized to become more responsive to the needs of clients and customer - contact personnel . KeyCorp management anticipates that the actions announced today will result in annualized earnings benefits of approximately $ 110 million by the end of 1997 . When added to expense reduction programs outlined earlier this year , Key believes it has taken the major steps necessary to achieve its previously - announced efficiency ratio target of 55 percent by the end of 1997 , with further improvement thereafter . " These are bold steps that will complete the process we launched 18 months ago to transform Key into a nationwide financial services provider , " said Robert W . Gillespie , chairman , president and chief executive officer . " We are delighted with the progress we ' ve made since March 1995 , under our First Choice 2000 plan of focusing on our principal lines of business , significantly enhancing marketing and technology resources , and positioning Key as a national competitor , " said Gillespie . " These actions will accelerate our schedule for completion of these tasks and position Key among the top - performing financial services companies in terms of both productivity and earnings growth . " Key ' s transformation of its multi - state office network is aimed at specializing its KeyCenters around target customer segments and serving its communities , as well as preparing the franchise for full interstate banking in the U . S . in 1997 . The approximately 1 , 000 KeyCenters remaining after the actions announced today will continue to undergo enhancements in terms of staff and product specialization , technology additions , and design changes to fit the lifestyles and needs of the target customer groups they serve . These efforts will be supplemented by continued investment in Key ' s Telebanking Centers and Electronic Commerce units , which have proven to be especially popular among customers . The workforce reduction will be distributed throughout KeyCorp and its regions , and be represented in all job levels . Affected employees will be eligible for other open positions within the company or be offered separation assistance . The major components of the planned fourth quarter charge are expected to be as follows : Branch Consolidation $ 20 million Separation Assistance 52 million Technology Write - offs 28 million TOTAL $ 100 millionThe technology write - offs reflect Key ' s accelerated plans for organizing as a single nationwide bank , versus the current 12 - bank , four region banking group . Several minor systems are utilized exclusively to support a multi - bank organization and would no longer be required . KeyCorp is one of the nation ' s largest financial services companies with assets of about $ 65 billion . Through three principal lines of business - - corporate banking , consumer finance , and community banking - - the Cleveland - based company provides retail and wholesale banking , investment , financing , and money management services to individuals and companies across the U . S . Key companies have a presence in 44 states from Maine to Alaska , including its network of KeyCenters , 1 , 800 ATMs , affiliate offices , and four telebanking centers ( 1 - 800 - KEY2YOU ) that provide financial products and services 24 hours a day , every day of the year .

Blood pressure drugs cut heart failure risk - study . Diuretics commonly used to treat high blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of heart failure among older patients , a study said on Tuesday . Researchers tracked 4 , 376 people age 60 or older who participated in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Programme ( SHEP ) . Participants were randomly given the diuretic chlorthalidone , or a placebo . Fatal or non - fatal heart failure occurred in 55 , or 2 . 3 percent , of the 2 , 365 patients given the diuretic , compared to 105 , or 4 . 4 percent , of the 2 , 371 people taking the placebo , the researchers found . " This analysis from SHEP indicates a marked effect of the diuretic - based stepped - care therapy in preventing development of heart failure in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension , " wrote study author John Kostis of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Brunswick , New Jersey . The study appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association . The actual benefit may be greater than the research showed because a large proportion of the patients receiving the placebo crossed over to more active therapy . Diuretics , or anti - hypertensive drugs , may reduce the risk of heart failure by lowering systolic blood pressure , reducing the thickness of the heart muscle wall and improving the heart ' s ability to relax and cut its workload , the researchers said . Systolic blood pressure is considered high when it rises above 160 while the lower , or diastolic number , is normal . Heart failure afflicts more than 2 million people annually in the United States and results in roughly one million hospitalizations . For those 60 and older , it is the most common reason for hospital admission .

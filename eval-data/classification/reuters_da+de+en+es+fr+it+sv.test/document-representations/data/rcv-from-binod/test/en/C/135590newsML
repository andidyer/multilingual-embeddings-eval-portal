ABB 9 - month orders rise 0 . 6 pct . ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG said orders received in the first nine months of the year had risen to $ 25 , 442 million compared with $ 25 , 295 in the same period last year . In its nine month report , ABB also said the order backlog by the end of September had risen slightly to $ 33 . 9 billion from $ 33 . 5 billion at the end of 1995 . ABB noted that the 1996 results took into account the creation of the transportation venture Adtranz with Daimler - Benz AG last year and this affected comparisons . On a comparable basis , i . e . excluding transportation activities , orders received rose seven percent , ABB said . The increase in orders was led by the booking of several large power generation projects in the first half of the year , increased activity in oil , gas and petrochemical , and growth in emerging markets . The large Bakun hydroelectric project in Malaysia , recently awarded to ABB , is not yet reflected in the group ' s orders . - - Peter Nielsen , Zurich Editorial + 41 1 631 7340

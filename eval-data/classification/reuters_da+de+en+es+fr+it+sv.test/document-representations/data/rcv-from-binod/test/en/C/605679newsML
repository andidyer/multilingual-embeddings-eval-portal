Maine governor signs phone fee cut legislation . Maine Gov . Angus King Thursday signed legislation ordering Maine Public Utilities Commission to cut the price of in - state long distance phone charges . Regulators are authorized to have local phone companies reduce the access fees they charge long distance providers on in - state toll calls to the same level they charge those providers for interstate toll calls by May 30 , 1999 . " This bill is more important to more Maine people than just about any bill we ' ve enacted this session , " King said at a State House signing ceremony . King and other supporters of the measure contend reducing the access fees will lead to lower phone rates by encouraging competition for the in - state market between long distance providers . Maine ' s in - state access rates are amoung the highest in the country and the measure signed Thursday could reduce in - state telephone rates by up to 70 percent in the next two years , King said .

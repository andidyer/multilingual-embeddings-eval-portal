Clinton to seek regulatory ban on " soft money " . Battered for months over his 1996 re - election campaign fund - raising practices , President Clinton will petition the Federal Election Commission to close a loophole that allows limitless political contributions known as " soft money , " the White House said Wednesday . " We ' ve talked about doing this for some time , we have some very specific ideas of action the commission might want to consider , " spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters . A White House official said Clinton would send a letter to the FEC Thursday asking it to ban soft money , arguing that the commission has the power to do so because it created the loophole in the first place . A leading Republican Senator immediately said the proposal was a non - starter because he felt that only Congress could take such action . " The FEC itself knows and has previously recognised it does not have the authority to eliminate soft money . Only Congress has the authority , " Sen . Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told a news conference . McCurry said the White House move would not detract from its support of the McCain - Feingold campaign reform bill , which would also ban soft money contributions to political parties , but would work in tandem with it . Clinton has called for passage of the bill sponsored by Sens . John McCain , an Arizona Republican , and Russell Feingold , a Wisconsin Democrat , by July 4 . " They haven ' t been making much head - way on the Hill so we . . . need to find some other ways to jump - start the reform process , " McCurry said . " The president wants through the petition to get the FEC to start to wrestle with one of the most difficult problems in the campaign financing system - - soft money , " Rahm Emanuel , a senior adviser to the president , told Reuters . Emanuel said the move was " not a substitute for campaign reform legislation but a prod " to get Congress moving on the issue . A regulatory ban on soft money would attack what reform advocates consider one of the prime areas for abuse in the campaign finance system . Under current rules , wealthy donors , corporations and labour unions can get around federal limits on gifts to individual candidates by donating as much money as they want to Republican or Democratic party committees . This money is supposed to be used for " party - building purposes " but often winds up supporting individual campaigns , especially in television advertising campaigns . A rash of reports about campaign finance abuses emerged in the 1996 presidential campaign , prompting Clinton to pledge reform in his State of the Union speech in January . The White House first discussed the FEC move two months ago but held off for fear of derailing the McCain - Feingold bill . McCurry conceded there was little prospect for quick action by the regulatory body .

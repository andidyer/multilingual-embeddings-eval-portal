Activists to discuss disputed China Sea islands . Activists from six countries and territories plan to meet in Macau next week to discuss " protection " of a group of islands in the East China Sea disputed by China , Japan and Taiwan , organisers said on Friday . Organiser Lo Sio said two dozen activists from China , Taiwan , Japan , Hong Kong , Macau and Canada had been invited to attend the three - day meeting on the " protection of the Diaoyu islands " . Lo said eight to 10 Chinese activists were expected to attend the talks in the Portuguese - administered territory but he would not confirm whether Tong Zeng , the mainland ' s most prominent critic in the islands row , would take part . A long - dormant dispute over the islands , known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese , reignited in July when the right - wing Japan Youth Federation erected a makeshift lighthouse on one . The youth federation ' s activities and the presence of Japanese patrol boats near the islands angered Taiwan and China and prompted public protests in Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macau . A Hong Kong activist drowned in September when he jumped off his protest ship into the sea near the islands .

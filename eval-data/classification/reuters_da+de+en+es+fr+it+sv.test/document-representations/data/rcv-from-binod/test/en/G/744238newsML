Indonesian MP sentenced for defaming Suharto . A member of parliament from the minority Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) , Aberson Marle Sihaloho , was sentenced on Monday to nine months in jail for defaming President Suharto . He was believed to be the first sitting member of parliament to have been sentenced to a prison term during Suharto ' s 30 - year rule . He was free pending an appeal . " Aberson has been found guilty of deliberately defaming the president and we sentence him to nine months ' jail , " chief judge Soehardjo told the Central Jakarta State Court . A supporter of former PDI leader Megawati Sukarnoputri , Aberson was accused of defaming Suharto in a speech at PDI headquarters in June last year during rallies to protest over Megawati ' s ousting as party chief . He did not run in the May 29 general elections , but he retains his seat until the new parliament meets on October 1 . Chief defence lawyer Luhut Pangaribuan told reporters : " We do not accept the decision and we will appeal . " Aberson denied the charges , saying the state constitution guaranteed legislators the right to criticise and express opinions different from the president ' s and state institutions . The prosecution had sought an 18 - month sentence for Aberson , who was also found guilty of defaming the armed forces d the House of Representatives . The main charge carried a possible six - year term . The prosecution accused Aberson of telling a crowd of several hundred outside the PDI headquarters : " Throughout the 30 years of Suharto ' s leadership , our fredom has been stolen and we are being colonised once again . " Supporters of Surjadi , the man who replaced Megawati as PDI leader at a government - backed rally in June last year , stormed the party headquarters with police support last July 27 , sparking the worst riots seen in Jakarta for two decades . Megawati was in court for the Monday hearing , and her supporters jeered as the verdict was announced . She made no immediate comment . Riot police provided strong security outside the court , but there was no trouble . Another Indonesian legislator , Sri Bintang Pamungkas , was sentenced last February to a 34 - month jail term for defaming Suharto in a speech to Indonesian students in Germany in April 1995 . He had been expelled from his minority United Democratic Party ( PPP ) in 1995 , however , and as a result had lost his seat in parliament . The PDI , the PPP and the ruling Golkar are the only three parties legally permitted in Indonesia . Sri Bintang was free pending a second appeal , but he subsequently was detained in March on subversion charges which carry a maximum death penalty and still awaits trial .

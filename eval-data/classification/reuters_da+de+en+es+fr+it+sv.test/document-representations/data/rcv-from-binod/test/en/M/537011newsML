WORLD BONDS - Italy top pick in Europe for short end . Italy should remain the top pick for investors looking to profit in the short end of the debt market but incursions into Britain and France should also be rewarding , analysts said on Thursday . Concerns over European monetary union will continue rattle the Italian market , but the prospect of interest rate cuts was too hard to resist . Gilts meanwhile have been too pessimistic about possible rate rises while France looked cheap after its recent hammering . " Italy has a slightly higher risk over the next one month but the in the medium term , the short end still looks pretty good , " James Mitchell , senior fixed income strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London , said . " The discount rate should come down 75 to 100 basis points over the next few months . We ' ve got real rates in Italy of about five percent . The economy is really struggling and inflation is only about 1 . 7 percent . " Preliminary data from Italy this week showed inflation should reach a 28 - year low in April at 1 . 7 percent , well below 2 . 2 percent in March and continuing the downward trajectory of the past year . That should form a solid basis for the Bank of Italy to continue chopping interest rates , overriding concerns Italy will not make it into European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) in the first wave , and those generated by the French election . The Italian discount rate stands at 6 . 75 percent , having been reduced from 7 . 50 percent on January 21 . Mitchell expects the two - year Italy / Germany yield gap to shrink around 25 basis points from 317 now over the next two months . Paul Horne , international economist at Smith Barney in Paris , would also buy Italy . " I am wary of Italy but they ' ve got a flat yield curve so the short end looks good . They really have no choice but to lower rates with the way the inflation rate is going , " he said . Gilts , however , were his top choice as the market overcompensates for expected rate rises and the May 1 election battle heats up . An opinion poll out this week , showed the ruling Conservatives dramatically narrowing the gap to the Labour Party . " Watch the gap in London , the gap is disappearing . Since the UK pays more than anybody except Italy and Greece , one way or the other sterling looks pretty good , " he said . He added , " We all know short rates are going up . The two - to - three - year range prices in the rate rise we can expect , " he said . Two - year gilts were quoted with a yield of 6 . 93 percent at 1105 GMT while three - years were yielding 7 . 18 percent . The UK base rate is at 6 . 00 percent . Mitchell said France also looked attractive after the short - end of the market slid earlier in the week when France called a snap election for May 25 - June 1 . Any indication France would let up in its determination to pare spending and balance it books to meet the EMU criteria would hit the market hard . The two - year French / German yield gap has swung out to around 20 basis points from four basis points before the election was called . " Things could get worse before they get better but with the sell - off we ' ve had in recent days and the early election . . . ( they ' re ) attractive against Germany , Holland and the core markets , " he said . " Longer term , we don ' t expect any fundamental change in monetary policy . " Jan Loeys , global fixed income strategist at JP Morgan in London , recommends investors keep overall portfolio duration short of the five - year area in Europe for three reasons . " First , growth is stronger than the consensus perceives which tells us the curves will gradually move up . The two - to - five curve will probably steepen because the two year is linked to the perception the Bundesbank will stay on hold while the long end goes with the rest of the market , " he said . Secondly , core European markets were historically expensive . " If I draw in all the economic fundamentals of deficit , growth , inflation and the like , they suggest that Bunds should be 40 basis points higher , " he said . The third reason was that domestic investors , were still long the European markets while international investors have begun to switch out , anticipating weakness ahead . - - International Bonds Unit + 44 171 542 6176

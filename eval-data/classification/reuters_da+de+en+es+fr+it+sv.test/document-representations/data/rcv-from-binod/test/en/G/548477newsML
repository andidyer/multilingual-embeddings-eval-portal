German journalist says under house arrest in China . The Beijing correspondent of Germany ' s Der Spiegel news magazine said on Tuesday he had been put under house arrest in a hotel with the brother of dissident Wei Jingsheng in Wei ' s home town in eastern China . Speaking by telephone from his hotel in the town of Caohu in Anhui province , Juergen Kremb told Berlin ' s InfoRadio he and Wei ' s brother had not been formally arrested but could only move freely inside the hotel . " The windows in my room have been sealed and a policeman sits outside in the lobby . As soon as I leave the hotel someone tries to stop me or someone accompanies me through the streets , " Kremb told the radio station . Normally a journalist who travels outside Beijing must obtain a permit from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to be allocated an official guide , but Kremb said he and Wei ' s brother had paid a " private " visit to Caohu at the weekend . The Chinese authorities accused him of carrying out illegal interviews and organising meetings there - - charges he rejected as absurd . Kremb also said he was under pressure to make a confession and hand over his research materials . He planned to fly back to Beijing from Caohu during the day but was not sure he would be allowed to . " My flight ticket was confiscated , my papers were confiscated , the peasants in the village were interrogated and Wei ' s brother - - who is a very unpolitical person , and no way a dissident - - is also being detained , " Kremb protested . InfoRadio reported that the German embassy in Beijing had been in contact with Kremb . Wei , regarded as the father of China ' s tiny democracy movement , has spent most of the last 20 years in prison for his outspoken comments on human rights and politics . He was given a 14 - year jail term in 1995 for financing the democracy movement . The authorities say he is a common criminal . Beijing declined in December 1995 to renew a visa and work permit for German Henrik Bork , the correspondent for the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper , but denied it was expelling him from China . China last expelled a foreign reporter in September 1991 , when it ejected Andrew Higgins of London ' s Independent newspaper . A correspondent for Germany ' s Der Spiegel , Terzano Tiziani , was forced out in March 1984 .

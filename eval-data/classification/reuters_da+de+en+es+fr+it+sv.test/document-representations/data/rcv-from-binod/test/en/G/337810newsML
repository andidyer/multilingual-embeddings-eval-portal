Canada to send envoy to U . S . to discuss Cuba . Canada will send an envoy to Washington to discuss a visit to Cuba last week by Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy that has been a bone of contention between the two neighbours , the State Department said on Tuesday . Spokesman Nicholas Burns said the trip was agreed during a long telephone conversation about Cuba on Monday between Axworthy and new U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright . " He said that he ' d be sending down to Washington one of his experts who was with him ( in Cuba ) to give a very detailed briefing on the Canadian view of the situation in Havana , " Burns told reporters . The United States , which has been trying for more than 30 years to isolate Cuba , last week issued thinly veiled criticisms of Axworthy ' s trip , saying such visits rewarded Cuba ' s communist leadership . Republican Sen . Jesse Helms compared the Canadian minister ' s visit to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain ' s appeasement of Adolf Hitler in 1938 . In Cuba , Axworthy met President Fidel Castro and the two agreed to work to advance their dialogue on a range of issues , including economic cooperation and human rights . Washington and Ottawa are deeply divided over last year ' s Helms - Burton law that penalises foreign companies that use property in Cuba confiscated from U . S . citizens . Helms - Burton was a leading topic in a meeting on Tuesday between Albright and a European Union team led by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo and Sir Leon Brittan , vice - president of the European Commission . Like Canada , the EU is strongly opposed to the law . " We are working on that . We have not got there . Our concerns remain . I hope our concerns can be met , and we are ready to take action in a new and vigorous way working with you to resolve that , " Brittan told Albright . Burns said that as well as Axworthy , Albright had made introductory calls on Tuesday to the foreign ministers of Croatia , Ukraine , Chile , Brazil and Israel , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Organisation of African Unity Secretary - General Salim Salim . Albright took office last Thursday .

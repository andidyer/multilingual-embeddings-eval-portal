San Miguel sees growth opportunities with CC - Amatil . Food and beverage conglomerate San Miguel Corp said on Thursday the merger of its Coke bottling unit with Coca - Cola Amatil Ltd ( CCA ) will provide it with global growth opportunities . In a press briefing , Francisco Eizmendi , the conglomerate ' s president and chief operating officer , said , " We have the potential to be offered other franchises ( of Coke ) as they become available . " He cited India as a possible new market . " Coke recently re - entered India and may be looking for partners . We foresee at some point they will be able to offer the franchise , " Eizmendi said . Coke left India in 1977 following a dispute with the government , and re - entered in the early 1990s when the country launched an economic liberalisation programme . Under the terms of agreement with CCA , San Miguel will give up its 70 percent control in Coca - Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc ( CCBPI ) which will be fully - owned by the Australian - based Coca - Cola Amatil in a deal valued at about $ 2 . 7 billion . The integration makes CCA the largest Coca - Cola anchor bottler outside the United States . The combined sales revenue of CCA and CCBPI in 1996 amounted to $ 3 . 7 billion and operating income of $ 438 million , San Miguel said . San Miguel will be the second largest shareholder of CCA with a stake of 25 percent . The Coca - Cola Company , which owns 30 percent of CCBPI , will remain CCA ' s largest shareholder at 33 percent . Though San Miguel will be giving up control in CCBPI , it will have a larger market share as a result of the merger . " In one dynamic step , we shall have expanded the horizon of pur soft - drink business from the domestic market servicing 68 million consumers to an international arena spanning three continents with a consumer base of 448 million , " Eizmendi said . CCBPI has 75 percent of the softrinks market in the Philippines and contributed to 39 percent of San Miguel ' s net income in 1996 . The firm posted 6 . 09 billion pesos in net income last year , including one - time gains . Moreover , Eizmendi said the merger would provide economies of scale and enhance San Miguel ' s stock in the market . " Since CCA is a listed company , the transaction will allow analysts to put a public market value on San Miguel ' s soft drink investment , " he said . " As you know , Coca - Cola anchor bottlers tend to trade at price - earnings multiples higher than food and beverage companies , " he said . Delfin Gonzalez , San Miguel ' s chief finance officer , said the transaction will " result in a small amount ( of net income ) this year and growing in the next few years . ' But he declined to offer specifics . He said the transaction will not result in a capital gain for San Miguel because it would just involve the swapping of shares . - Manila newsroom 63 2 841 - 8937 fax 8176267

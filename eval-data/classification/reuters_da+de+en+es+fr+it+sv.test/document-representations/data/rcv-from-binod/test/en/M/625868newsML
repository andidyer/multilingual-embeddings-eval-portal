CZECH CROWN HOLDS GAINS BUT MORE PRESSURE SEEN . The embattled Czech crown held on to recent gains on Friday , but analysts warned the market remains volatile with expectations of an imminent easing of interest rates that could trigger another attack on the currency . The crown , under heavy selling pressure over the last two weeks , fell some two percentage points at midday after rumours of a possible resignation of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , but re - gained all of its losses when the PM vowed to fight on . Analysts , however , said that the central bank ' s high interest rate policy must end soon and that this might prompt investors to go on the offensive and once again push the crown lower . " It ( Klaus ' s announcement ) surprised the market here , the crown and bonds will get somewhat stronger , " said Matt Starr , director of capital markets at Creditanstalt in Prague . " But still the view is very negative . I think the lift on the markets will be short term , people are still pessimistic , there ' s still a lot more sellers than buyers of Czech assets , " he added . The crown firmed against the mark to stand at 19 . 069 to the mark and 32 . 384 to the dollar at 1300 GMT , level with morning levels . Two weeks ago , the central bank ( CNB ) moved to shore up the crown by raising its Lombard rate to 50 percent from 14 percent , and its repo rate to 75 percent from 12 . 9 percent , while cutting off non - residents ' s access to crowns . On Monday , continued selling pressure on the crown forced the CNB to abolish the bands within which the crown moves against a basket of marks and dollars ( 65 pct marks / 35 pct dollars ) , calling the new system a " controlled float " . It also raised its discount rate to 13 percent from 10 . 5 . The currency immediately weakened some eight percent before recouping some of this in an illiquid market . " I expect sometime later today ( Friday ) or most probably early next week an easing of monetary policy , " said Petr Kukla of Girocredit Bank . Dealers said the squeeze on liquidity , which has pulled the crown back from lows of around 20 to the mark , is unsustainable and harmful to the wider economy . Said one London - based trader : " Everyone is watching the central bank and waiting . Once they lower rates , and they have to before the costs become too high , then the recent demand for crowns will evaporate and we should see a renewed attack . " Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , in a dramatic acknowledgement of the Czech economy ' s problems , also announced on Wednesday sweeping cabinet changes and a six - point recovery plan , including spending cuts and a public sector wage freeze . The moves followed two turbulent weeks for the currency as investors , alarmed at yawning trade and current account deficits as well as political uncertainty , dumped the crown . The government package is intended to restore balance to the economy and stabilise the currency . The cuts will need the approval of parliament where the ruling three - party coalition has the slenderest majority . Dealers said the crown could fall to 20 - 21 to the mark before coming back to around current levels . " The reaction of the crown will depend a lot on whether they keep restrictions on non - residents ' access to funds . If the limits are removed , I expect the crown will go lower , the question is where it will find a new level , " said Breta Tichanek of ING bank in Prague . - - Prague Newsroom , 420 - 2 - 2423 - 0003

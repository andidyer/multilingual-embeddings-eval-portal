Chinese police face dismissal amid bad behaviour . China unveiled two new regulations that make it easier from Friday to sack police as part of a bid to improve the quality of officers following reports of bad behaviour , state media said on Friday . " Some people of poor quality and not suitable for public security work have been admitted , and they have seriously affected the image of public security departments and people ' s police , " the Xinhua news agency quoted Ministry of Personnel official Zhu Chunlin as saying . The two regulations , issued jointly by the Ministry of Public Security and the Personnel Ministry , were aimed at raising the overall quality of the police force , Zhu said . Without the rules " people unsuitable or unqualified to be a police cannot be removed quickly " , he said . The regulation on police enrollment includes qualifications for applying to be an officer as well as approval procedures . The rules on police dismissal stipulate procedures to sack officers as well as unemployment insurance for those who are fired and the rights of those dismissed to file appeals . Zhu gave no details of the misdemeanours of police , but the official media frequently carries reports of abuse of power by police , of the use of torture to extract confessions and the use of power to settle personal vendettas .

Tribunal , NATO may go after Croat suspects - paper . The United Nations war crimes tribunal may request a NATO raid on indicted Bosnian Croats similar to a swoop last week on Serb suspects , a Croatian weekly reported on Wednesday . The independent Globus magazine also said the tribunal may charge several suspects in Croatia proper under sealed , or secret , indictments for crimes committed during Croatia ' s war with minority Serbs . The tribunal , set up by the United Nations in 1993 to prosecute atrocities committed during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia , declined any comment on the Globus article . Tribunal investigators last month arrested a Croatian Serb who did not know he had been indicted when he entered a U . N . - patrolled area of Croatia . The Serb suspect was extradited to The Hague to face trial on charges listed in a sealed indictment , a new tool employed by the tribunal . British special forces last week pounced on two Bosnian Serb suspects also charged under sealed indictments . One suspect was arrested and the other shot dead in a gun battle after he fired on a British soldier . The arrests were made in line with the tribunal ' s new strategy - - keeping fresh indictments secret to enable arrests of suspects who might otherwise go into hiding . Globus said NATO may soon launch similar arrest operations against 11 Croats in central Bosnia , who recently said in a letter they were ready to appear before the tribunal but wanted guarantees that they would receive a fair trial . Tribunal officials were angered that Dario Kordic and Ivica Rajic , the two most prominent Croat suspects , charged with crimes against humanity , did not sign the letter , Globus said . Western mediators say the presence of indicted war criminals is one of the main obstacles to building a lasting peace in Bosnia . Croatian President Franjo Tudjman told Reuters in an interview last month that Croatia would arrest and hand over any indicted persons entering its territory . However , virtually all indicted Croats are believed to be living in Bosnia . Quoting sources close to the tribunal , Globus said there were at least nine sealed indictments . It said they may include two Bosnian Croat warlords arrested by Croatian police in April , as well as some Bosnian Serb and Moslem suspects . Globus said the tribunal was preparing the first sealed indictments against Croats from Croatia . It said one of the possible indictees was Tomislav Mercep , who commanded special police forces at the outset of the 1991 war with the Serbs . His troops are alleged to have been involved in mass killings of Serbs . " I ' ve seen a lot of documents about Mercep ' s activities , mostly Serb , though , and it was sent to The Hague . Most of it looks pretty good so I would not exclude it , " a United Nations . official , who asked not to be named , said . He added documentation on Mercep was quite specific and included dates and places of alleged crimes . The NATO - led peace force would not and could not " discuss future operations " , spokesman Major John Blakeley said in Sarajevo . " But our mandate has not changed . If we come across war crimes suspects we will arrest them , if the situation permits , " he said .

Czech PX50 declines despite SPT Telecom gains . The Czech PX50 fell back on Thursday despite solid gains for SPT Telecom , the most heavily capitalised share on the index . Activity was similar to Wednesday ' s at around 760 million crowns and SPT continued to attract most of the buying interest from foreign and domestic investors . " Recently , I ' ve read a series of surveys from recognised brokerage firms . . . and everyone says that people should be overweight on Telecom , " said Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securities . Power utility CEZ closed up three crowns but was off earlier highs . Late in the continuous session , CEZ ' s annual general meeting voted to pay no dividend on 1996 profits . CEZ had planned to pay its first ever dividend on 1996 profits but the Industry and Trade Ministry objected arguing that the money should be spent on investment and that it would be politically embarassing to pay out dividends at a time when prices to households are being raised . Most of the downward pressure on the PX50 came from Komercni Banka which , dealers said , continued to be hit by high interest rates .

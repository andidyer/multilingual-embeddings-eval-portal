Sales into German grain intervention stores may reach up to three million tonnes in the Nov - May 1996 / 97 season , Klaus Heitmann , general secretary of the central business association of 16 leading ports , ZDS , said . Only some 1 . 7 million tonnes were taken into intervention in 95 / 96 when world market prices were high . Grain prices are now falling under supply pressure so some volumes from this year ' s record 42 million tonne crop are expected to end up in intervention . " But for the time being , intervention is very sluggish , " Heitmann said . ZDS members were still demanding more intervention grain was stored in port silos , ready for export , rather than in inland warehouses , Heitmann also said . But discussions with the intervention authorities had revealed legal hurdles to such steps . ZDS silos could offer capacity of up to one million tonnes .

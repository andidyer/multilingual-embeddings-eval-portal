Poll shows most Colombians oppose extradition . Most Colombians oppose lifting their country ' s constitutional ban on extradition - - cited in June as justification for not sending drug lords for trial in the United States - - a nationwide poll showed on Monday . The survey , conducted by the respected RCN radio news network , showed only 30 percent of Colombians approved of their fellow countrymen being tried in foreign lands . Of 3 , 236 people interviewed on Monday , 1 , 982 or 61 . 2 percent said they opposed extradition , according to RCN . Only 970 , or 30 percent , said they supported the practice , the radio said . No margin for error was given . But 284 people , or 8 . 8 percent of the total , either declined to respond or said they had no opinion . Colombia denied a request in June from U . S . Attorney General Janet Reno for the extradition of four top drug lords , including brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela - - the billionaire chieftains of the Cali drug cartel . In doing so , the government cited the constitutional ban that Colombia ' s Congress placed on extradition in 1991 . But Washington signalled its anger shortly afterwards by stripping President Ernesto Samper of his U . S . travel visa . Apart from nationalistic pride , political analysts say grassroots opposition to extradition is largely due to the campaign of bombings , assassinations and kidnappings that drug lords waged against the practice in the 1980s and early 1990s .

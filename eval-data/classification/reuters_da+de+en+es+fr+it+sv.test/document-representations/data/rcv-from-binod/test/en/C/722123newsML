Colombia ' s Ocensa agrees $ 670 mln in new loans . Colombia ' s Ocensa pipeline consortium , comprised of state - run oil company Ecopetrol and five multinational corporations , signed a deal Friday for syndicated loans worth $ 670 million , a spokesman said . The two loans , worth $ 566 million and $ 104 million , have been agreed with a group of 31 banks led by Chase Manhattan and will be used to refinance exisiting debt and for the future development of the pipeline , the Ocensa spokesman said . The Ocensa consortium is made up of Ecopetrol , British Petroleum Co Plc , Total Pipeline Colombie , Triton Pipeline Colombia and Canadian companies TCPL Bermuda and IPL Enterprises . The final weld was completed on the pipeline late last month , although upgraded pumping stations on the 500 - mile ( 800 km ) pipeline will only be ready toward the end of the year . BP officials said in a recent Reuters interview that the Ocensa pipeline will be pumping about 450 , 000 barrels per day from the end of this month or early August - - 320 , 000 barrels of that from the BP - operated Cusiana - Cupiagua field in eastern Colombia . At that stage , Ocensa will overtake the slightly shorter Cao Limn - Covenas pipeline , which serves Occidental Petroleum Corp ' s field in eastern Arauca province , as Colombia ' s largest pipeline .

CME lumber futures pare limit gain at close . CME lumber futures eased from best levels by the close with March slipping from an earlier limit advance on renewed commercial pressure , traders said . Futures closed $ 8 . 10 to $ 2 . 50 per thousand board feet higher paced by March at $ 411 . 70 per tbf . That month had posted a limit gain of $ 10 . 00 and limitless January was up as much as $ 11 . 50 before slipping to close $ 4 . 50 higher at $ 405 . 00 per tbf . Short covering by cash - connected commission houses and locals drove prices up sharply before the renewed scattered commercial selling interest late . The market appeared oversold after falling from $ 433 to under $ 400 recently , traders said . But weak cash lumber prices continued to weigh on the market . January , due to expire Wednesday , showed the largest setback from its high with March following by the close . Cash spruce may be quoted lower Wednesday following reduced mill asking prices earlier in the week . High lumber prices and poor weather for building has kept demand slack , sources added . " Prices are still too high to accumulate spring inventory , " said Curt Cunningham , President of Pacific Futures Trading . ( ( Jerry Bieszk 312 - 408 - 8725 ) )

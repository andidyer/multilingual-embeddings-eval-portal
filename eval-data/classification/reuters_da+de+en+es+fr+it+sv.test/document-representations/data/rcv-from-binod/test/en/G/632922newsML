SOCCER - DORTMUND SHOCKED AS PRESIDENT QUITS . Borussia Dortmund president Gerd Niebaum stunned the European Cup winners on Tuesday by announcing he planned to step down . Niebaum , 48 , whose trophy - laden 11 - year tenure has left him with hero status in this Ruhr Valley town , said he would not be seeking re - election at the club ' s annual meeting this autumn . Niebaum , in charge of a large law office in Dortmund , put the move down to the growing quantity of work associated with the president ' s position . " I ' ve put in between eight and 10 hours a day for the club , gladly and passionately , but with the growing burdens of the role I do not want to sacrifice my family and professional life for a further three years , " he said . Dortmund players , including current European Player of the Year Matthias Sammer , were clearly dismayed by the news . " Niebaum was one of the reasons I came to Borussia in the first place , " said Sammer , a key figure in Dortmund ' s 3 - 1 European Cup victory last week . Niebaum said winning Europe ' s top competition was critical to the timing of his announcement . " I wouldn ' t have arrived at this decision had we not won the final last Wednesday . But I ' m leaving the house in order , " he said . Niebaum , who said he would help the club find his replacement , presided over Dortmund ' s 1989 German Cup final victory and two German championship wins in 1995 and 1996 . Previously , he was part of the board management team who between 1984 and 1986 saved the club from mounting debts and possible bankruptcy .

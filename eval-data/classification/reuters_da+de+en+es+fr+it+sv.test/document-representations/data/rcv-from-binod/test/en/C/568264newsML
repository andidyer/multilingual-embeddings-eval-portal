Cisco cautious on Q4 growth , stock seen weak . Cisco Systems Inc matched Wall Street ' s diminished expectations for its April quarter , but analysts warned the stock could trade lower on Wednesday after cautious comments made by Cisco executives . " I think the stock is going to trade down tomorrow , " said an analyst who asked not to be named . The company late on Tuesday reported earnings for the third fiscal quarter ended in April of $ 0 . 52 per share - - matching the consensus analyst estimate for the quarter according to First Call . The company reported earnings of $ 0 . 37 per share in the comparable period of 1996 . Cisco shares slipped to 56 in after - hours trading on Tuesday from an earlier close of 57 - 3 / 4 , before the release of the April earnings report and the conference call with analysts . " April basically made the quarter for them , " A . G . Edwards analyst Peter Andrew said after listening to the conference call . " The big question is whether this is a trend that will continue into the current quarter . " During a conference call , John Chambers , Cisco ' s president and chief executive , spoke with a mixture of cautious optimism and what he called " normal paranoia . " " Though this quarter was more back - end loaded than we would have liked , April was very solid in terms of bookings and linearity , " he said , comparing April to February and March , which Cisco had warned earlier in the spring had showed signs of sluggishness . " While we are cautiously optimistic , we need to see how the next few months go before we can determine if what occurred in April is a trend . " Referring to the current quarter ended in July , Chambers said : " Q4 has historically been a good quarter for Cisco , however in the past high backlogs and longer lead times provided a buffer between the variable order growth and reasonable , steady revenue growth . " But he warned that Cisco was seeing ever shorter order lead times . " Even in good quarters , we won ' t know until the last couple of weeks of the quarter whether we will close at , above or below expectations , " Chambers said . When asked if April ' s growth rate and seasonal strength typically seen in the current quarter could produce double - digit growth over the April quarter , Chambers said : " I would think that would be a little too optimistic . " " We tend to be very conservative on the financial positioning , " he went on . " We would look for single - digit this quarter in terms of the growth projections , " adding that Cisco was planning its expenses accordingly . Days Sales Outstanding ( DSOs ) , a carefully watched measure of the time it takes to collect accounts receivable increased to 63 days from 59 days , Chief Financial Officer Larry Carter said during the call . " The rise was primarily due to non - linearity of shipments in the quarter , " Carter said , referring to the April uptick in bookings . But if current conditions hold up , Cisco expects DSOs to improve in the July quarter , he said . " Geographically , growth remained solid except where there is lower capital spending overall and therefore reduced network spending , " he said of industry growth overall , adding : " We see this in such areas as Japan , Germany and France . " While Japan and Germany may be bottoming out , Chambers said , " France continues to see very , very sluggish and we saw a little bit of sluggishness in Korea as well . " He said Cisco ' s telephone carrier sales business was soft , worldwide , even though its Stratacom unit ' s April quarter revenues were 30 percent above any previous quarter . A . G . Edward ' s analyst Andrew said that although Cisco posted year - over - year revenue growth in the April quarter of 52 percent , revenues grew a tepid three percent from the January 1997 quarter . " It was the first quarter in recent memory that they grew in the single - digits , " Andrew said . Seeking to play down weak sequential quarterly growth , Chambers said on the call : " Analysts believe and we agree that underlying industry drivers ( of growth ) have not changed . " " The growth projections from industry sources continue to estimate industry growth between 30 to 50 percent , subject to fluctuations from quarter to quarter , " he said . Cisco ' s growth of more than 50 percent year - on - year beat the aggregate growth of Cisco ' s top eight competitors , which had a combined rate of 30 percent in the most recent quarter , Chambers noted . " Gross margins of 55 . 3 percent - flat from last quarter - was a good achievement , " Chambers said . Cisco had previously voiced concern that its historically high profit margins could decline during the quarter . Echoing their previous long - term guidance , Cisco officials repeated that the company ' s gross margins were expected to continue to decline , despite periodic quarters where improvement or no change occurs . Chambers said Cisco ' s goal over the next 12 to 24 months was to grow at or above industry growth rates of 30 to 50 percent , but he cautioned that Cisco ' s size makes growing faster than the industry increasingly difficult to sustain . He said Cisco ' s partnerships with industry heavyweights such as already announced relationships with Microsoft Corp , Intel Corp , Hewlett - Packard and GTE Corp will play a more prominent strategic role than acquisitions in the future . " We believe strategic partnerships will be as important in the next three years as acquisitions were in the last three years , " the executive said . This wlll allow Cisco to offer more complete end - to - end systems that reduce the difficulties of managing large , far - flung networks . " We believe that acquisitions will continue going forward , " Chambers added . " We will probably acquire eight to 12 companies this year , for example , " he said .

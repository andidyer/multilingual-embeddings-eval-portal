Piltel sees 1997 net at 1 . 4 bln pesos . Cellular phone firm Pilipino Telephone Corp is eyeing a 1 . 4 billion peso net income in 1997 , 40 percent higher than the 1996 projected profits of one billion pesos , a top company official said on Tuesday . The official , who requested not to be named , said the company expects a 30 percent increase in revenues for next year with turnover at six billion pesos . Piltel downgraded its 1996 net income forecast of 1 . 16 billion pesos for 1996 on Monday due to illegal calls expected to result in a 300 million peso revenue loss by the end of the year . In a separate interview , Piltel president Ramon Cojuangco told Reuters he expected the firm ' s earnings to improve next year as the company would have completed installation of anti - cloning measures . Several cellular phone companies in the Philippines have recently become victims of fraud as some people managed to clone or copy subscribers identification numbers and use lines to make illegal calls . Cojuangco said the company was supporting the passage of an anti - cloning bill that will slap stiffer penalties on telephone frauds . Piltel chief financial officer Ignatious Yenko said that by year - end the company would have installed a $ 10 million anti - fraud software and hardware that will prevent cloning . " We expect revenue loss by next year to drop to a range of one million to five million pesos a month , " Yenko said . He added that the subscriber base of the cellular phone firm is projected to increase from 363 , 715 as of September to 400 , 000 - 420 , 000 by yearend . Next year , another 200 , 000 to 250 , 000 may be added to the subscriber base , he said . - Katherine Espina 63 2 8418939 fax 8176267

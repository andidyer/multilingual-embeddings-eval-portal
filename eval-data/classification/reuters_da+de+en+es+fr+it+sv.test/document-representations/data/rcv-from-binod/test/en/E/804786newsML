Fed expected to leave U . S . rates untouched . U . S . Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to leave interest rates alone when they meet on Tuesday amid mounting evidence of solid economic growth coupled with low inflation . And with financial markets already on edge , attempts to cool off the economy by raising the cost of money may not only be unwarranted but outright dangerous , analysts said . The U . S . economy is revelling in its seventh year of unchecked expansion - - the third - longest growth period since the end of the Second World War . Prices are at bay and observers detect few stormclouds on the horizon . " The odds heavily favor that the Fed will keep policy unchanged , " said David Jones of New York - based brokerage Aubrey G . Lanston & Co . Despite broadly positive fundamentals , a growing number of investors appears to worry about future returns . On Friday , the Dow Jones industrial average registered its second biggest point loss in history , shedding more than 247 points to close at 7 , 694 . 66 , hurt by a weakening dollar and concerns that corporate profits may not be able to keep up their solid pace . " If the Fed were to raise rates today , they could kill the stock market and hurt the economy badly . They have to weigh that against the risk of posible inflation down the road , " said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Minneapolis - based Norwest Corp . Analysts almost unilaterally say rates will remain steady until at least later in the year when growth is expected to pick up steam , which could prompt the central bank to raise the cost of money before faster growth fuels higher inflation . An avalanche of fresh data released over the past week suggests the economy is cruising along steadily and should be enough to help central bank chief Alan Greenspan convince his fellow governors not to slam on the brakes this time . Producer prices fell for a record seventh month in July and consumer prices so far this year have risen at their slowest pace in 11 years . Despite an increasingly tight labor market , real wages are actually declining . " There don ' t seem to be any inflationary pressures either in the pipeline or out in the open , " said Sohn . " There ' s really not any urgent reason for them to pull the trigger . " The central bank last changed interest rates on March 25 , when it raised the federal funds rate - - the rate banks charge for lending money to each other overnight - - by a quarter percentage point to choke off any signs of inflation . The Fed stood pat at its last two meetings in May and July . Analysts said that was largely due to Greenspan pulling his weight and arguing the economy would calm down all by itself . He was right . Economic growth slowed markedly from the whopping pace of expansion seen earlier this year after the March rate rise , dipping to 2 . 2 percent in the second quarter from 4 . 9 percent in the January - March period . Analysts said the strike at United Parcel Services , the nation ' s top delivery company , is certain to be one of the topics of debate when the governors convene around the large polished oak table in the Fed ' s executive conference room . The strike by the Teamsters Union , which represents some 185 , 000 UPS employees , has hurt businesses across the country . One of the workers ' key demands is that UPS creates more full - time jobs with higher pay and better fringe benefits . " It could translate in at least an upward drift in labor costs and perhaps even prices , " said Jones . " ( Greenspan ) does pay attention to this kind of anecdotal evidence . " But any increase in wage pressures is unlikely to trickle through into higher inflation rates before later in the year . Combine that with latest signs that economic activity is picking up again , and it all adds up to the strong likelihood of a rate increase at one of the Federal Open Market Committee next meetings this or next year . " Inflation is going to come sooner or later but only slowly and gradually . Greenspan may decide to pull the interest rate trigger either in September or in November , " said Sohn . Other analysts firmly believe rates will not be raised until well into next year . Rising bond yields already suggest investors ' expectations of tighter credit in the medium term . But for now , they need not lose sleep over higher rates , analysts agree . " The world isn ' t quite as perfect as it was perhaps at the previous meeting , but it still is awfully good , " said Jones .

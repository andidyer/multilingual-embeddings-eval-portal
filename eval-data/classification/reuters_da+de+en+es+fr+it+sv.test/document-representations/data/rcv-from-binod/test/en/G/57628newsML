CYCLING - INDURAIN MOVES INTO TOUR CONTENTION . Alex Zuelle and Miguel Indurain joined the Tour of Spain victory challengers after finishing second and third respectively behind Tony Rominger in Tuesday ' s time - trial . With 12 stages remaining , the outcome seems to be between these two , plus third - placed Laurent Jalabert and 1991 winner Melchor Mauri , fourth . Rominger ' s triumph in the 46 km solo test served only as a consolation prize because the Swiss dropped more than seven minutes on the leaders on the fourth stage . " For me the Vuelta is already lost , " said Rominger after beating Zuelle by two seconds . Indurain was a further 25 seconds back , according to unofficial timings . New overall leader Zuelle heads Indurain by one minute four seconds and Jalabert by 1 : 15 . " Alex is a great rider , it will be difficult to catch him , " said Indurain . " It was one of the strangest time - trials of my career . The wind hit from all sides , I didn ' t like it " . Jalabert , who ensured his 1995 Tour victory in Avila , was out of luck this time after being slowed by a puncture on the city ' s cobbled streets . The Frenchman was fifth , 1 : 52 seconds behind Rominger , and just two behind Spain ' s Mauri . Zuelle , Mauri , Jalabert and fifth - placed Australian Neil Stephen all ride for Spain ' s ONCE team . The trial took its toll on Italian sprinters Fabio Baldato and Giovanni Lombardi , first and second overall , and they dropped out of contention . The Tour continues on Wednesday with the 197 km 11th stage from Avila to Salamanca .

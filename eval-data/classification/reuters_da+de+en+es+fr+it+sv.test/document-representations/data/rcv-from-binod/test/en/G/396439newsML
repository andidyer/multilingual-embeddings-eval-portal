HORSE RACING - FRUSTRATED SHEIKH HAMDAN SOUNDS WARNING . Dubai ' s Sheikh Hamdan al - Maktoum , one of the world ' s most successful owner - breeders , has voiced frustration at the problems of British racing and sounded a warning about continued investment there . Britain ' s National Lottery has attracted money which used to be spent in betting and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke disappointed the industry in his latest budget . In addition , prize money remains generally low . " Racing is an expensive hobby , owning and breeding racehorses costs a great deal of money . No one can rely on the sport to make big profits , but you should certainly be able to hope to cover your expenses , " Sheikh Hamdan , Clarke ' s opposite number in the United Arab Emirates government , said in remarks published on Sunday . " We were first attracted by the traditions of British racing , plus the fact that English as a language is familiar , but you cannot go on investing all the time , " said the sheikh , whose blue and white colours have been first past the post many times over the last two decades . He has won the Epsom Derby twice , with Nashwan in 1989 and Erhaab five years later . " Racing in Britain is a huge industry . Maybe a million families are reliant on the sport . That underlines the importance of a solution being found , " Sheikh Hamdan told Gulf Today newspaper in an interview at Dubai ' s Nad al - Sheba track . " You cannot keep going back to the government for more support . From my point of view I feel that the solution has to come from within the sport , between administrators and the bookmakers . The Jockey Club should find a solution . " Sheikh Hamdan said bookmakers were taking their profits from racing and investing outside the sport . They had to invest further in the product which made their money . " From an owner ' s perspective , we see prize - money levels stagnating , while basic costs such as training fees , transportation and veterinary bills are all rising . The difficulties are plain to see . " Sheikh Hamdan is deputy ruler of Dubai and a leading member of the emirate ' s racing - mad ruling Maktoum family . His brother , Sheikh Mohammed , is the world ' s most successful owner - breeder and another brother , Sheikh Maktoum al - Maktoum , has also enjoyed many big - race victories . Sheikh Mohammed was the inspiration behind the world ' s richest race , the Dubai World Cup , which is being run this year on March 29 .

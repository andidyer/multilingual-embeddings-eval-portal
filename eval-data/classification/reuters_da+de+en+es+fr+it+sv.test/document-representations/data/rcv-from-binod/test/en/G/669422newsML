Major bows out as UK Conservative leader . Flanked by the men who would succeed him , John Major turned in a final feisty performance in parliament on Wednesday as leader of Britain ' s Conservative party . If Major experienced any sadness at ending 6 - 1 / 2 years as leader , he did not show it . He went through the ritual of attacking Labour leader Tony Blair and smiled at the compliments - - and jibes - - that his departure sparked . But his appearance at the dispatch box of the House of Commons was a sideshow next to the extraordinary manoeuvring in the party over whether he would be replaced by former finance minister Kenneth Clarke or ex - Welsh secretary William Hague . Hague , arms crossed , sat on Major ' s left . To his right sat Clarke , arms crossed . The body language revealed the Conservatives remain just as divided after their election defeat on May 1 as before . To the end , Europe , the subject that dogged Major throughout his premiership and helped bring down his predecessor Margaret Thatcher , was to the fore . Major did his duty to the end with a dogged probing of Prime Minister Blair ' s part in the European Union ' s Amsterdam summit that showed a masterly grasp of detail . Many believe he was a much better diplomat than he was a politician . " You have missed the opportunities of this summit . What you have reported is not a triumph but a travesty , " Major concluded , raising a half - cheer from the depleted ranks of Conservative MPs with much weightier things on their mind . By Thursday afternoon , they will have chosen either Hague or Clarke as their new leader and Major will be history . Will the history books treat him kindly ? Paddy Ashdown , the leader of Britain ' s third party , the Liberal Democrats , sketched out one epitaph . " He is the fourth - longest - serving prime minister of this century . He led this country in time of war , he gave Ireland a chance for peace , and I venture to say he ' s the only leader of the Conservative party who might have kept this lot together for the last three or four years , " Ashdown declared at prime minister ' s question time . Pointing to the Conservative ranks , Ashdown went on : " For that , they should be grateful to him and we shall miss him - - I think ! " There was laughter , but not much of it was on the Conservative side of the House . In truth , no one from Major ' s party did him the courtesy at his last question time of praising his stewardship . Many Conservative MPs blame him for their election defeat . He believes their obsession with , and divisions over , Europe led inevitably to their downfall . The kind words were left to Ashdown - - memorably dismissed by Major in tenser times as pious and pompous - - and Blair , who told him : " However strongly we clashed , you always behaved with very good nature and dignity . " Dignified and good - natured could hardly be used to described the last lap of the race to succeed Major . Clarke ' s link - up with his ideological foe , Euro - sceptic former cabinet minister John Redwood , sent Conservative right - wingers into paroxysms of anger as they sensed the leadership slipping away from the grasp of their man Hague . Thatcher denounced what she called " an incredible alliance of opposites , which can only lead to further grief " . Ex - finance minister Norman Lamont turned on Redwood , accusing him of " breathtaking cynicism " and warning that his alliance with Clarke , leader of the pro - European Conservative left , was built on sand and could not last . But the palm went to veteran MP Sir Peter Tapsell , who described Redwood ' s decision as " one of the most contemptible and discreditable actions by a senior British politician I can recall during my 38 years in the Commons " . As he surveys the wreckage of his party , Major must be glad that someone else will be picking up the pieces . REUTER

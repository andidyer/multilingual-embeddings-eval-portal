Germany acknowledges guilt in Guernica massacre . Germany acknowledged on Sunday the guilt of its pilots in the destruction of the Spanish town of Guernica 60 years ago , but stopped short of apologising for Europe ' s first aerial bombardment of civilians . The raid on April 26 , 1937 , conducted by Germany to aid the nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War , killed between 500 and 1 , 000 people and devastated the spiritual capital of the northern Basque region . But more than the number of dead , it was the deliberate massacre of civilians that transformed Guernica into a symbol for the horrors of war and inspired Pablo Picasso ' s anti - war masterpiece " Guernica " . In a ceremony commemorating the victims , Germany ' s ambassador to Spain , Henning Wegener , read a message of mourning and reconciliation from President Roman Herzog . " On April 26 , 1937 , Guernica fell victim to an air strike by formations of Legion Condor , which made the name of the city the symbol for a type of warfare that affected a defenceless population in like manner cruelly and unprepared . " The day of Guernica and the human suffering for which this name stands , are since part of the collective memory of our peoples , " Herzog ' s message read . While the text recognised the guilt of the German pilots , it contained no apology nor words of regret . On Thursday , the German parliament rejected a motion to discuss the bombing raid . Opposition members had wanted parliament to express formally its regret , but Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s coalition voted against a debate . " I would like to confront the past and would like to explicitly admit to the culpable involvement of German pilots , " Herzog ' s message read . " To you , as survivors of the attack , as witnesses of the horror that was sustained I direct my message of commemoration , of sympathy , and of mourning . . . To you , who still carry the wounds of the past , I offer my hand with a plea for reconciliation . "

FANS RIOT AFTER SEEING SYRIA LOSE ARAB GAMES FINAL . Angry Syrian spectators wrecked hundreds of seats at Beirut ' s stadium after their national team lost 1 - 0 to Jordan in the soccer final on the closing day of the eighth pan - Arab Games on Sunday . Some 30 , 000 Syrians destroyed an estimated 400 seats and hurled rubbish and empty bottles at the players while Syrian players beat and kicked Lebanese photographers , witnesses said . The Lebanese army evacuated the stadium but no casualties were reported in the incidents . Beirut ' s stadium , destroyed by Israeli bombs in the civil war , was rebuilt for the games at a cost of $ 50 million . Egypt were the big winners in the two - week games which were also tainted by Arab political rivalries and doping . With 97 golds , 57 silvers and 40 bronzes , Egypt were well ahead of their closest rivals Algeria who won 43 , 44 and 44 . Officials disqualified 12 athletes from the games for doping . They included five Egyptian athletes , two Saudis , an Algerian , a Tunisian , two Syrians and one Kuwaiti . It was the first time that Arab athletes had been thrown out for doping since the games were launched in 1953 in Alexandria , Egypt . The games had started with controversy when Lebanon , under pressure from conservative and influential Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , barred 97 Iraqi athletes from competing . They were stranded at the Syrian - Lebanese border without visas for two days before heading home . The Games were the first major international event staged in the Lebanese capital since the end of the 1975 - 1990 civil war . About 2 , 200 athletes from 19 countries took part in 20 sports . On Sunday the flag of the games was handed over to Jordan which will host the next edition in 2001 .

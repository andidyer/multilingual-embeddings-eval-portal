JCI SIGNS 500 MLN RAND DEAL WITH EDS . JCI Ltd said on Thursday it had signed a 500 million rand , 10 - year information technology ( IT ) outsourcing deal with Electronic Data Systems Inc of the U . S . JCI said the deal allowed it concentrate on its core mining businesses . It added that outsourcing IT allowed it to stay at the forefront of the fast - moving industry in a way that an in - house operation no longer could . " The deal creates a partnership between a world - class IT services provider and a dynamic mining house which is operating on an increasingly international scale , " the firm said in a statement . EDS , the world ' s largest IT services firm with about 100 , 000 employees worldwide , recently signed a one billion rand outsourcing deal with South Africa ' s Standard Bank Card Division . The JCI deal will see about 100 workers transfer to EDS . The firm said they would be offered broadly similar employment packages and there will be no job losses . The outsourcing move will further streamline the group ahead of talks by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd on the sale of its majority shareholding in JCI . The negotiations are expected to kick off soon . Analysts expect the sale of the JCI stake to be similiar to the Johnnic deal , when 23 black business groups came up with 2 . 7 billion rand to buy control of Johnnic . The Johnnic deal gives blacks control or influence over companies representing nearly a tenth of the capitalisation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange . - - Johannesburg newsroom + 27 11 482 1003

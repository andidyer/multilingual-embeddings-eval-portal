Malaysia cuts wheat flour price from Sunday . Malaysia plans to lower the price of wheat flour to 1 . 0 ringgit a kg from 1 . 10 ringgit from March 16 , Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Abu Hassan Omar said on Saturday . This was in response to an increase in the world production of the commodity , he told a news conference . Last June , Malaysia raised the wheat flour price to 1 . 10 ringgit a kg from 80 cents due to higher global grain prices at the time . Abu Hassan said higher flour production , especially by major producers like Australia , Argentina , Canada and the United States , had caused the monthly average price to go down to $ 200 per tonne from $ 249 . 98 . He said the situation was expected to continue for a year until February 1998 . " After the period , the government will review again the price based on development in the world market , " he said . Abu Hassan added that the government would ensure adequate supply of the commodity in the country .

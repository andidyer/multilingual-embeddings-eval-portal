World Bank says Asia export slowdown short - term . A recent slowdown in export growth in East Asia would be short - term and was not a sign of deeper structural changes in competitiveness , a World Bank official said on Thursday . Russell Cheetham , bank vice president for East Asia and the Pacific , linked the decline in export growth to shifts in foreign exchange rates , particularly the yen ' s recent slide against the dollar . He said the drop in global electronics components prices also hurt the region due to a heavy reliance among many East Asian economies on the electronics sector . " We see this as a short - term phenomenon . We don ' t believe it heralds the beginning of East Asia ' s demise as a leading exporter , " Cheetham told reporters after a ceremony for a training programme between Singapore and the World Bank . The programme aims to provide training for Asia - Pacific developing countries in areas including finance and banking , social insurance , productivity and port and airport management . Kishore Mahbubani , permanent secretary of Singapore ' s Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said the programme was consistent with the island republic ' s objective of serving as a bridge between developed and developing countries . Singapore has similar training agreements with seven countries including Australia , Canada and Germany as well as the Asian Development Bank and the Commonwealth Secretariat .

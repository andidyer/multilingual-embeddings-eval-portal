UK Channel 4 to pay ITV companies 87 . 1 mln pounds . Britain ' s Channel Four ( C4 ) must pay the ITV companies 87 . 1 million pounds for 1996 under the controversial funding formula arrangement , the Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) said on Thursday . Under the formula , when C4 ' s revenue exceeds 14 percent of the combined advertising and sponsorship income of itself and ITV , it must hand over 50 percent of the surplus to the ITV licensees . The ITV companies are required to support C4 if its income dips below that 14 percent level . The formula was intended as a safety net for C4 but the channel ' s success in attracting advertising has resulted in a windfall for the ITV companies . The ITC determined that 1996 total terrestrial qualifying revenue was 2 . 26 billion pounds , making C4 ' s minimum income 315 . 9 million . It in fact earned 490 . 3 million and must therefore hand over 87 . 1 million , taking into account a minor revision to the previous year ' s figures . The remainder of the surplus may be used to meet current expenditure at C4 . C4 kept up its attack on the funding formula , which is expected to be scaled back considerably from 1998 . " This fourth annual payment brings the total revenues which C4 has had to give away to 257 million pounds , " said managing director David Scott . " This is money diverted from British programming and film making into the pockets of ITV ' s already well - rewarded shareholders . Following parliament ' s sympathetic recognition of our case , we are delighted that relief is at hand , with the funding formula to be phased down after just one more payment . " Unlike the ITV companies , C4 is a non - profit making corporation with a remit to cater for minority tastes . While ministers have said they accept C4 ' s argument that the levy should be reduced , the actual details are not expected to be discussed until late this year . An ITV spokesman said that the network would not like to see complete abolition of the formula . But he dismissed reports in the trade press that ITV was about to submit a report to the government strongly criticising C4 ' s output . - - Keith Weir , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8793

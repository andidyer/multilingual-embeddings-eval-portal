Bank Austria mum on Creditanstalt bid . Bank Austria , widely seen as leading the race for Austrian selloff candidate Creditanstalt , said on Thursday it had no comment on whether a meeting of its supervisory board had decided to adjust its offer for the bank . " After a round of intensive talks , we have no comment to make , " a spokesman for Bank Austria told Reuters . Bank Austria is believed to have submitted the highest bid for the state ' s 70 percent voting stake in Creditanstalt , offering 16 . 8 billion schillings for the entire package . A rival consortium of bidders led by Austro - Italian insurer EA - Generali on Wednesday decided to improve its previous offer of 13 . 8 billion schillings for the bank stake , but declined to say by how much . Finance Minister Viktor Klima had given bidders a final Friday deadline to adjust their offers and is expected to pick the winner in the politically charged privatisation battle before or over the weekend . The country ' s dominant Social Democrats support Bank Austria ' s bid , while their junior coalition partner , the conservative People ' s Party , favours the consortium . The row has led to a deep split between the goverment partners . - - Vienna newsroom + 431 53112 274

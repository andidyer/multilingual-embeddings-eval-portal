Lebed says Russian chaos grows in Yeltsin ' s absence . Russian security chief Alexander Lebed , painting a picture of deep instability as President Boris Yeltsin prepared for heart surgery , on Thursday warned that Russia was on the brink of chaos and the army could soon mutiny . " We are at a dangerous limit , a very dangerous limit . It is not a time to fight . We must get out of the abyss , " he told a news conference . Lebed made a stream of controversial statements only hours after Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin issued a rallying cry aimed at heading off dissension in his cabinet in the prolonged political uncertainty over Yeltsin ' s health . Doctors said on Wednesday Yeltsin was fit enough to have heart surgery but they delayed his planned bypass operation for at least six weeks to improve the chances of success . Lebed , widely regarded as jostling for power with Chernomyrdin in Yeltsin ' s absence , said decision - making had practically dried up and some parts of Russia faced disaster . " The will of the state has gone . . . Many people have adopted a wait - and - see position , " the blunt - spoken , 46 - year - old retired paratroop general said . He cited major security threats including unsafe atomic power plants and possible contamination from nuclear submarines . He repeated his view made in a newspaper interview on Wednesday that the underfunded army was close to mutiny . But he found himself immediately at variance with Defence Minister Igor Rodionov who said the situation in the armed forces was under control . It was not clear what Lebed ' s aim was in making his comments but they again highlighted his tendency to step out of line with others in Russia ' s leadership . Chernomyrdin made clear he would not tolerate any lobbying by his cabinet ministers to protect their own interest groups as they draw up the 1997 budget , which needs parliament ' s approval . " If members of the government start playing any kind of game there , in the State Duma ( lower house of parliament ) , I warn them that whoever they are , whatever their rank , they will not work here , " Interfax news agency quoted him as saying . Chernomyrdin ' s comments appeared partly to be a veiled warning to his colleagues not to follow Lebed , who is not in the cabinet , down the path of outspoken criticism . But he held out an olive branch to Lebed by saying defence spending should be reviewed because the ministry had not had a fair hearing . " The defence ministry had not been listened to at all , " Interfax quoted the 58 - year - old prime minister as saying . Yeltsin , as if to underline that he can still work , reprimanded the government over its failure to resolve a strike by power workers in Russia ' s far east . Itar - Tass news agency quoted a presidential spokesman as saying Yeltsin has demanded that a deputy prime minister be sent urgently to the region to deal with the crisis . Measures taken so far to ease social tension had been insufficient , he said . Yeltsin is expected to stay for the time being at Moscow ' s Central Clinical Hospital , where he has been since September 13 , although one doctor said on Wednesday he believed he might spend some of his time before surgery at a residence outside Moscow .

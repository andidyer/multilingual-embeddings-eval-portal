Skanska to redeem shares worth 5 bln Skr . Swedish construction company Skanska said on Monday it intended to redeem one in every 10 shares at 400 crowns each , totalling five billion crowns . Skanska ' s board also intends to propose an additional transfer of capital to shareholders , which will probably be implemented in conjunction with the annual meeting in 1998 , the company said in a statement . Profit per share will rise to 33 . 9 crowns from 31 . 6 crowns based on final 1996 figures and adjusted for the effects of the redemption and a related new share issue , the company said . Shareholders equity per share will decrease to 83 . 7 from 113 . 6 , it said . The group will propose to carry out a new share issue equivalent to the par value of redeemed shares but not exceeding 126 million crowns and to approve a bonus issue to restore the capital stock . " By taking these steps , Skanska will not need court permission to register the resolution to reduce the capital stock , " it said , adding that it would thereby avoid the time consuming procedure of notifying known and unknown creditors . The transfer of the 8 - 10 billion crowns Skanska previously promised its shareholders could not be carried out in one go . " After the dividend proposed at the annual meeting of shareholders , the distributable earnings available in Skanska total 6 . 676 billion crowns , " it said . " Consequently , the entire transfer of 8 - 10 billion in excess capital that Skanska has promised its shareholders cannot be implemented at one time . " " After the completion of the share redemption programme that it is now proposing , the board intends to propose an additional transfer of capital to Skanska shareholders , which will probably be implemented in conjunction with the annual meeting in 1998 . " Those who are registered as shareholders on May 28 will receive redemption rights and Skanska shares will be trading excluding the rights as of May 26 , it said . Trading in redemption rights will take place from June 3 to 27 with the application period for share redemption running from June 3 to July 2 . The redemption , which is conditioned on shareholders approval at an extraordinary meeting on May 23 , will reduce the number of shares by 12 , 592 , 386 to 113 , 331 , 474 before the planned new share issue . Skanska intends for a second extraordinary meeting on August 4 to adopt a final resolution to redeem and reduce the capital stock . " It ( the meeting ) will also adopt a resolution approving the bonus issue , thereby increasing the par value of each Skanska share from 10 crowns to 12 , " it said . Skanska added it could probably pay in August . The group ' s financial position would remain strong with a 24 . 0 percent pro forma equity - to - assets ratio as of December 31 , 1996 , compared to 31 . 6 percent before the redemption , Skanska said . - - Birgitta Forsberg , Stockholm newsroom + 46 - 8 - 700 1017

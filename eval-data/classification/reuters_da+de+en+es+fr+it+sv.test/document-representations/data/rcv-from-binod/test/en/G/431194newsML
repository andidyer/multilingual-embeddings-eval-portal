Egypt shows " amazing " Pharaonic statue found in mud . Egypt unveiled on Monday a statue of a woman and four children probably carved in a royal workshop at least 3 , 000 years old and found last week by a man digging foundations for a house in the Nile Delta . Ali Hassan , the government ' s chief Egyptologist , told a news conference the metre - high ( three - foot - high ) inlaid statue ranked in quality with some of the best pieces in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . Hassan said he had ordered archaeologists to comb the area in case the statue of a seated woman with four children on her lap turns out to be part of a cache of statues , hidden for safekeeping . " It ' s really amazing . We do have ( a prized diorite statue of the Pharaoh ) Chephren as a piece of art in the museum . I can put this piece at this level . This is something unique , " said Hassan , secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities . Unusual features of the statue include inlaid cornelian necklaces on the children , the composition of the group , the woman ' s braided hair and the reliefs of baboons on the sides of the chair . One baboon is carrying a mirror . " The face , the pectoral and the inlaid stones are signs that this statue definitely comes from the royal workshop . This could not be done for a normal person , " Hassan said . Another sign of a royal connection is the lock of hair hanging down the side of the face of one of three miniature children standing on her lap beside one seated child , he added . " This type of lock was worn only by princes , " he said . But it will be hard to identify the woman or her status or fix the date of production precisely because the limestone statue bears no inscription . " She could be the king ' s nursemaid , a singer in the temple or an important priestess . Such jobs had a connection with the royal family , " he said . The statue is smaller than life - size - - 95 cm ( three feet ) high and 25 cm ( 10 inches ) across at the widest . It was found on March 2 near the Delta town of Zagazig , about 300 metres ( yards ) from the temple of the Pharaoh Pepy I at the ancient site of Tell Basta . But Hassan said he doubted the statue was as ancient as the Old Kingdom temple , which dates to about 2300 BC . " This sort of sculpture doesn ' t belong to the Old Kingdom , it could be from the New Kingdom or a little bit later . " he said . " This style of arranging the hair shows that it is from the New Kingdom . My guess is late New Kingdom . " The New Kingdom , the period when Egypt reached the peak of its power , lasted from about 1600 to 1100 BC . " The statue was not found in its original place . I believe someone at some time in the past took it and hid it there . Originally it would have been in a temple , a holy place or a residence , " Hassan said . The archaeologists are also looking for missing pieces of the statue , including the upper part of the fourth child , who was seated on a cushion on the woman ' s lap . The cushion is another unique feature , unknown in other Pharaonic statues .

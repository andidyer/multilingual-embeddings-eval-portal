F & C moves into property investment with ESN funds . Foreign & Colonial Management Ltd is to move into commercial property after its acquisition in May of ESN Property Investments Ltd , the speciality manager for the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ' s UK property portfolio . Tim Bell , managing director of ESN PIL , said the equity investments of the 14 billion stg pension scheme had already been merged with F & C . But the $ 500 million commercial property portfolio would mark F & C ' s first venture into the sector . " F & C now wants to expand its range of products to include property investment , " he said . Bell will be joined at ESN PIL by four new directors : Farid Daemi as finance director , Julian Smith on Investment , Peter Harrington on Management and Charles Hampden - Smith on building consultancy . The group move to F & C ' s offices on November 4 . Bell noted that UK investors can only access the commercial property market directly , where the costs of dealing are high , or by buying property stocks in authorised unti trusts . " Also , the fund management community at large is short termist , " he added . " They won ' t stick their necks out for an illiquid asset which might mean they miss their benchmark . " But some investment houses have been lobbying the government and the Stock Exchange through groups such as the Investment Property Forum to allow the formation and listing of property investment trusts , or closed end investment companies . " The government should recognise that a vibrant and actively traded indirect property market based upon research is essential to avoid the boom / bust property cycle of the past , " said Bell . " Legislative changes must take place if this market is to develop . " He hopes that the forthcoming UK government Budget on November 26 will contain some announcement on property trusts to enable investors to build on a resurgence of interest in commercial property after years in the doldrums for the sector . " The whole property market at large is hoping we go down this route , " he added . Property investment trusts could offer similar benefits to the established Real Estate Investment Trusts in the US . " REITS have taken off in the last six years , although they were around long before that , because they offer improved liquidity , a good income stream and a healthy initial yield , " Bell said . The US market is estimated to be worth some $ 60 billion . In the UK the IPD property index is capitalised at around 50 billion stg but many companies have property assets they own directly . " They could be worth 250 billion stg , " Bell said . - - London newsroom + 44 171 542 6414

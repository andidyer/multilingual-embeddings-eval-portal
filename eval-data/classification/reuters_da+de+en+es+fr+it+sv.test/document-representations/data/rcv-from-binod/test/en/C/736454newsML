FEATURE - India firm ' s collapse exposes regulatory flaws . As a broker on Bombay ' s National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) Pradeep Bhavnani knows how to take losses as well as good times , but the most recent fiasco to blight India ' s financial sector just made him see red . Bhavnani invested 134 , 000 rupees ( $ 3 , 751 ) in the CRB Capital Markets Ltd group of finance firms and watched horrified as it then went belly - up in May , and he lost it all . Bhavnani was not alone , and many others were less well - off . Thousands of people all over India , drawn by the prospect of returns more than a third higher than those offered by other firms , also invested their money . Investigators and regulators picking up the pieces after the CRB group ' s collapse estimate its liabilities at 9 . 32 billion rupees ( $ 260 million ) . Rumours of its links to prominent politicians are also sweeping through banking circles . Financier Chain Roop Bhansali , who built up a group of 35 firms spanning interests in textiles , building materials and finance over 11 years , has said he wants to return the money to his investors . Few of them believe him . " The chances of getting the money back are a little slim , " Bhavnani told Reuters . " They ' re very remote . But we are fighting to get it back at every level . " Bhavnani has banded together with 600 investors to approach the courts and regulators for justice . " Among us , we ' ve lost a total of about 80 million rupees , " he said . The group asked Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral to intervene on humanitarian grounds and save at least the money of several senior citizens who put their life savings in CRB . " Their situation is so sorrowful , the tears will really come into your eyes to see them , " Bhavnani added . REGULATORS TIGHTENING UP SYSTEMSCleaning up after CRB ' s failure is one task , but India ' s financial sector watchdogs are concerned primarily with blocking loopholes in their regulations that might have triggered the CRB fiasco . The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , the central bank , which oversees the activities of the country ' s estimated 45 , 000 private financial companies , ordered each of them to apply afresh for registration before a July 8 deadline . It has also revised its statutory liquidity norms , regarding the assets each firm must maintain to keep within safe margins . The country ' s markets regulator , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) , also came in for its share of flak . " They are liable for gross dereliction of their duties , " said a group of angry investors in a case before the Bombay High Court . Analysts said the Reserve Bank gave the CRB group clearance in principle to set up a commercial bank even though it had been warned by SEBI of irregularities detected in CRB ' s mutual fund arm . SEBI initiated an inspection of the group ' s mutual fund in 1994 / 95 , which led to the appointment of an enquiry officer and a ban on the CRB Mutual Fund launching any new schemes until June 30 , 1996 . But in July 1996 , RBI cleared the plans for the bank . " We ' re going through a certain maturity curve where all the players , whether regulatory agencies , or rating agencies , must define their corners , their roles , " said R Shankar Raman , senior vice - president at L & T Finance . " For the RBI , it ' s been very unfortunate , " he added . " In intentions and spirit , the RBI was moving towards giving NBFCs ( non bank finance houses ) their place as adults in the finance sector . It ' s fairly creditable that the RBI has not come back and said that things they ' ve done should be rolled back . " It ' s quite gutsy for them to say that CRB is an aberration and the system needs to be tightened up . " MARKET REGULATOR PLANS TO COVER RATING AGENCIESSEBI officials say they are drawing up plans to regulate the functioning of the country ' s credit rating agencies , who according to many investors , worsened the situation by not blowing the whistle on CRB much earlier . The rating agency Credit Analysis and Research ( CARE ) gave CRB ' s scheme a top A + rating in February 1994 , and downgraded it to A last September . Only after RBI banned CRB from accepting further deposits did CARE slash this to C , dropping it further , to D , in May . " There are certainly lacunae in the information we receive from firms which seek ratings , " said the head of a rating agency who did not want to be named . " They arise out of the transition we are undergoing in our marketplace . Policies change , import duties , for instance , and obviously the analysis reflects two different inputs . " He did not believe rating procedures could effectively be regulated . " Essentially a rating is a matter of opinion . Each agency gives its own opinion . " Analysts believe that greater surveillance was the key . " RBI can ' t get into micro management , " said Shankar Raman . " It can define benchmarks and norms , capital adequacy norms , exposure ceiling , income provisioning norms , and so on . " But how does it manage the monitoring part ? The supervisory aspect needs to be addressed - - that is the issue . Anything that is a large number to tackle , the RBI cannot cope with . " INVESTORS WERE GREEDY , SAY ANALYSTSOthers saw the issue as a simple case of greedy investors getting their fingers burnt . " This is unsecured paper , " said the vice - president of corporate finance at the Indian arm of a major U . S . investment bank . " There ' s a clear link between risk and reward . " " If people are investors and there ' s an upside , there should be a downside also , " he added . " It ' s a question of investor psyche - - why did they get attracted by 22 percent when the other reputed companies were paying 15 percent ? " Investor groups have called for insurance cover for depositors . But economist Kirit Parikh of the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research , said this expedient would only push up the cost of funds . " I ' m against compulsory insurance because it will raise the cost of funds , " Parikh said . " Even those who don ' t need insurance will have to take it , and those who want the security should be willing to accept a smaller return . " ( $ 1 = 35 . 78 )

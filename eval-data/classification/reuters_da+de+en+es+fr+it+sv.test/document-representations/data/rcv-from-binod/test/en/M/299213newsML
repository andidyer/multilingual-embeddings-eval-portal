Stock market in final act of three - part play ? . For Wall Street it was a case of deja vu as stock prices bounded into record ground in the New Year , but a growing choir of experts believe the strongest bull market ever might be in the last act of a three - act play . Stocks got off to a spectacular start , as the Dow Jones industrial average powered to four record high closes this week for a gain so far in the New Year of nearly 3 percent . It put the Dow index within reach of the 7 , 000 mark . On Friday , the Dow ended up 78 . 12 points at a new high of 6 , 703 . 79 . For the week , it was up 159 . 70 points . The rally showed investors were still in a jubilant mood as they celebrated nearly ideal economic conditions - - moderate economic growth and low inflation . The two factors lifted the world ' s most closely - watched index of 30 - blue chip stocks 26 percent last year after a 33 . 5 percent gain in 1995 . In the past year , the market was boosted by the realisation that stocks were undervalued in relation to the outlook for lower long - term interest rates . But the concern now is that the market might be at a crossroads and the question being asked on Wall Street is : What is standing in the wings to prop up stocks this year ? Some investment managers say the market may now be running on empty . At best , they reckoned that stocks might go into a period of idleness this year rather than a big sell - off since the fundamental factors are the same , and inflation is not threatening for the time being . At worst , they say , the market could come under temporary liquidation pressure if the inflow of money into mutul funds , which has fuelled the run - up in stocks , is diverted elsewhere . Right now , the market is riding high on a wave of new cash pouring into mutual funds . Stocks get a lift from the seasonal pattern , which has come to be known as the " January effect " when money from corporated bonus payments , dividend distributions and annual retirement account contributions , pours into the market , making January the second best month of the year for stocks . December is the strongest month as the market rebounds after shaking off the downdraft from year - end tax selling and it gets a lift from another seasonal pattern - - the so - called Santa Claus rally . The market may have its toughest test after the January effect wears off , and Wall Street heads into the earnings period , facing the possibility that the strong corporate earnings of the last two years might be tough to repeat . There is also concern that the flow of mutual fund money that has fuelled the market ' s unconventional ascent might come to a halt as the risks outweigh the rewards . The general stock mutual fund last year returned an average of 20 percent , after gaining 31 percent in 1995 . For the last five years , stock funds have gained an eye - popping 106 percent . Indeed , tons of money have been funnelled into mutual funds . A total of $ 1 . 25 trillion has found its way into stock mutual funds , which is up from just $ 251 billion in 1989 . The total is equivalent to 23 percent of disposable personal income . Last year , stock mutual funds attracted $ 21 billion a month compared with an average of just $ 12 . 5 billion per month in 1995 . " There are few psychological feats in the world more difficult than simply remaining bullish in a bull market , " says James Dines , publisher of the Dines Letter , in Belvedere , Calif . " I ' m waiting for mass greed and that will mark the top for the stock market , " he said . " The first signal of mass greed will be seen in the capitulation of some famous pessimists and the disappearance of the people who are afraid of the market , just because it ' s up . " Robert Rodriguez , chief investment officer for First Pacific Advisors , in Los Angeles , Calif . , is also waving the yellow flag of caution . " My letter to shareholders was the most cautionary in probably the last 15 years , " he said . " The expectations of the investing public are unrealistic and the high market valuation creates the environment for some real disappointments . " He said the economy was moving into the seventh year of an economic recovery and the likelyhood was that corporate earnings will come under growing stress . " With the potential of greater profit margin surprises and the high valuation of stock prices , there is considerably less margin of safety or margin for errors . . . and I don ' t like those kinds of odds , " said Rodriguez , who manages FPC Capital Fund , a $ 570 million mutual fund that invests in small and medium - sized companies . He estimated that the stock market this year will rise 7 percent to 8 percent , and for the next five years , " in the single digit range . " " Optimists will say that we are in a new investment environment and that these new investors are more committed to long - term investing . . . and much of this new money is for retirement and therefore ' sticky , ' and it will not leave because of a stock market decline , " Rodriguez said . " We have heard this type of reasoning before , but it was being applied to Japanese investors back in the late 1980s , " he said . Rodriguez said that between 1989 and June 1996 when the value of the Japanese stock market crumbled 46 percent and Tokyo ' s Nikkei stock average plunged from a peak of 40 , 000 points to 14 , 000 , the assets in Japanese mutual funds dropped 91 percent . " The long - term sticky investors were the Japanese who turned out to be not so sticky , " he said . " Human nature does not change . " Among other indices , the Nasdaq Composite index closed up 5 . 82 points Friday at a record of 1 , 332 . 02 and for the week , it gained 21 . 34 . The Standard & Poor ' s index of 500 stocks rose 4 . 65 to a record of 759 . 50 . For the week , it rose 11 . 47 points . The American Stock Exchange index rose 4 . 30 to 586 . 04 , capping a gain of 13 . 59 for the week . The NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2 . 18 to a new high of 400 . 76 , and was up 6 . 70 from last Friday .

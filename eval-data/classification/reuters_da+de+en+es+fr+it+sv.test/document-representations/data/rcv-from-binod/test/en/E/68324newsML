FEATURE - Hong Kong ' s top shops defeat slump . Hong Kong ' s classy shops have proved their mettle after a two - year slump in retail sales in this mecca of consumerism , and while many have felt the pinch of the downturn , analysts say luxury stores are in fighting form . " 1996 is like 1995 which was a year which polarised retailers into winners and losers - - the ones that would expand and the ones that would contract , " said Kate Newman Mack , director of research at Kleinwort Benson . LUXURY RETAILERS AVOIDED BATTERINGLuxury retailers like Dickson Concepts ( International ) Ltd and Joyce Boutique Holdings Ltd have avoided the battering that many Hong Kong department stores have taken , with their high income target market protected from the economic woes of middle to lower income buyers . " For people who could afford to buy higher income products , the economic slowdown has impacted them less , " explained Ken Chan , senior economist at Nikko Research Center ( Hong Kong ) Ltd . " The middle end was the sector that was hit the most - - department stores and mid - range products . " Dickson Concepts announced last week that its Hong Kong Seibu unit would open a new department store in the Causeway Bay district in late 1997 . The retailer said in June it had agreed to acquire an 85 percent stake in Hong Kong Seibu Enterprise Co . " Since Dickson ' s strength is in the technical side of retailing and since that was Seibu ' s weakest point in its operation , the Dickson people should be able to turn around Seibu . It is a good mix of management style , " said Newman Mack . Upmarket clothing retailer Joyce Boutique is boosting its store area in the Kowloon district and has been adding designer names to its labels list . In February it said it had won the regional distribution rights for three new fashion labels - - Superga casual shoes , Eres Swinwear and Cutler & Gross spectacles . It became the exclusive retailer for Hugo Boss in Hong Kong in August . " It ' s always the labels that have done very well , " said Renee Tai , analyst at BZW Asia . " In this kind of retail environment it is better to target one group rather than hit everyone with everything . " Analysts said consumers have also been shifting towards boutiques , specialist retailers and shopping malls and away from department stores . " We are seeing niche market expansion but we are not seeing the mass market expansion because of that very reason , " said Morris Macleod , investment analyst at ING Barings . " For the high - end products that they are marketing in some of the niche markets , they continue to be doing fairly well . It ' s more the mass market that is not doing that well , " he said . Department stores like Wing On International Holdings Ltd and Sincere Co Ltd have seen their earnings sliced and are desperately seeking to cut costs . " Middle of the road stores have been very hard hit . The other retailers have to concentrate more on cutting their costs rather than expanding , " said Tai . Japanese department store Daimuru Inc scaled back its retail operations in Hong Kong and Isetan Co had to close its doors . " When the Japanese department stores came in the mid 1980s they set a standard which was significantly higher than local department stores and they did offer better quality and service . But they have been allowed to languish , " said Newton Mack . Analysts said Lane Crawford International Ltd seems to be struggling in a class of its own selling middle - end products at high margins . " Lane Crawford is looking to cut costs . They don ' t seem to be very good at managing a brand name whereas Dickson has just taken Escada ( corrects from Estrada ) from them and Joyce has taken Hugo Boss from them . That is where they are losing out , " said one analyst . Analysts said the store seemed to have lost its focus . " It ' s now a big shoe store with a lot of other stuff attached , " said one analyst . Lane Crawford , controlled by Wheelock and Co Ltd , posted a sharp drop in net profit for the financial year to March , down to HK $ 16 . 4 million from HK $ 131 . 7 million . It said last week it would close its loss - making department store in Singapore at the end of the month and would shut its Causeway Bay Windsor House store . " It is difficult to see how they are going to revitalise their market share , " said Newman Mack . Analysts said high - end stores had chosen the right time to expand - - ahead of an expected recovery in retail sales late this year or early next year and while property prices were still negotiable . " Dickson and Joyce are expanding at the bottom rather than the top . But you have to be good retailer to be able to afford it , " said Newman Mack . " If you can afford to expand at the bottom of retail cycle and if you are canny enough to get the upturn right then you are going to be ahead of the competition , " she added . Kleinwort Benson is expecting consumption growth of 3 . 3 percent in 1996 and a rise to 4 . 2 percent in 1997 . Analysts are counting on an influx of tourists into Hong Kong around the time of the British colony ' s mid - 1997 handover to China to boost retail sales . But the high - end stores are the most likely to benefit from the influx , the analysts say . The tourism industry has predicted at least a 10 percent increase in the number of travellers into Hong Kong next year linked to the historical handover of the British territory to China . The volume of advance hotel and airline bookings already have signalled a tourist invasion will take place . " Tourists spend in big hotels and on high end products , " said Chan . ( 1 $ = 7 . 7 HK dollars )

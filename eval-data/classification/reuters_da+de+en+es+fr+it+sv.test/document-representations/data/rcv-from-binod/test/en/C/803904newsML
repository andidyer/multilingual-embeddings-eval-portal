Swedish state - owned power company Vattenfall said on Friday it planned to relist Bolivian Power Company , formerly called Cobee , on the New York Stock Exchange within a year . " Our intention is to go back to the bourse at a suitable time , within a year , " Gunner Vallin , senior vice president Vattenfall AB International , told Reuters . " We will list the company to finance the planned expansion . " There is a large developing potential in South America and we and NRG will keep control of the company , " he said , adding they would issue new shares .

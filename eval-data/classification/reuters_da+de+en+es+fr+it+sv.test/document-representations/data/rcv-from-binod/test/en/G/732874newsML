German TV news turns increasingly negative on Kohl . German television news coverage of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has grown increasingly critical in recent months , according to a study of leading German networks published on Wednesday . The Medien Tenor newsletter said that nearly 40 percent of the comments made about Kohl ' s economic and financial policies in news reports broadcast on ARD , ZDF , RTL and SAT - 1 networks in the first half of 1997 were negative . That was up sharply from less than 20 percent in the first half of 1996 and well above levels beneath 15 percent seen in the first half of 1995 . The number of positive comments had declined to less than five percent from about eight percent two years ago , the independent Bonn - based newsletter said . " Helmut Kohl has not been rated so poorly in the television news coverage since before the last elections in 1994 , " the Medien Tenor newsletter said . It also noted that the percentage of negative comments broadcast on those networks from members of Kohl ' s own conservative party had clinbed to nearly 30 percent from less than five percent a year earlier . - - Erik Kirschbaum , Bonn newsroom , 49 228 260 97160

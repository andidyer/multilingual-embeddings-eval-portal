The median forecast of economists is for year average growth of 3 . 0 percent , and they said the lower growth result may have some impact on the budget bottom line . With unemployment still seen fairly high by mid year , tax receipts should be lower than expected and welfare payments will probably be higher than expected . While the government stood by its 1996 / 97 forecast this week , economists said that as the 1997 / 98 budget is due in May , the government may still revise the growth forecast before year end . Against the expectations of lower growth in the current financial year , economists see growth in 1997 / 98 economists asbeing stronger than expected - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Employ Unemp Part Housing 1996 / 97 GDP ' 000s Rate Rate Finance yr averageABN Amro + 15 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 4 . 0 3 . 0Access n / a n / a n / a n / a 3 . 1 AMP flat 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 3 . 0 2 . 6 ANZ Bank - 10 8 . 5 63 . 6 + 3 . 0 2 . 8 ANZ Secs + 15 8 . 6 63 . 8 + 3 . 0 2 . 7 Axiom + 15 8 . 7 63 . 8 + 3 . 0 3 . 1 BT - 10 8 . 5 n / a - 1 . 0 3 . 0 BZW - 2 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 3 . 0 2 . 8 Citibank + 10 8 . 5 n / a + 5 . 0 3 . 1Colonial + 15 8 . 4 63 . 6 + 6 . 5 2 . 8Comm Bank + 10 8 . 4 n / a + 7 . 0 3 . 3County + 15 8 . 5 63 . 7 + 5 . 0 3 . 0CSFB + 10 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 1 . 5 3 . 1Deutsche + 10 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 7 . 0 3 . 1Dresdner + 14 8 . 5 63 . 7 + 1 . 5 3 . 25GIO + 15 8 . 3 63 . 6 + 4 . 9 n / aHambros flat 8 . 6 63 . 6 n / a 3 . 0 HSBC + 4 8 . 7 63 . 7 + 5 . 0 3 . 3Macquarie + 10 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 3 . 5 3 . 25Merrills + 8 8 . 7 63 . 7 + 5 . 0 n / aNAB + 10 8 . 6 63 . 9 n / a 2 . 75Nat Mut - 5 8 . 6 63 . 6 + 5 . 0 n / aNomura + 10 8 . 4 63 . 7 n / a 2 . 9Pru Bache - 10 8 . 8 63 . 7 n / a 2 . 9Rothschild + 10 8 . 4 63 . 5 + 6 . 2 2 . 9SBC Warburg flat 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 1 . 5 3 . 1 Schroders + 6 8 . 5 n / a + 4 . 0 3 . 0Soc Gen - 5 8 . 7 63 . 6 n / a 2 . 9 St George + 18 8 . 5 63 . 8 n / a 3 . 5Westpac + 5 8 . 6 63 . 8 + 6 . 0 2 . 8 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Low - 10 8 . 3 63 . 5 - 1 . 0 2 . 6 High + 18 8 . 8 63 . 9 + 7 . 0 3 . 5 Average + 6 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 4 . 0 3 . 0 Median + 10 8 . 6 63 . 7 + 4 . 0 3 . 0 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - LABOUR FORCE - Some moderate growth , although once again not enought to make any inroads into unemployment , is expected in January . With revised data showing the pace of growth slightly slower than originally reported last week , economists said employment should post its fifth consecutive rise , in line with expectations of a strengthening economy . One of the most watched indicators in the second half of the year , the expectation of the labour force statistics has lessened given the less likelihood of another rate cut in the past month . However , economists did say that after the growth of the December quarter the risks to employment growth are probably to the downside . HOUSING FINANCE - A rise in line with median expectations would take housing finance back to levels last seen around August 1994 . Economists said they were looking for a continuation of the recent trend away from refinancing and into new construction as the housing sector starts to recover from its two year slump . The preconditions for sustained recovery from the slump since mid - 1994 have been set in place , and economists are now looking for a run of positive housing finance numbers as the housing upswing gathers pace . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

Zaire trip on hold till after evaluation - Canada . Canada said on Tuesday the international rescue mission for eastern Zaire was now on hold until meetings this week clarified the situation there . " Decisions are not being made until those evaluations are finished , " Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said . He said a political meeting would be held in New York on Wednesday and a military meeting has been scheduled for Stuttgart on Thursday . Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien later said the Stuttgart meeting might be delayed until Friday . A flood of Rwandan refugees returning home from Zaire has led Rwanda ' s government to call for massive humanitarian aid instead of a military force , which it said was was no longer needed nor welcome . But the freeze by the international forces did not necessarily mean the mission was off . " At the present moment , as we are speaking , the mission is still there , " Chretien , who personally assembled international support for a military force to go to the region , told Parliament . But he said Rwanda had given assurances it would open the southern stretch of its border with Zaire , where aid agencies say hundreds of thousands of refugees languish . " We are told by the government of Rwanda that they will open the southern part to let the refugees come to Rwanda in the days to come , " Chretien said . " It might be in the next three to four days that we ' re in a situation where the armed forces are not required anymore . " Defence Minister Doug Young clarified Chretien ' s remarks later to say that Rwanda had assured mission commander Lt . Gen . Maurice Baril that non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) could cross into Zaire to assess refugee numbers and needs . " The border has been open and we ' ve had 500 , 000 people cross the border , " Young said . " What the prime minister was saying . . . is that we have assurances from the Rwandan government that we can see the movement from Rwanda into eastern Zaire , NGOs in particular , to be able to do an assessment . . . of the remaining refugees . " Axworthy and Young told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the situation was so fluid and information so fragmented that both Canada as mission leader and other participants were keen to get a clearer picture . " The situation is changing hour by hour , " Young said . " You don ' t start making a judgment until you have the right information . We know some of the major objectives have been obtained , " said Axworthy , who cancelled a trip to an Asia - Pacific summit in Manila to attend to the Zaire issue . " But we ' re still not sure , no one is sure , because you ' re getting different points of view as to what the situation of refugees are in eastern Zaire . " Axworthy said Canada and its allies wanted to make sure the U . N . Security Council mandate to help refugees was achieved . " And now that there ' s a new phase of humanitarian and peace - building activities , we want to determine how we can ensure coordination of international activities for those purposes . " Earlier on Tuesday International Cooperation Minister Don Boudria said hundreds of thousands of refugees remained behind in Zaire . Asked if this were still the case , Axworthy said , " There are a lot of fragments of information . There isn ' t a very complete picture at this time . " He said it was important to fulfil the Security Council mandate , which authorised a mission to help get aid to refugees and help get them home . The meeting in New York will examine what will be required to help the refugees , while the Stuttgart talks will examine what the military needs to do . In addition , Boudria told reporters a meeting of donor countries would be held under his chairmanship in Geneva on Saturday to examine what aid each country or international agency can bring . He said Rwanda had agreed to participate . In addition , Christine Stewart , Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa , announced she would visit South Africa and Ethiopia this week to discuss the situation .

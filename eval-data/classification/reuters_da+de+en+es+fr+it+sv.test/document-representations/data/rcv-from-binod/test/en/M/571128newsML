HK stocks open sharply lower on Wall Street slide . Hong Kong stocks opened sharply lower on Thursday with the Hang Seng Index dropping 158 points , or 1 . 16 percent , to 13 , 447 within the first few minutes of trade after the Dow industrials tumbled overnight . " The market just followed Wall Street , which slid on fears of an interest rate rise , " said Peter Lui , institutional sales trader at NAVA SC Securities . The Dow dropped 139 . 67 points , or 1 . 93 percent , to 7 , 085 . 65 on Wednesday , hit by a rise in the benchmark 30 - year U . S . bond yield which jumped back towards seven percent . Disappointing first quarter U . S . productivity data and a sagging dollar pushed the 30 - year bond down 29 / 32 on Wednesday to yield 6 . 96 percent . " But consistent buying on Hong Kong Telecom is helping to check the slide on the blue - chip index , " Lui said . Hong Kong Telecom rose HK $ 0 . 15 to HK $ 14 . 35 with 9 . 8 million shares worth HK $ 141 million changing hands . Brokers said heavy buying in the stock was fuelled by newspaper reports that China United Telecommunications Corp held talks with Cable & Wireless Plc about buying a stake in Hongkong Telecom . By the end of the first hour of trade , the Hang Seng had recovered to 13 , 508 , down 97 points or 0 . 71 percent on selective buying in blue chips . Turnover was HK $ 3 . 86 billion . HSBC Holdings narrowed its losses to HK $ 1 . 00 at HK $ 206 . 00 after an early fall to HK $ 204 . 00 . Michael Ng , dealing director at Sassoon Securities , said movement in the blue - chip index alone was not that significant as buyers were turning to individual quality counters or speculative stocks . Cheung Kong eased HK $ 0 . 75 to HK $ 72 . 75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties lost HK $ 1 . 25 to HK $ 89 . 50 . The Hang Seng Chinese Enterprise Index , which tracks the 26 H - shares , dropped 1 . 67 points , or 0 . 15 percent to 1 , 141 . 76 . Jilin Chemical was unchanged at HK $ 1 . 57 after recent gains while Jingwei Textile added HK $ 0 . 087 to HK $ 1 . 79 .

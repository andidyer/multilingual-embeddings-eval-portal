Six banana workers killed in northwest Colombia . Six banana plantation workers were killed by unidentified gunmen in two attacks on two estates in northwest Colombia on Tuesday , police said . The dead were all thought to be linked to the Hope , Peace and Freedom political movement , comprised of former guerrillas who had laid down their arms , regional police chief Col . Libardo Hernando said . " We cannot attribute these two simultaneous attacks to any one group in particular since there are conflicting reports . Some people say the killers were banana packers who had been fired . Others say they were opponents of Hope , Peace and Freedom , " Hernando said . The attacks took place in a rural area close to the town of Apartado , in the banana - growing region of Uraba , where leftist guerrillas and right - wing paramilitary groups have traditionally fought for control of lucrative contraband routes . In a separate incident 15 police and civilians were injured on Monday when a street vendor ' s cart exploded in Monteria , in neighbouring Cordoba province , outside a police headquarters . No group claimed responsibility for the blast but police blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , Colombia ' s largest guerrilla force .

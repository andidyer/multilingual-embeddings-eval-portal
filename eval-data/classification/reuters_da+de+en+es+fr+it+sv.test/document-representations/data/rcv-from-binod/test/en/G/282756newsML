Lamfalussy sees realistic chance EMU to be on time . European Monetary Institute ( EMI ) President Alexandre Lamfalussy wrote in a comment for Tuesday ' s edition of the German daily Handelsblatt that monetary union should happen on time , but also cautioned against market euphoria . Lamfalussy said increasing economic convergence had contributed to the fact that none of the EU currencies had recently come under strong pressure on exchanges . " At the same time one should guard against exaggerated optimism from markets which already stuck their necks out rather too far before the European Monetary System crisis in 1992 , " he said . " Considering all the problems which still remain to be solved there is a realistic chance of meeting the schedule for the transition to the third phase of monetary union ( in 1999 ) , " he said . " Of course there is always the danger of unforeseen events that can set the process back , for instance a worsening of the economic situation or damaging exchange rate developments outside Europe . " Lamfalussy said he had various reasons for believing EMU would take place on time . " The EMI will conclude its technical preparations on time , so that there will be no reason from that side to delay entry into currency union . " The convergence process is making progress which is likely to continue for some time . And finally , in many countries the political will can be seen to make EMU come about according to the agreed terms . "

HK marks Taiwan national day for the last time . About 1 , 000 supporters of Taiwan ' s Chinese Nationalist government staged a flag - hoisting ceremony in Hong Kong on Sunday to mark Taiwanese national day for the last time before the colony reverts to China in 1997 . Hong Kong is to return to Beijing ' s control at midnight on June 30 , ending a century and a half of colonial rule . The group expressed disappointment that from next year they will be barred from continuing a practice dating back more than 30 years of hoisting the Nationalist flag on the Sunday before the October 10 national day . " It is an infringement of our freedom which we have enjoyed for so many years , " group spokesman Tsui Fai - hung told reporters . Beijing ' s officials in Hong Kong have said no Nationalist flag would be hoisted in the territory after the handover . Beijing has regarded the island as a rebel province since the Nationalists fled there in 1949 after their defeat in the Chinese civil war . Many Kuomintang government supporters , unable to flee to Taiwan at the time , escaped communist rule by crossing the border into the British outpost in southern China .

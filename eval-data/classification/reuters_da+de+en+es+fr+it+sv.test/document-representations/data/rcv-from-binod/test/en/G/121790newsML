OPINION - UK MP Field eyes total welfare overhaul . Whoever wins Britain ' s next general election will face politically explosive decisions on how to rein in the burgeoning welfare state . For Labour , the task of " thinking the unthinkable " on welfare has fallen to Frank Field , the MP for Birkenhead and chairman of the House of Commons Social Security Select Committee . Field is not a member of Labour ' s front bench team but Labour leader Tony Blair has encouraged him to develop radical reforms for the party to consider . Here Field summarises his latest book How To Pay For The Future , published on Wednesday ( Institute of Community Studies , London , 40 ) , in which he aims for nothing less than " a total reconstruction of welfare " . Three main reforms are proposed - - to universalise pension coverage , to create a new mutually run national insurance scheme and to transform income support from a passive into an active agency . How To Pay For The Future proposes that the four million workers currently outside the National Insurance Scheme ( earning below the lower earnings level ) are brought within the scheme . This will ensure that everybody builds up contributions towards the state retirement pension . In addition workers earning above 100 a week will have to save towards a second funded scheme if they are not currently in a scheme which aims to provide two - thirds of current earnings in retirement . Individuals will be free to choose the firm or organisation through which they make these savings . How To Pay For The Future proposes that SERPS will be wound up for new accruals at the millennium . In the first year the opted - out rebate of 4 . 6 percent will in effect be universalised and paid into each contributor ' s new pension savings account . Each year the compulsory savings will be raised so that finally everybody is saving 16 percent of their wage or salary for retirement . Among the other proposed reforms is the establishment of a National Savings Pension Scheme and the replacement of existing tax allowances with a 6 , 000 tax allowance for pension savings . These tax allowances will roll over if they are not used in any one year . How To Pay For The Future also proposes a new National Insurance Corporation to run a national , mutually owned Insurance Corporation . The Corporation will initially have the responsibility of inroducing a new care pension and of ensuring that carers drawing the invalid care allowance gain more adequate pension coverage . Existing means - tested community care proposals will be replaced by a compulsory National Insurance scheme so that everyone who on medical grounds requires residential or nursing care gains it free of any means - test . The new Insurance Corporation will similarly be responsible for introducing a new unemployment insurance benefit . Unlike the current scheme , where individuals have to build up two years ' contributions after being out of work , eligibility for the new benefit will be gained after 13 weeks back in work . The aim is to encourage people to take risks in moving back into work . Three reforms are proposed in a shake - up of income support - - the minimum benefit paid to people who are unable to work . Income support will be transformed from a passive agency paying benefit to one which is geared to helping people into training and into work . Claimants will be required to produce career plans and income support payments will help them achieve these objectives . In order particularly to help single mothers , student grants are abolished and replaced by loans which will be paid back through the new National Insurance tax . The 1 . 1 billion student grant budget will be used for nursery and child care facilities . Lastly , poorer people will be trained to take some of the new nursery and child care jobs which results so that the wage packets can be kept and spent in the poorest areas . To pay for these proposals How To Pay For The Future proposes first a new insurance tax which will cover half the cost of the NHS . In addition the same tax base will be used to finance the new care pension , the new unemployment insurance , and the new pension for carers . Contributions for the health tax will be at 7 percent of each pound of earnings . Contributions to the other insurance benefits will go up but not exceed the current national insurance ceiling . These insurance payments will allow for major tax cuts . How To Pay For The Future proposes a 400 increase in personal allowances , a reduction from 20p to 5p for the starting rate of tax and a cut to 19p from 24p for the standard rate of tax .

Opposition boycotts Croatian parliament . Opposition deputies walked out of the Croatian parliament on Wednesday in protest at a lack of live state television and radio coverage of a planned debate on a controversial financial issue . State news agency HINA quoted leaders of the five main opposition parties later as saying they would boycott parliament for the rest of October unless proceedings were broadcast live on television and radio . " ( Debates on ) very important issues are not being broadcast on television . Now that radio coverage has been withheld ( too ) we have lost all direct contact with the voters , " Jozo Rados of the Social Liberal party told Reuters . He said 40 opposition party deputies ditched the session , leaving behind a dozen members of the governing Croatian Democratic Union which has a slim majority of seats , after their demands for live TV coverage were disregarded . Among other issues , an auditing commission report on state commodity reserves was to be debated by the Sabor , or lower house of parliament , which was more than half empty at the time because no legislation was being voted on . " These ( auditing ) issues are interesting because they indicate some illegal activities , " Marin Josipovic of the Social Democratic Party told Reuters . Croatian media recently broke a so - called " wheat scandal " in which the State Reserves Board was accused of speculation in wheat , causing a big increase in market prices . HINA quoted opposition MP Dino Debeljuh as saying the parties would boycott the whole session except for question time and those debates which were aired live . The parties called on the public to sign a petition calling for parliamentary debates to be broadcast live on television and radio , the agency said . Parties involved were the Croatian Peasant Party , the Social Democratic Party , Social Liberals , Istrian Democratic Parliament and Croatian Party of Rights . Rados said decisions on TV coverage of parliament were now made exclusively by state - run television HRT since consultations with the parliament presidency were abandoned . HRT , with a monopoly on nationwide television and radio news coverage , serves primarily as a mouthpiece for President Franjo Tudjman and his party , domestic critics say . " This situation simply went over the top and we had to do it ( walk out ) , " Josipovic said . Croatia on Wednesday was admitted to the Council of Europe , antechamber of the European Union , which binds members to European covenants on democracy and human rights .

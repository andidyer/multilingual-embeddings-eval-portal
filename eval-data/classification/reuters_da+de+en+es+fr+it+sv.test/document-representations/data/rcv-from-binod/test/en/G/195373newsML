Murder trial in Germany harms ties with Iran . Iran ' s relations with its main trade partner Germany plunged on Sunday with rising tempers , publicly aired insults and mass demonstrations at Bonn ' s embassy in Tehran over a murder trial . About 5 , 000 students chanting " Death to fascist Germany " and " Death to pro - America Germany " marched to the embassy from the mosque at Tehran university after midday prayers to protest against accusations by a German prosecutor that Iran ordered the killings of Kurdish dissidents in Berlin . Demonstrators threw eggs and tomatoes at the mission and more than 100 police including about two dozen riot police repelled several attempts by a dozen angry protesters to surge through their lines around the compound . " If it was not for our respect of the police , we would have entered the embassy and pulled down the German flag , " a rally organiser said over a loudspeaker . It was the second protest at the embassy since Friday . Tempers in Tehran have risen over the German federal prosecutor ' s allegation that Iranian leaders ordered the killings in Berlin ' s Mykonos restaurant in 1992 of three senior Kurdish opposition figures and their translator . More than 200 members of the 270 - seat parliament on Sunday called for a review of ties with Germany , Tehran radio said . They signed a letter asking the foreign ministry " to deliver its evaluation and a full report of its action on reviewing ties between the two countries " to the assembly , the radio reported . Majlis ( parliament ) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq - Nouri was quoted in Iranian newspapers on Sunday as saying Iran ' s response to the German government would be announced soon . Analysts said government reaction thus far has been mild . Potentially at risk are trade ties worth $ 1 . 4 billion last year and Europe ' s " critical dialogue " with Iran - - championed by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as an alternative to U . S . sanctions aimed at isolating the Islamic republic . Germany ' s envoy in Tehran was summoned to the foreign ministry on Thursday where Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi told him : " The German judiciary and judicial authorities , under the influence of the Zionists , have embarked on an evil political game against the Islamic Republic of Iran , " according to Iranian state television . " Their repetition of insulting remarks and baseless allegations against the highest authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran . . . shows that the German judiciary . . . has turned the Mykonos trial into a political one and has thus marred its credibility , " Sarmadi reportedly said . German prosecutors demanded life sentences for an Iranian and a Lebanese after accusing Tehran of ordering the killings . The German prosecutor ' s office told the court in Berlin that an Iranian special state committee , which allegedly included supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , had ordered the assassinations . " The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran does not accept , under any circumstances , such insulting actions and considers that responsibility for any consequences rests with the German government , " Sarmadi said . Iranian state television blasted Germany as a " political midget " and questioned extensive trade ties with Bonn . It asked whether Germany could be considered a trustworthy top trade partner , and said Bonn had disregarded its national interest just to appease Tel Aviv and Washington . Iran News , an English daily which reflects the views of the foreign ministry , said on Sunday many people had already demanded an end to trade and economic relations with Germany . " I think the best policy is to cut off all ties with Germany , " it quoted an unidentified expert as saying . A Kayhan International columnist said a dirty , high - profile propaganda campaign had been organised by " Zionist circles " and launched by Germany against Iran with the clear objectives of tarnishing the Islamic republic ' s image and appeasing Bonn ' s critics both at home and abroad . Iranian judiciary head Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said Tehran might release documents on alleged German help in making Iraqi chemical weapons during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war .

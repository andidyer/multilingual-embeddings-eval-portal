Up to 30 , 000 refugees flee fighting in east Zaire . Up to 30 , 000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees fled fighting in eastern Zaire on Saturday , abandoning their camp 80 km ( 50 miles ) from a major government - held town and airport , aid workers said . Brenda Barton , a spokeswoman for the U . N . World Food Programme ( WFP ) , said a WFP flight delivered six tonnes of food on Saturday morning to the camp about five km ( three miles ) from Kalima town . " Then another flight went in and was told on approach that there were problems on the ground . They landed , quickly unloaded their cargo and heard fighting nearby , " she said in Nairobi . The plane evacuated the last foreign aid workers from Kindu before another WFP plane was told from the ground to turn back . " A UNHCR ( U . N . High Commissioner for Refugees ) flight then flew over the area and noticed no refugees were there . It was told to turn around as there was fighting on the ground , " she said . The fighting , apparently between government troops and rebels , followed rebel leader Laurent Kabila saying on Friday he had delayed an offensive because of talks in South Africa . " We have temporarily stopped our intention of launching our counter - offensive during this time of negotiations as a sign of goodwill , " Kabila told Reuters in the eastern city of Bukavu . " We ' re willing to sustain this goodwill for a few days . " But if there is no advance on this question of negotiations we will be forced to launch our offensive . . . It ' s very important for us to push those people ( Zaire ) to the negotiating table . " Zaire ' s defence minister said on Friday the army would not ease off its counter - offensive , despite the tentative contacts in Cape Town towards the first talks between the warring sides . Kalima is 80 km ( 50 miles ) northeast of Kindu , a major government - held town on the Zaire river with a large airport . The estimated 30 , 000 refugees were described as nervous by aid workers on Wednesday because their camp was near the frontline and they were prevented by Zairean troops from entering Kalima . The refugees reached Kalima two weeks ago after fleeing the town of Shabunda to the east before it fell to rebel forces . UNHCR says that more than 200 , 000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees are unaccounted for in eastern Zaire since being uprooted by fighting between troops and rebels that started in October . The U . N . Department of Humanitarian Affairs on Saturday quoted UNHCR figures showing as of the end of January an estimated 193 , 000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees were located in large groups . UNHCR said an estimated 189 , 590 Rwandan and 39 , 675 Burundian refugees were unaccounted for after having estimated the number of births and deaths among them since they fled their camps in the east . UNHCR said a total of 1 . 25 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees were in eastern Zaire before a rebellion started in October last year and they were forced to abandon their camps . It said by the end of January a total of 815 , 996 refugees had returned from Zaire to Rwanda and Burundi and 10 , 168 had arrived in other countries , leaving 432 , 013 behind in Zaire . Zaire says it wants all the refugees to return home but many are trapped between government and rebel frontlines in the east . They include former Rwandan Hutu troops and militiamen , who had a leading role in Rwanda ' s 1994 genocide , and their families .

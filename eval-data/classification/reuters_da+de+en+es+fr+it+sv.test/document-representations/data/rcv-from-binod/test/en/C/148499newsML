Lufthansa launches cargo payment card . Payment card company Lufthansa AirPlus Servicekarten GmbH said it is now offering its Cargo Card to shippers , freight forwarders and express companies . Lufthansa AirPlus cargo services manager , Sigrid Morgiel , said the CargoCard could be used for payment between shippers , forwarders and airlines as well as for management information . A pilot scheme with small shippers delivering direct to Lufthansa Cargo had been successfully completed and the card was now on offer to the entire cargo community , she said at a news conference at the German Logistics Congress in Berlin . Talks were under way with large forwarders and other airlines were also interested in accepting the card as payment , but it was too early to give further details , she added . The CargoCard incorporated most airway bill information , including weight , air transport and additional costs , saved users administration time and speeded up payment , Morgiel said . Cardholders could analyse transport costs by route , by weight or other factors , she noted . Lufthansa AirPlus , in which Deutsche Lufthansa AG holds a 49 per cent stake , was also planning to introduce import payments on the card . Morgiel said : " We do not want to replace the airway bill for bookings but it could replace bills of delivery . " - - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax + 44 171 542 5017

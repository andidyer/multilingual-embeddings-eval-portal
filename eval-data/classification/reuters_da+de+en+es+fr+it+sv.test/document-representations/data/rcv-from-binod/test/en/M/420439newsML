FOREX FLOWS PUMP UP S . AFRICA MONEY SHORTAGE - SARB . A further rise of more than 800 million rand in South Africa ' s money market shortage on Tuesday was due to forex flows in the system , a Reserve Bank spokesman said on Wednesday . " It ' s basically forex flows . . . for the moment we ' re selling dollars to the market and obviously they ' re paying for that , " said Andre Kock , general manager of the bank ' s money and market capital division . The daily shortage leapt to 11 . 395 billion rand on Tuesday - - its highest level in at least 14 months according to the Reserve Bank - - following a rise of almost two billion rand on Monday to 10 . 548 billion rand . The shortage touched 11 . 126 billion rand at the end of December 1996 , its previous highest level , the bank said . " It depends on how many forward exchange contracts we have maturing . . . it varies , but at the moment the shortage is going up because of that and in due course it will swing around again , " Kock told Reuters . Short - term money market interest rates shifted slightly with three - month NCD rates edging higher between to 16 . 55 and 16 . 70 percent from 16 . 50 to 16 . 70 percent but the 90 - day BA rate was unchanged at between 15 . 90 and 16 . 10 percent . Central Bank governor Chris Stals said two weeks ago the bank was deliberately keeping the market shortage high in line with a tight monetary policy to bear down on excessive bank credit extension and money supply growth . - - Vera von Lieres , Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

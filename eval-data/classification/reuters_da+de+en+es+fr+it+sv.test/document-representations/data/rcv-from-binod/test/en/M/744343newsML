Singapore rubber dull on holidays , looks for leads . Trading in the Singapore rubber market was subdued by midsession on Monday with holidays in Thailand and Japan keeping most people on the sidelines waiting for leads in the afternoon session , dealers said . " We ' re having the holiday blues . It ' s pretty much a quiet market and we haven ' t heard of any strong requests for offers from major consumers this morning . We ' ll just have to wait and see if the afternoon will be better , " a dealer said . The market in Thailand , the world ' s biggest rubber producer , was closed as the country observed a Buddhist holiday while Japan honoured Sea ' s Day . There was no sign yet of fresh buying in the market compared to last week when routine buying by Michelin for RSS3 and a small consignment of TSR20 rubber was seen by the trade . Bridgestone was also said to have bought some TSR20 rubber . " We may not see anything until probably tomorrow when Thailand and Japan reopen , " a dealer said . At around 0430 GMT , September RSS3 was indicated steady at 92 . 00 U . S . cents a kg . September RSS1 was indicated unchanged at 134 . 50 Singapore cents ( 92 U . S . cents ) a kg .

Cosmonauts may avoid fully entering holed module . Cosmonauts aboard the crippled Mir space station may be able to carry out crucial repairs to the holed Spektr module without entering it entirely , a Mission Control official said on Monday . " We have come to the conclusion that the cosmonauts may not have to fully enter the module . It is possible that they could do the work halfway inside Spektr and halfway in the hatch , " deputy flight director Sergei Krikalyov told reporters . He said the date of their sortie had been tentatively set for July 18 but added that there was no need to hurry . " A final date will be fixed later , " Krikalyov said . Earlier on Monday an unmanned cargo craft carrying equipment needed to repair Spektr successfully docked with Mir . The two Russian cosmonauts , Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin , will don heavy spacesuits to reconnect electrical cables and restore some power lost after the last unmanned cargo craft ploughed into the Spektr module on June 25 . The third cosmonaut on board Mir , American Michael Foale , will sit in the escape capsule for safety during the sortie to Spektr , which Krikalyov said could last up to four hours . " We know how to carry out this operation . . . We have concluded that entering the Spektr module is essential . It contains equipment but we do not know what state it is now in , " Krikalyov said . " The cosmonauts have been checking out their spacesuits but have not worked in them yet , " he added . At the weekend Russian and NASA officials in the United States said there had been a mystery leak into space from the holed Spektr module after the collision . Krikalyov said there

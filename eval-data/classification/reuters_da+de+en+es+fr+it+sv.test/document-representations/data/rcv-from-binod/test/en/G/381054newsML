BULGARIA MOVES TO BRIDLE CRISIS BRACES FOR ELECTION . Bulgaria ' s Union of Democratic Forces ( UDF ) braced to win April general elections by becoming a single party while interim cabinet made first steps to contain economic chaos and lay the foundation for recovery . " A new united political force emerged in the past two days which will govern the country after April 19 elections , " UDF leader Ivan Kostov told reporters on Sunday . During a convention , expected to end later on Sunday , the UDF decided to register as a single political party in a bid to adjust its membering parties to the task of governing this crisis - ridden Balkan country . " In its previous shape the UDF could win elections but was unfit for governing the country . . . It would not have been able to cope with the collapsed economy , corrupt administration and rampant organised crime , " said Kostov . " We will need titanic force to save Bulgaria , " he added . The UDF emerged as the favourite to win parliamentary polls after the success of a month - long nation - wide protest campaign which induced the ruling Socialists to agree 12 days ago on early elections , 20 months before the end of their term . President Petar Stoyanov appointed on Wednesday a caretaker cabinet to govern until elections led by Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski . The interim cabinet inherited from the former Socialist administration paralysing fuel shortages , galloping inflation , bread queues , a sinking national currency , enormous debts and large - scale organised crime . " The next several weeks will be crucial . If we contain the crisis now , we have strong chances to stabilise quickly , " Sofianski said in an interview with state television late on Saturday . His immediate priorities included providing adequate fuel and grain supplies , cutting redundant state adiministration , shutting down loss - makers , speeding up sell - offs and gradually lifting price controls . In a bid to curb flight of capital abroad , the interiour ministery banned former Prime Minister Zhan Videnov , his advisors and members his cabinet from travelling abroad until investigations of embezzlement allegations were made . " It is impossible to have a completely devastated state , to have no fuel and no grain supplies , empty coffers and say no one is guilty . . . These people must stay here until the investigation ends , " said Sofianski in the interview . On Friday the government sent troops to enforce border controls in an attempt to curb fuel and food smuggling by motorists to neighbouring Yugoslavia and Macedonia , where prices are higher . " We have to bring prices as close as possible to those in the neighbouring countries , " said Sofianski . A drastic fuel price hike is expected on Monday , as fuel shortages are threatening to paralyse Bulgaria because of insufficient cash to pay for crude supplies . Sofianski saw direct foreign loans as crucial for the country ' s stabilisation . " We have possiblities to receive between $ 300 million and $ 400 million , which will stabilise the situation . Then in June Bulgaria can sharply move forward , " he said . An IMF team is due in Sofia net week to resume talks on the implementation of a fixed exchange rate regime aimed at proping up the national currency and ailing banks . A European Union mission is also expected to come soon .

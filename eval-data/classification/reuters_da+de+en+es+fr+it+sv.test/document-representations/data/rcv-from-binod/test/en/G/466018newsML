Australia hails dazzling Oscar for " Shine " . Australia burst into applause on Tuesday for Oscar - winning actor Geoffrey Rush , a virtual unknown who became the nation ' s latest movie hero for his performance in the film " Shine " . Rush , 45 , won best actor Oscar at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles for his portrayal of mentally - troubled concert pianist David Helfgott , beating off Hollywood heavyweights Tom Cruise and Ralph Fiennes . Arts Minister Richard Alston was lavish in his praise , calling the once - struggling theatre actor ' s achievement a triumph for the country ' s small film industry . He also praised John Seale , a former ranchhand in outback Australia who won the best cinematography award for his work on independent film " The English Patient " . " The success of Geoffrey Rush and John Seale in the Academy Awards is proof positive that Australia now ranks at the very top of the international table in the film industry , " a delighted Alston told reporters in Canberra . " This is a gold medal performance from Geoffrey Rush - - he didn ' t just shine , he dazzled . " Rush became only the second Australian to win the award . Peter Finch , who was born in London but later became a naturalised Australian , won posthumously for " Network " in 1976 . Rush ' s mother , Merle Kiehne , told reporters after watching her son ' s success on television in Brisbane she doubted his surge to the top of the acting profession would change him . " Geoffrey just has a wonderful disposition and a wonderful nature , " she said . " It ' s like a duck to water for Geoffrey . " While seen in Hollywood as an overnight sensation , Rush is highly respected in Australia for his stage work over 25 years . " He is an actor ' s actor , I think , " said Australian Film Commission chairman and producer Sue Milliken . " He is regarded with great affection and respect , " she said . Based on the uplifting true story of concert pianist Helfgott ' s comeback from mental breakdown , " Shine " was made on a budget of around US $ 4 million . Helfgott , who is making a concert tour of the United States to packed audiences but merciless critics , played some of the music from " Shine " at the awards ceremony in Los Angeles . " Shine " was the third Australian film to feature strongly in recent Oscars , following the talking pig " Babe " , and the haunting New Zealand co - production " The Piano " which won three Oscars in 1993 , including best actress and best screenplay . " It ' s incredibly exciting , " Australian Film Institute executive director Ruth Jones told Reuters in Rush ' s home town of Melbourne . " The fact that it ' s a small industry and films are relatively low budget means that we have been able to take a different route , " she said .

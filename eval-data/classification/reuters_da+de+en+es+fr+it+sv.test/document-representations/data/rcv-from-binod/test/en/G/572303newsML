Israel calls U . N . torture report " hypocritical " . Israel on Friday lashed out at the U . N . Committee against Torture for calling on the Jewish state to stop using " torture " in its interrogation of Palestinian detainees . " Israel only uses methods that are employed throughout the world in the war against terrorism , and to single out Israel is hypocritical , " said David Bar - Illan , aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . The committee said the 1987 Convention against Torture , to which Israel is a signatory , ruled out invoking the threat of terrorism as justification for cruel treatment and told Israel to report back on corrective steps taken by September 1 . Bar - Illan said such moves by the committee " sentences to death future innocent victims of terrorism " . Islamic militant suicide bombers have killed scores of Israelis in attacks . Israel ' s Landau Commission on the matter allows for " moderate use of physical pressure " during some interrogations . Nili Arad , director - general of Israel ' s Justice Ministry , said applying the rules of the Landau Commission had helped investigators foil 90 plans for large - scale terrorist attacks . The U . N . committee listed seven interrogation methods which " appear to be applied systematically " and said Israel had neither confirmed nor denied reports of their use . " The committee therefore , must assume them to be accurate , " it said . But the Israeli ambassador to Switzerland , Yosef Lamdan , rejected the committee ' s conclusions , saying they were based on the " hearsay evidence " of non - governmental organisations . " It is absolutely not the case that Israel uses torture or any methods tantamount to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment in interrogating suspected terrorists , " Lamdan said in a statement . " Israel has nothing to hide on this issue . " Amnesty International and other human rights groups who interviewed people interrogated by Israel ' s General Security Services said methods including hooding , sleep deprivation for prolonged periods , violent shaking and even death threats . Peter Burns , a Canadian professor who is the committee ' s rapporteur investigator on Israel , told Reuters : " Individually and in combination the methods constitute torture . Clearly they are cruel and degrading . " Bent Sorensen , a Danish doctor and vice - chairman of the committee , said the conclusions were also based on " medical evidence " contained in autopsy reports as well official Israeli court records showing length of sleep deprivation . " Typical is 46 hours interrogation , two hours rest , then 36 hours interrogation , two hours rest , " he said . Sorensen cited the example of a detainee who died in 1995 during interrogation . His autopsy was seen by professor Dale Pounder , a top forensic expert , who attributed death to brain damage caused by shaking , a controlled method of torture . Burns said that the committee could not accept Israel ' s " defence of necessity " to justify cruel methods . " To avoid this kind of moderate pressure while interrogating terrorists is to ensure the death of scores if not hundreds of innocent civilians , " replied Bar - Illan .

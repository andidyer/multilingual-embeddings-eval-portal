RTRS - FORECAST - Australian interest rates poll - Oct . The Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) Board will meet next Tuesday , October 1 . It will be the first meeting with Ian Macfarlane as Governor , following the retirement of Bernie Fraser in September . Ahead of the board meeting , Reuters surveyed 32 economists on their interest rates outlook , asking three questions . 1 ) Will there be a rate change following the October board meeting ? Yes - 2 50 / 50 - 4 40 / 60 - 4 No - 21One economist preferred not to answer the question . 2 ) What direction will the next move in interest rates most likely be ? Up - 4 Down - 23 Unchanged / down - 3 Unchanged for forseeable future - 1 50 / 50 - 13 ) When will the next rate move take place ? Rise Down mid 97 - 1 Oct 96 - 2 Q3 97 - 1 Oct / Nov 96 - 7 Sep 97 - 1 Nov 96 - 7 Q4 97 - 1 Nov / Dec 96 - 1 Dec 96 - 1 Q4 96 - 5A fourth quarter reduction in official cash rates cut remains economists ' most favoured option . Ten economists saw an October move as likely or a definite possibility . This move was seen most likely to happen either after the labour force data on October 10 , or the release of third quarter inflation and wages data on October 23 and 24 respectively . As such , the RBA Board will give Macfarlane the authority to lower rates if the data falls the right way - weak employment and a high unemployment rate , and continued moderation in both inflation and wages , so a cut next Wednesday is still seen as unlikely . If the cut doesn ' t occur in October , then based on what information available at the moment , a November rate cut is the market ' s most favoured outcome . However , if employment shows strength , and the inflation and wages data disappoint , the outlook could change to rates on hold until the middle of next year , economists said . Recently retired RBA Governor Bernie Fraser ' s description of the July rate cut as insurance is behind some expectations of another cut , with even those expecting a hike as the next move acknowledging the possibility of another cut in 1997 . Economists said it was not clear if insurance meant one cut of 50 basis points as a means to spark the labour market and activity , or whether it meant a total of 100 basis points had been approved , with 50 delivered and 50 held in reserve in case the economy needed a further boost . If a cut has not happened by the end of the year , the odds will start to favour a rise in rates from the middle of next year , they said .

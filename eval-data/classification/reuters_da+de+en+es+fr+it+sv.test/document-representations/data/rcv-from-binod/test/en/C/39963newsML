News Corp ' s Star stalks Hindi market . The big cat of the media world , Rupert Murdoch ' s News Corp , has moved closer to sinking its teeth deeper into India ' s vast Hindi and regional language television audience , analysts said at the weekend . The government announced on Friday approval for an $ 11 million direct foreign investment for News Television India Private Ltd ( NTVI ) , a News Corp affiliate . While this represents little in money terms , clearance for NTVI effectively to operate as an Indian company will send shudders through domestic broadcasters , the sources said . " He ( Murdoch ) is trying to push aggressively into the market through this move , " Ashish Bhatnagar , media analyst for Bombay brokerage SS Kantilal Ishwarlal Securities ( SSKI ) , told Reuters . India ' s television industry currently is dominated by state - owned Doordarshan , with access to more than 70 million homes in a nation with an estimated population of 930 million people . Independent industry consultant Iqbal Malhotra described Friday ' s news as a victory for Murdoch that would probably annoy domestic operators . " It gives NTVI carte blanche to operate in India , " Malhotra said , adding that NTVI ' s next step could be to apply to become an Indian broadcaster . News Corp ' s Hong Kong - based subsidiary , Star TV , owns 40 percent of NTVI . The rest is owned by a Mauritius - based offshore company International Graphics Holdings , which has the advantage of being headed by a Non - Resident Indian ( NRI ) . NTVI is a production house and an advertising sales agent effectively managing Star ' s interests in India . If NTVI applies to become a broadcaster , and if the law changes to allow links to satellites from Indian soil - - currently prohibited - - Star will be better placed than any rivals to beam in on the direct - to - home market across India . A senior Star offical in Bombay refused to comment on the new status of NTVI . Industry sources say domestic broadcasters are concerned over foreign entry into the market in an apparent attempt to protect their advertising revenues . They said Star might consider satellite links to broadcast live news and sports out of India if the laws changed . The domestic political lobby against foreign media involvement in India is strong as the government pushes ahead with economic liberalisation . But it has already stalled a bid by Pearson Plc , the owners of the Financial Times , to form a joint venture with an Indian newspaper . There was immediate media speculation after a meeting in June between Murdoch and then newly - appointed Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda that the press baron had smoothed the path for Star ' s ambitions . " I think Mr Rupert Murdoch has a long term plan for India , " said SSKI ' s Bhatnagar . Four Star channels are currently broadcast in India via cable link to the major cities . Now , there is speculation that Star plans to transform programming of the Star Plus channel in India to appeal to the Hindi - language market . But cable is an expensive method of delivery . Setting up access to the vast market outside the major cities via satellite could provide Star with the crown for some badly needed jewels . News Corp needs to turnaround loss - maker Star ' s fortunes . In the year to June 30 Star increased revenues by 35 percent but its operating losses were estimated at around $ 80 million as it continued to regionalise its programming and push into Japan . The Indian market has been identified as a prime target for growth . At stake is India ' s annual spending on television advertising of $ 350 million , said Malhotra . Other independent forecasts say that figure could rise close to $ 1 . 0 billion by the year 2000 . Malhotra estimated Star ' s current share at less than seven percent .

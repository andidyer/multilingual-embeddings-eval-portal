Top aide to Japan PM wants to step down - - report . The key figure in Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ' s cabinet asked on Friday to be relieved of his post after a cabinet reshuffle expected next month , Kyodo news agency reported . Seiroku Kajiyama , chief cabinet secretary and Hashimoto ' s top aide in the 20 - member cabinet , told the prime minister personally he wanted to quit , Kyodo said . Hashimoto replied " I cannot hear you " , indicating he would persuade Kajiyama to stay on in his job , Kyodo said . It was not clear if Kajiyama would actually step down , but political analysts said his move was part of a fierce tug - of - war between rival wings of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . Kajiyama ' s conservative LDP wing favours an alliance with the main opposition Shinshinto ( New Frontier Party ) , while its rival liberal wing , led by LDP secretary - general Koichi Kato , wants to keep the LDP in the current alliance with the Social Democrats and the tiny Sakigake party . Parliamentary sources and analysts said Kajiyama ' s refusal to continue as chief cabinet secretary would force Kato to follow suit and step down as LDP secretary - general , the number two post in the party after that of president . This is because Kajiyama ' s appointment as chief cabinet secretary in January 1996 was part of a balancing act by Hashimoto that also placed Kato in the post of secretary - general . In effect the second strongest post in the cabinet , the chief cabinet secretary oversees all other cabinet members , coordinates government policy in general and speaks as the top government spokesman . Hashimoto is expected to be re - elected to a second two - year term as LDP president on September 8 , a party post which carries with it the premiership because of the party ' s strength in parliament . Party officials say no one is likely to contest Hashimoto ' s bid for a second term . Hashimoto is widely expected to reshuffle his cabinet after the event . Ever since the demise of the LDP ' s two smaller allies in the October 1996 general elections , the LDP has been caught in a fierce rivalry between those who want a so - called " conservative - conservative " alliance with the Shinshinto and those who oppose the move .

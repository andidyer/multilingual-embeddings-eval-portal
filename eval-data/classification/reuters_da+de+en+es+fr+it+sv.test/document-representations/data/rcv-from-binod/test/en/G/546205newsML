Busy City bookmakers mark UK ' s Labour down a touch . Gambling - crazy London traders on Tuesday defied a new opinion poll predicting a landslide victory for the opposition Labour party in Thursday ' s British election . Financial bookmakers reported a slight drop in Labour ' s predicted majority after the City of London ' s traditionally Conservative - supporting traders on Monday bought the majority up to its highest level in the six - week election campaign . " It ' s settled down a bit after the frenzy yesterday , " said Paul Barnett , political market maker at City Index . But business had remained brisk , he said . The financial bookmakers take so - called " spread bets " from traders hungry for high - risk , complex gambles . City Index quoted Labour ' s majority at a bid / offer spread of 95 - 105 on Tuesday , meaning a punter expecting the winning margin to exceed that would go ' long ' at 105 . That spread hit highs of around 102 - 112 on Monday , City Index said . Labour was projected to win 376 - 382 seats , with the Conservatives - - in power since 1979 - - on 221 - 227 . At IG Index , the Labour majority was quoted at 98 - 108 seats for a total of 378 - 384 , versus the Conservatives ' 220 - 226 . The latest opinion poll , issued by Gallup for Tuesday ' s Daily Telegraph , gave Labour a 22 percentage - point lead over the Conservatives , which would translate into a 265 - seat majority in the 659 - seat parliament . But City ' s Barnett said memories remained vivid of the pollsters ' similar predictions - - proved spectacularly wrong - - of a big Labour win at the last parliamentary election in 1992 . " We ' re seeing two camps : people who believe the polls religiously , and those who think they ' ll be massively wrong , like the last election .

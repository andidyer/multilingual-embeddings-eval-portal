Rome wants to commmorate WWII Istria dead . Rome ' s city council wants to honour Italians killed by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito ' s communists in Italian fascist - ruled Istria during World War Two by naming a street after the victims , newspapers said on Sunday . " I think the time has come to look more courageously at our history , " said Piero Sandulli , the head of the place names department at the council . " I think we need to remember the tragic events of the reprisals against Italians in Istria in 1943 - 44 which brought together fascist leaders and innocent victims in the same fate . " The Istrian peninsula was ceded to Italy after the collapse of the Austro - Hungarian empire at the end of World War One . But Italy was forced to hand it over to Yugoslavia in 1947 after the defeat of fascism in World War Two and Istria now is divided between Slovenia and Croatia . At least 150 , 000 Italians fled from Istria and Dalmatia , which was occupied by Italy in the war and now is in Croatia , or were expelled by Tito and had their property confiscated . Thousands killed during the explusion were tossed into the " foibe " - - natural underground caverns typical to the region . A lingering dispute between Italy and Slovenia about confiscated property held up Slovenia ' s application to join the European Union and some far - right ministers have argued in recent years that Italy has a historic claim to the area . Sandulli said the plan to name a street or square after the " foibe " victims would be considered as soon as possible . But a councillor from the ex - communist Democratic Party of the Left was unimpressed . Victor Magiar said he was still waiting for Rome to get around to naming streets after South African anti - apartheid hero Steve Biko , Italian author Primo Levi and assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin as it has already promised .

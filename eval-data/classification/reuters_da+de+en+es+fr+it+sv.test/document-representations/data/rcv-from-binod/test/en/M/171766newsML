Most US stock index futures close slightly higher . Most U . S . stock index futures closed slightly higher , with December Standard & Poor ' s 500s ending at a new settlement high due to a late rally in the U . S . bond market , traders and analysts said . Yields on the 30 - year T - bond fell to 6 . 54 percent , increasing the attractiveness of the stock market ' s real rate of return , they said . Floor traders said buying was heavy at the close of pit trade , and would probably continue during GLOBEX . " We really see this range expanding on the upside , " one floor trader said . He is looking for December to rise to 735 . 00 in the near future . As on Wednesday , December S & Ps set a contract high in the afternoon after the U . S . bond futures market closed at 1400 CST / 2000 GMT . The U . S . bond market ' s rally after the positive 30 - year bond auction paved the way for S & Ps to resume their upward trend , and delayed a much - needed correction , some traders said . Unlike Wednesday , the contract did not set a string of all - time highs , as activity did not ignite into the fierce buying frenzy seen in the last hour of Wednesday ' s pit trade . Volume was heavy , with total S & P futures volume estimated at 81 , 000 . Traders said arbitrage buy programs were hit at a premium of 4 . 00 points to cash . " We ' re as fat as a slaughtered hog , " one floor trader said about the futures market ' s rich premium to cash . For most of the day , December S & Ps traded above fair value at 2 . 67 to 2 . 70 points . Nikkei futures remained lower , as the market still gripped onto bearish dollar / yen comments made to a Japanese newspaper by Eisuke Sakakibara , a key Finance Ministry official . Sakakibara was quoted as saying that the dollar ' s upward correction against the yen was about over . While the U . S . dollar rallied against the yen in late U . S . dealings , Nikkei futures had little response to the appreciating dollar . Speculation grew in the currency market that U . S . Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin would deliver a forceful statement reiterating the U . S . desire for a strong dollar . At the end of pit trade , December S & Ps were 1 . 55 higher at 730 . 95 , Nikkei 225s fell 370 . 0 to 20 , 890 . 0 , Midcap 400s were down 0 . 15 at 249 . 40 , Nasdaq 100s were up 6 . 00 at 799 . 75 , New Composites were up 0 . 30 at 386 . 45 , and KBT Value Lines were 1 . 00 lower at 659 . 70 . - Derivatives desk 312 - 408 - 8750 ; E - mail derivatives @ reuters . com

S . Korean petrol price rise by two pct - industry . Petrol prices at most South Korean pumps rose an average of two percent to 848 won on Saturday from the previous level of 829 won , oil industry officials said . Kerosene prices increased to 397 won a litre from 387 - 388 won and diesel prices rose to 383 won from 382 . Yukong Ltd , LG - Caltex Corp and Hanwha Energy Co Ltd , which control about 80 percent of the local market , said the raise was inevitable considering the rise in crude oil price and the won ' s fall against the dollar . Hyundai Oil Refinery Co and Ssangyong Oil Refining Co have yet to increase prices , the officials said . Domestic prices of gasoline , kerosene , diesel and C - type fuel were deregulated on January 1 and they are no longer subject to a government - set monthly price ceiling . The new regime is part of a wider deregulation of oil product imports and exports , loosening the grip of refineries on oil trade . Until the end of June , oil refiners must give the government advance notice of price changes on gasoline , kerosene and diesel . After that notification could be made after implementing changes . But the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy said it would intervene if prices became too volatile and endangered the stability of the economy . Refiners found guilty of setting prices far below market value to increase their market shares would be punished according to the Fair Trade Act , ministry officials said . - - Seoul Newsroom ( 822 ) 727 5643

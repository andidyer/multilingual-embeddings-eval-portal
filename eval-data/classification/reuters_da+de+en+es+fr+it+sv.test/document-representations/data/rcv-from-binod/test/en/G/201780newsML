Belgian deputy PM faces child sex investigation . Prosecutors have asked parliamentary party leaders to approve the investigation of one of Belgium ' s top politicians in a possible child sex scandal . Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo , fiercely denying involvment in paedophilia , says he wants his parliamentary immunity lifted so he can fight the charges head - on . But the allegations and reports of other unrelated scandal are affecting financial markets , weighing on the Belgian franc and putting fresh pressure on a government that has suffered a series of damaging shocks in the past three months . Di Rupo said in the statement on Monday that filing a charge against him by prosecutors - - a relatively early step in the investigation , needed before police can question him - - would allow him to see the file against him and defend himself . " I hope this confusion , these mix - ups and fabrications can be stopped - - that is essential , " he said . " I wish to reaffirm that I have never had anything at all to do with paedophilia . No action in my private life has ever harmed anybody . " Di Rupo is one of five members of centre - left Prime Minister Jean - Luc Dehaene ' s inner cabinet . He is also minister of economics and telecommunications , so his responsibilities include Belgium ' s fight against child porn on the Internet . Di Rupo said on Monday that some members of the opposition were trying to make political capital from press allegations that he had sex with under - age boys . The faith of Belgians in their political and legal system has been undermined by a shocking series of child abductions , sex abuse and killings which came to light in August , and by another case which disclosed judicial dithering over the unsolved assassination of a socialist politician in 1991 . The media say they have a duty to expose , but politicians feel they face a witch hunt in which rumour is published as fact and suspicion is sufficient to ruin a career . Child sex allegations are far from the only issue . Agriculture Minister Karel Pinxten has denied accusation of tax evasion and influence peddling which come from a semi - independent body set up to fight white - collar crime in the public sector . And Prime Minister Dehaene felt obliged to issue a statement on Monday denying a separate press report that he too had been involved in influence peddling . The last time heads rolled in a Belgian political scandal was in 1994 when the issue was party financing . It cost four ministers their jobs and Willy Claes , a former economics minister , resigned as NATO secretary general . Analysts said the government was not yet threatened . " We are sitting on a time - bomb , but Belgian politicians have proved themselves extremely clever in the past at defusing time - bombs , " Lieven De Winter , professor of Political Science at the Catholic University of Louvain , told Reuters . " I don ' t think the government will resign although certain individuals may have to . But these are replaceable , " he added .

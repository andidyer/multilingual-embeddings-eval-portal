Cricket - Early wickets for England vs NZ A . New Zealand A were struggling on the first morning of their four - day cricket match against England at Victoria Park on Thursday . The early New Zealand A batsmen struggled against England ' s new ball bowlers after captain Darrin Murray won the toss and elected to bat on a green , seaming pitch . Former test opener Craig Spearman didn ' t even last through the first over . He drove at the fifth ball from fast - medium Chris Silverwood , didn ' t get his foot to the ball and sliced an easy catch to Nasser Hussain at point . Silverwood picked up his second wicket in the seventh over when lefthander Phil Chandler pushed half forward and was leg before wicket for three . That left New Zealand A at 12 for two wickets but Murray , who had opened the innings with Spearman , and Matt Horne put some substance into the innings . They both picked up boundaries to third man and when allrounder Craig White overpitched in his first over , Horne drove him for four to mid off and three to cover in the same over . Silverwood had the figures of 2 - 20 from seven overs while Andrew Caddick , who beat both Murray and Horne , had 0 - 21 off six overs . White ' s first over cost seven runs and after 14 overs New Zealand A were 48 - 2 , Murray on 22 and Horne on 23 .

FOCUS - Celltech drug failure rocks biotechs . The surprise failure of a Celltech Group Plc drug sent shock waves through the biotech sector on Wednesday as investors were rudely reminded of the risky nature of their investments . Celltech ' s value more than halved in a matter of minutes after its German partner Bayer AG said late - stage trials in the U . S . had shown that a joint drug for septic shock failed to prevent deaths . At one point the company , which closed on Tuesday with a market capitalisation of 476 million pounds ( $ 787 . 7 million ) , saw 276 million pounds wiped off its value . The shares fell from 630 pence to a low of 265 pence , before struggling back to 330 pence in mid - afternoon trading . " It is a big setback and it has sent a shock wave through the sector , " one senior dealer said . " It will make institutions very wary of holding biotech stocks . This was a major stock in the sector that has attracted some funds because it was in the ( FT - SE ) 250 index and was more liquid than most . But people should remember that things can go wrong . " Fallout from the announcement was felt widely , provoking initial sharp falls in sector leaders such as British Biotech Plc , Chiroscience Group Plc and Scotia Holdings Plc . " Clearly this has reminded people of the risks involved with these biopharmaceutical companies that are reliant on these types of drugs , " said Merrill Lynch analyst Nigel Barnes . But Barnes said a knee - jerk reaction had been tempered during the day as investors looked more closely at relative risks involved . By mid - afternoon British Biotech was down 2 1 / 2 pence at 256 after a low of 235 , Chiroscience was down 2 at 292 1 / 2 after a low of 250 pence , Scotia slipped 10 to 395 after falling to 360 and Cantab Pharmaceuticals was off 47 1 / 2 pence to 955 after a low of 835 pence . Celltech had enjoyed a robust year on the back of growing optimism about BAYX - 1351 , a drug to treat the frequently fatal poisoning which can attack the body after surgery or other traumas such as accidents . Bayer had made increasingly optimistic noises about the potential for the product after intermediate - stage trials showed a marked improvement in mortality rates . Septic shock kills up to half of those its attacks . But on Tuesday the company informed Celltech that a massive and costly study involving 1 , 850 patients in the U . S . had shown no significant improvement in survival rates , consigning BAYX - 1351 to the growing pile of failed attempts at tackling the condition . Celltech finance director Peter Allen told Reuters the bombshell would set back the group ' s move to sustained profitability by two years . It also knocked on the head hopes for a follow - up septic shock drug in which Celltech had a much bigger stake . The group said it would now focus on drugs for Crohn ' s disease , a poorly - treated condition affecting the lower intestine , acute leukaemia and psoriasis . Fellner expressed surprise at the scale of the share price fall , a view shared by some analysts . In a note on the sector Henry Cooke Lumsden analyst Tom Geimer said the shares could drop to 400 pence if the septic shock drug failed . But he said even this level would " seriously undervalue the company , which has a lot more in the pipeline than a treatment for septic shock . This scenario of failure would represent a strong buying opportunity . " Analysts Greig Middleton said late last month that even without septic shock , Celltech had a fair value of 530 pence rising to 695 pence by January 1998 . Celltech , which was founded with government funding in the early 1980s , has had a rocky history . Chief executive Peter Fellner , formerly head of Roche UK , is widely attributed with turning the company round and focusing its scattered energies on a pipeline of potential money - spinning drugs . Other recent setbacks include Merck ' s decision in February 1996 to drop an asthma compound because it didn ' t have blockbuster potential . And there has been disappointment over a severe allergic asthma drug being developed with Schering Plough Corp , which has been repeatedly delayed over safety concerns .

Kurd leader plays Baghdad card before U . S . talks . Iraqi Kurdish faction leader Massoud Barzani has raised the stakes of a U . S . peace bid in northern Iraq by threatening to call for Baghdad ' s help in an inter - Kurdish conflict . Barzani , who allied himself with Iraqi forces in August , said he might ask President Saddam Hussein ' s forces to come to his aid once more to curtail a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) offensive . " If the Kurdish people are under hard pressure of the PUK , " we will ask for help from Iraq , " Barzani told a news conference on Thursday near the northern town of Salahuddin . He did not specify how Baghdad could back him . Barzani is due to meet Robert Pelletreau , U . S . assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , in Turkey on Friday or Saturday for talks on ending the Kurdish feud . The two met in Ankara after Barzani fought beside Iraqi armoured troops to take the key city of Arbil six weeks ago . Barzani had promised Washington that the deal with Baghdad was a once - off alliance . In reprisal for Iraqi troops intervening in northern Iraq - - essentially off - limits to Baghdad since the 1991 Gulf War - - the United States fired missiles at targets in south Iraq . Barzani ' s Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) has now lost most of the ground it took from the PUK in last month ' s offensive , which gave the KDP control over the whole Kurdish region . Arbil , the seat of a now defunct Kurdish regional parliament in which both parties held an equal number of seats , is one of the few main centres holding out against the PUK , led by Jalal Talabani . Barzani repeated accusations that Iran was backing Talabani . But the threat to call in Saddam seemed to have more to do with the U . S . talks than the reality on the ground in the mountains of northern Iraq . There has been no sign of Iranian or Iraqi forces on either side of the Kurdish militias ' lines in much of the region this week . And Talabani says he is not interested in taking Arbil in the meantime . " Not now , " he told Reuters Television . " At the moment we are avoiding any kind of clashes and difficulties with the central government , " said Talabani , who added that Iraqi tanks were positioned in or near the city of around 800 , 000 people . The PUK has massed guerrillas 70 ( 45 miles ) north of Arbil and others 30 ( 20 miles ) to the south of the city but they have advanced little in the last 24 hours . U . S . Defence Secretary William Perry said he was monitoring reports of Iraqi Republican Guard troop movements to the north . " We are watching that very , very closely . The evidence to this point is inconclusive , " Perry said in Moscow . " Nothing that has happened so far would suggest to me that they ( U . S . military forces ) would need to be used . "

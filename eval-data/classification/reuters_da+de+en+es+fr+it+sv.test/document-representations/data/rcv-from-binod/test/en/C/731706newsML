MCI denies profit warning a political move . MCI Communications Corp denied on Wednesday that a surprise profit warning last week was a political move to force U . S . regulators to open up domestic markets more quickly . MCI said last Thursday it expected to post significantly higher than forecast losses because of problems breaking into local U . S . markets . The statement rocked a planned $ 20 billion merger with British Telecommunications Plc . " It would have been a whole lot easier to have gone out and placed an advertisement - - and less painful , " an MCI spokeswoman said after an annual meeting of BT shareholders in Edinburgh . MCI says regulatory restraints and footdragging by local monopoly telecom companies are preventing it from breaking into the $ 100 billion U . S . local markets . Some analysts say MCI might be exaggerating the estimated investment needed and losses expected from its local business . Other analysts believe the bearish MCI forecast may point to problems with MCI core long - distance business . Salomon Brothers says that BT knew about MCI ' s plans for breaking into local markets and backed its efforts to dramatically highlight the footdragging by local operators . BT backs MCI ' s call for effective action by regulators but has said it plans a thorough review of MCI ' s strategy following the U . S . group ' s surprise statement . Few analysts think the merger , which will be the largest trans - Atlantic deal in history if passed by U . S . regulators , is likely to fall apart but BT may decide to renegotiate the terms . MCI shareholders have been keen to point out that not all the news from BT has been good . BT has been hit by a 500 million stg windfall tax on the earnings . BT ' s contributions to its pension fund also have to be raised considerably after tax changes , MCI shareholders have said . MCI chairman Bert Roberts will be returning to Washington on Wednesday or Thursday but Jerry Taylor , the company ' s chief executive who also attended the meeting in Edinburgh , is likely to stay in Europe for the time being , the MCI spokeswoman said . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4017

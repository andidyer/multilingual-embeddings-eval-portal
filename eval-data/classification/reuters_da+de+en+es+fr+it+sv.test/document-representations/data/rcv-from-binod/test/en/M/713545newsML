U . S . cash crudes - LLS , sour edge up at front end . U . S . cash crude prices were unchanged to a few cents stronger early Tuesday , with traders expecting the Iraq oil exports to move a step closer and awaiting the weekly American Petroleum Institute report . Outright crude futures prices for benchmark West Texas Intermediate ( WTI / Cushing ) traded a narrow range during the early session and were in the middle of that range at $ 19 . 57 , up five cents , just before noon . The exchange for physical ( efp ) premium was around three cents and the August / September roll was steady at around 9 / 10 cents contango . The United Nations coordinator in Baghdad said early Tuesday that he would meet with Iraqi government officials and expected to receive an aid procurement and distribution plan by around 2000 GMT . The plan must be delivered and okayed by the U . N . secretary - general before oil exports under the " oil - for - food " scheme can start again . Iraq had exported around 660 , 000 barrels per day of its crude from December 10 to June 7 under the deal and was given permission to export for another 180 days from June 8 . " There will be plenty of supply when Iraq comes back but not for at least 30 days ( into the U . S . Gulf ) , " said a trader for a firm specializing in crude arbitrage . " The market is in contango right now but I don ' t think that ' s going to last , " he added . The absence of Iraqi crude has helped push up the sour differential against WTI from $ 1 . 70 / $ 1 . 75 discount in early June to as low as 80 cents , before drifting back to around $ 1 . 15 - the level of Monday ' s trade . " It ' s a stalemate in that range right now , " said a trader for a major oil company dealing in sours . " There have been a few people trying to drive it out but they haven ' t been successful . " The catfeed prices and gasoline prices have been rising in Gulf recently , reflecting a shortage of feed barrels from Coastal ' s big Aruba refinery . Coastal had been lifting 80 , 000 bpd of Iraqi crude before June 7 . " They ' ve been eating into inventory and it ' s starting to get very tight , " said the arbitrager . Light Lousiana Sweet / St . James also remained firm early Tuesday , with a trade at 20 cents over WTI . That market is helped by a tight Brent market and an absence of any shipping fixtures in the near future , though trades also see the situation reversing in September . LLS was quoted at 28 / 29 just before noon . " There are people offering Brents but the levels don ' t work , " said one trader . The WTI / Brent spread has moved back over the last two weeks from below a $ 1 to above $ 1 . 30 but still is a bit expensive for the Gulf , he added . Among other grades , Midland was unchanged at - 30 / 28 to WTI , Eugene was still seeing minimal initerest at $ - 1 . 30 offered . - - Tony McAuley , New York Energy Desk ( ( + 1 212 859 1623 ) )

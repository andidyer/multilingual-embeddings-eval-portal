Lufthansa drops prices for May weekend . German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it was dropping prices on a number of its domestic routes to 150 marks for the first weekend in May , a tradional short break for many Germans . Lufthansa announced only in February it was cutting fares on domestic routes - - on which it says it makes no profit - - to as low as 222 marks , a move that was immediately followed by price cuts from one of its main rivals , Deutsche BA . The new Lufthansa offer applies to a number of German destinations out of Berlin , Duesseldorf , Dresden , Hamburg , Hanover , Cologne / Bonn , Munich and Stuttgart . The offer does not apply to flights out of Frankfurt , from which Deutsche BA does not offer domestic German flights . - - Frankffurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525

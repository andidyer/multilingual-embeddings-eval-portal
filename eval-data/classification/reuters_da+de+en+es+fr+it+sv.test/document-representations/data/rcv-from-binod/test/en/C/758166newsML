Aetna names Richard Huber president , CEO . Aetna Inc . said Friday it named Richard Huber president and chief executive officer . Huber , 60 , has been vice chairman of strategy and finance and a member of Aetna ' s board of directors . He is widely credited by industry analysts as the strategic mastermind behind the 144 - year - old company ' s massive restructuring last year . The Hartford , Conn . - based insurance giant underwent a major overhaul with the $ 4 . 1 billion sale of its property - casualty business to Travelers Group in April 1996 and its $ 8 . 9 billion merger with U . S . Healthcare last July . Ronald Compton will remain chairman of the Hartford , Conn . - based managed care and life insurer until his planned retirement date , which is at the end of February 1998 . The board has not yet named a replacement for Compton as chairman , Aetna said . Huber ' s appointment as president and chief executive will be effective Monday , Aetna said . Huber said in an interview that the company ' s three businesses - - Aetna U . S . Healthcare , Aetna Retirement Services and Aetna International - - are all on the right path for sustained growth in the next few years . " We have three fabulous businesses , all of which have highly positive demographics working in our favour , " he said . " The No . 1 objective is not to lose the tremendous momentum that we ' ve built up in the last year or so . " He said the company was proud that its stock price had appreciated to $ 115 Thursday from $ 46 at the beginning of 1995 . Aetna ' s market capitalisation rose to $ 17 billion from $ 5 billion over the same period , he said . Aetna rose $ 2 . 44 to $ 112 . 625 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday . Industry analysts said Huber ' s ascension was a positive , and that it was generally expected . " If anything , this is a positive because it removes the uncertainty associated with trying to pick someone , " said Joe France , analyst at CS First Boston . Analysts said Huber ' s promotion became all the more likely after the surprise resignation May 16 of former President Joseph Sebastianelli , who had been co - president of U . S . Healthcare before the merger . " Sebastianelli was the obvious heir apparent , " said Ira Zuckerman , analyst at Nutmeg Securities . Analysts noted that Huber did not share Sebastianelli ' s health care background . " I wouldn ' t say it ' s a serious ( handicap ) , but it ' s something that , to some degree , you have to be concerned about , " Zuckerman said , adding that health care " is now the tail wagging the dog on Aetna . " Huber , who joined Aetna in February 1995 from the banking industry , said his relative unfamiliarity with healthcare was not a problem . " As ( General Electric Co . Chairman ) Jack Welch frequently says , he has difficulty making jet engines himself , " Huber said . " I ' ve been heavily involved in the strategy , in the decision to make the U . S . Healthcare acquisition , I was the senior member of the integration team . I was the interim head of Aetna Health Plans . . . " " I ' m not going to be out there giving prescriptions , but I think I know the dynamics of the business , and we have a very strong team that ' s going to be on the ground actually doing the day to day work .

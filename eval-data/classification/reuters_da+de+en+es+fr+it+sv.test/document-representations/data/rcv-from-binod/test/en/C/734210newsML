Hills eyes M2 toll price restructure . Motorway operator Hills Motorway Ltd said on Wednesday it was considering offering a reduced toll for motorists using only part of its new M2 motorway in Sydney after early signs some were choosing to bypass the motorway . " Rather than have a flat A $ 2 . 50 toll , there could a reduction for entry at other entrances along the way , " Hills Chairman Stanley Howard told Reuters . " That ' s something that could be under consideration , " he said . He said Hills was not considering cutting the A $ 2 . 50 toll for complete motorway journeys . Hills announced on Tuesday data showing average daily traffic in June of 39 , 801 vehicles . June was the motorway ' s first full month of operation . The 39 , 801 compares with a forecast of average daily traffic of 72 , 000 by the end of 1998 in Hills ' 1994 prospectus . Howard said it was far too early to tell if the motorway was performing above or below expectations . The traffic volumes compared favourably with the initial traffic levels seen when Sydney ' s M4 and M5 were opened , he said . " For every motorway in the world , there is a ramp up period and it varies from tollway to tollway , " he said . " It could be a few months before we can estimate any particular pattern , " he said . Earlier , Hills responded to an Australian Stock Exchange ( ASX ) query about release of the information and said it had not breached continuous disclosure rules . Hills ' shares were down 12 cents at A $ 1 . 98 at 11 . 53 a . m . ( 0153 GMT ) to its lowest point since March 24 , having fallen eight cents on Tuesday . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

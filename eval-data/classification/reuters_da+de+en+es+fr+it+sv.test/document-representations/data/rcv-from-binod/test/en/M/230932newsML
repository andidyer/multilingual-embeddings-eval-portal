Chile blue chips end firmer in technical rebound . Chilean blue chips closed broadly higher in a mild technical rebound after Monday ' s heavy losses , said traders . The bolsa is expected to hold steady at the opening , although the undertone remains weak , said Pablo Salcedo , head of research at brokerage ING Barings . " The market will continue to fall unless people realise stocks are cheap and start buying , " said Salcedo . " But , really , I don ' t see any upside in the short - term . " The 40 - share IPSA index ended unofficially up 0 . 17 percent at 91 . 57 points . The general IGPA index slipped 0 . 04 percent to 5 , 032 points . Turnover swelled to 12 . 7 billion pesos from 10 billion pesos on Monday . Salcedo said the bourse could recover towards the end of the month if the cash - rich pension funds decide to move into the market to take advantage of the cheap prices . " One thing which could support the market is massive buying by pension funds , " he said . " They could easily start buying now and push the market up significantly . " Electricity stocks closed mixed , but Endesa , Chile ' s largest hydro - electric generator , continued to retreat on fears this year ' s drought will seriously hurt earnings , said traders . Endesa ended off 1 . 01 percent at 220 - 3 / 4 pesos . Enersis firmed 0 . 88 percent to 230 pesos . Other losers included glass - maker Cristales , down 3 . 45 percent at 2 , 515 pesos , and forestry firm Masisa which shed 1 . 35 percent to 183 pesos . Winners included Banco O ' Higgins , up 1 . 61 percent at 1 , 580 pesos and drug - maker LabChile , which rose 1 . 43 percent at 355 pesos . - - Margaret Orgill , Santiago newsroom , 562 - 699 - 5595x212

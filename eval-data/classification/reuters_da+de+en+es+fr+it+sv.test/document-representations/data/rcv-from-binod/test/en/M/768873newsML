Hungary Forex Club may launch one - year BUBOR rate . The Hungarian Forex Club ( MFT ) is considering the introduction of a twelve - month Budapest Interbank Offered Rate , the MFT said on Thursday . MFT launched the one - month and the three - month BUBOR rates on August 1 , 1996 , and added the six - month rate in May as six - month loans on the interbank market became liquid enough , MFT officials told a news conference . The BUBOR rates are calculated by the National Bank of Hungary daily from the average quotes of eight banks . The maturity for which Hungarian banks deal with each other on the interbank market have been lengthening in the past year as the central banks ' monetary policies made financial market processes more calculable , they added . The MFT is considering launching a one - year BUBOR rate as one - year loans have appeared on the interbank market . " We have already seen offers for one year on the money market and they did not move in a very wide range , " said Geza Egyed , chairman of MFT ' s BUBOR committee . However , he added it would probably take more than a few months for one - year money market deals to become liquid enough to make the introduction of one - year BUBOR rates reasonable . MFT operative committee chairman Judit Teschler said that a BUBOR rate for less than one - month maturity may also be introduced . She added that the banks quoting BUBOR rates undertook to do deals for minimum 100 million forints at the bids and offers they quote , but the Club was also considering raising the minimum amount by 100 - 400 million forints . Egyed said BUBOR futures turnover on the Budapest Stock Exchange has totalled 118 billion forints since September when the bourse launched the instrument . The BUBOR has become the basis of Forward Rate Agreements ( FRAs ) , which also appeared in September on Hungary ' s interbank market and their total turnover has reached 50 to 60 billion forints so far , Egyed said . Hungary ' s BUBOR rates did not change on Thursday . The one - month rate was fixed at 20 . 50 percent , the three - month rate at 20 . 11 percent and the six - month BUBOR at 19 . 74 percent . - - Sandor Peto , Budapest newsroom ( 36 1 ) 327 4040

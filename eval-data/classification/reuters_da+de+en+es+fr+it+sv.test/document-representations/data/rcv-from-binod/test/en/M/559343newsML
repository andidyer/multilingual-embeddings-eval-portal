Czech PX50 tumbles led by major issues . Czech shares continued to slide on Monday with analysts seeing little interest from abroad because of worries about company profits and the prospects for the economy as a whole . " I can ' t see any reason , macro or micro , why investors should put money into the Czech Republic , " ABN - AMRO Hoare Govett ' s Eugene Klerk told Reuters . The PX50 dropped by just over one percent to 522 while the major issue dominated RPIX index fell 1 . 7 percent to 1 , 072 . 5 . The biggest decliner among the highly capitalised shares was Komercni Banka which fell 94 crowns , 4 . 3 percent , to 2 , 072 . ABN AMRO Hoare Govett recently downgraded their recommendation for Komercni to " hold " from " buy " citing as reasons the general macroecnomic situation and falling profits in the first quarter of the year . Last week , Komercni posted pre - tax profits of one billion crowns for the first quarter from 1 . 3 billion in the same period in 1996 according to international accounting standards .

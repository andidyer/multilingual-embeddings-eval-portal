British retail chain breaking up , CEO quits . British retailer Sears Plc on Tuesday announced the breakup of its corporate empire , including the spin - off of upscale department store Selfridges , to try to improve returns for its long - suffering shareholders . The retailer , hit by long - running problems from its shoe business , also announced the departure of its beleaguered chief executive , Liam Strong . Strong had come under attack for failing to turn around the group ' s performance after five years in the job . Sears unveiled the long - awaited shake - up as it announced 1996 annual results and the sale of its Freemans mail order business to Littlewoods for 367 . 5 million pounds ( $ 597 million ) , along with plans to hand the proceeds to shareholders . The restructuring of Sears aims to ditch its money - losing British Shoe Corp . , leaving women ' s and children ' s wear chains plus Selfridges , its star earner . The announcement ended months of speculation about a breakup and the fate of Strong , whose failure to revive the business had tried the patience of institutional shareholders . He was hired to inject new life into the far - flung Sears retail empire but failed to do so despite a retail boom . Chairman Sir Bob Reid said the restructuring would secure Sears ' future . " We ' ve pruned the roses . When you prune the roses , you get good blooms , super growth , " he told Reuters by telephone . Sears has appointed David James as executive chairman of BSC to oversee its restructuring . " Company doctor " James , with a reputation for sorting out troubled firms , will look at each of the shoe businesses and see what their value is in the open market , mulling the advantages of holding on to them or selling them . Reid said it was too early to say what the cost might be to Sears of the restructruing , commenting : " We would deal with the provisions when we ' ve actually gone through the shoe businesses one by one . " He declined to make any predictions on job cuts which might follow the restructuring . He said Sears wanted to complete the restructuring by the end of this year . There were several companies interested in BSC , he said , including U . S . shoe retailers Nine West Group Inc . and Payless Shoesource Inc . . Reid said the Selfridges spin - off would go ahead around the middle of next year and described recent estimates valuing Selfridges at around 600 million pounds ( $ 975 million ) as conservative . " We ' re looking for a lot more than that , " he told Reuters , " It ' s a way above 600 million . "

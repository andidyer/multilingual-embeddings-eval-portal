RUGBY UNION - PIENAAR AND STRANSKY ATTACK MARKGRAAFF COMMENTS . Former South African captain Francois Pienaar and fellow World Cup hero Joel Stransky branded racist comments by ousted Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff as " irresponsible " and " sordid " on Wednesday . Markgraaff , who omitted both men from his tour side to Argentina , France and Wales , had his resignation accepted by the South African Rugby Football Union on Tuesday following comments he made about National Sports Council chairman Mluleki George during a taped telephone conversation . Pienaar and Stransky , now playing club rugby in England , are both concerned about the negative impact of Markgraaff ' s comments , but are not getting carried away about a possible international recall against the British Lions later this year . " It is a serious blow to South African rugby . We spent a lot of time building up trust among the communities and now this happens , " said Pienaar , who joined English first division club Saracens in December . " I can ' t make any sense out of it . But people must remember it is the irresponsible views of one person and not the views of the whole country , nor the views of the players . " Even so , the feeling over here now is going to be , have there actually been so many changes in sport in South Africa ? It ' s a serious blow . " Stransky , who signed a two and a half year contract with European Cup finalists Leicester in January , was equally disappointed . " This gives South African rugby rather a dark and sordid image at the moment , " he said . " The players put in a lot of time and effort in helping to get things moving by going into the townships and coaching the kids and this simply casts a lot of seriously dark clouds over the whole thing . " Markgraaff ' s fall , however , could ultimately benefit both Pienaar and Stransky and raise their hopes of playing for the Springboks again , perhaps against the British Lions in June and July . Just over 18 months ago , at Ellis Park , Stransky dropped the goal which beat New Zealand in extra - time of the 1995 World Cup final . Pienaar collected the Webb Ellis Trophy from President Nelson Mandela who , in a move designed to unite the country , was wearing the captain ' s number six jersey . But by the end of last season , with Markgraaff inheriting the coach ' s role from Kitch Christie , both men were out in the cold , overlooked for the Springbok ' s end - of - year tour to Argentina , France and Wales . They subsequently signed contracts with their English clubsPienaar ' s omission , in particular , was a matter of national controversy . He has made not hidden his desire to play for South Africa again but on Wednesday he was playing down his chances of a quick return . " I haven ' t really thought about it , all of this has happened so quickly , but at this stage I don ' t really see myself being involved , " he said . " All I can say is that I am a very loyal person and that the people here at Saracens have shown great faith in me and I intend to repay that . " Stransky , who lost his fly - half berth after a disastrous test against the All Blacks in Durban last year , was marginally more upbeat about his prospects . " It doesn ' t really change anything , although I must admit , from a purely personal point of view , I am pretty happy , " he said . " When I made the decision to come over here ( England ) I logically put international rugby on the back burner although I always hoped that I might get the chance to play for South Africa again . I am always available if I am called up . " But that will be up to the new coach . I won ' t be going back to play provincial rugby in South Africa so if I am going to play against the Lions , I would have to be picked on my performances for Leicester . " If they don ' t want me I ' ll just enjoy a nice summer holiday instead . "

Taiwan stock bull run strong now , but dangers seen . Just one year ago , Taiwan ' s stock market was floundering in a politics - induced slump that shrouded the island ' s entire economy in gloom . Now , share prices are soaring ahead in a marathon bull run that has no immediate end in sight . But securities analysts warned that the rapid rise in stocks had outpaced the slow - recovering economy , and the market may be headed for another long cool - down in the second half of 1997 . They said the factor that had sunk the index in 1996 - - political tensions involving China - - may return to haunt the market later in 1997 with the reversion of British capitalist enclave of Hong Kong to Chinese communist rule in July . The stock index , which fell off the 5 , 000 - point level in March 1996 amid the highest military tension to hit the Taiwan Strait in decades , capped a week of record trading on Saturday by gaining 19 . 76 points to reach a six - year peak of 8 , 182 . 44 . Saturday ' s close surpassed the previous six - year high of 8 , 162 . 68 set just one day earlier , and marked the index ' s highest finish since it reached 8 , 569 . 55 on May 15 , 1990 . " Right now the market is so bullish that investors are not paying a lot of attention to specific factors , " said Allen Huang , fund manager for National Securities . Fuelled by abundant liquidity under the central bank ' s loose monetary policy , Taiwan ' s market has gained more than 1 , 200 points , or 19 percent , in 1997 alone . It has soared by 74 percent since dropping to 4 , 692 . 40 on March 12 , 1996 . Although analysts said they expected the index to steam ahead until the 8 , 500 level , they cautioned that troubling signs were emerging . Economists voiced concern that the big market rise was being driven largely by loose liquidity rather than reflecting fundamental equity value . " To be sure , Taiwan ' s economy is slowly recovering , but from the look of the stock market you would think the economy is surging , " said Chen Han - chung , analyst for Yungli Securities . Recent economic data was mixed . Although the economy grew a high 6 . 62 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 , growth for exports - - the traditional engine for Taiwan ' s economy - - struggled at 2 . 8 percent year - on - year in February . " The stock market is soaring on hope that the economy would prosper later this year . But if it is growing on what is expected to happen , when the economic growth actually occurs there may be no upside left , " said National Securities ' Huang . Even the most bullish investors clearly remember the volatile market ' s panic crash when the bottom fell out following an historic high of 12 , 495 . 34 points on February 10 , 1990 . By October 1 that year , the index was at 2 , 560 . 47 . While another such a tumble was unlikely , the 1997 market may suffer an extended , albeit modest , downward correction once the current momentum stalled , analysts said . " The government was already giving out cautionary signs at the 8 , 000 level , and the market today is more disciplined than it was in 1990 , " said Yungli ' s Chen . " But whenever a market soars by so much without clear economic reasons , it will see a future descent , " he said . The central bank , heeding lessons from the 1990 crash , has issued several warnings over the market ' s current bull . But it has refrained from tightening monetary policy . Economic factors aside , the market awaits another confrontation with an old political nemesis - - China . China , which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since their civil war split them in 1949 , will complete part of its mission to " reunify the motherland " when Hong Kong returns to Beijing ' s rule on July 1 . Although Beijing has promised to keep the colony ' s bustling capitalist system , some Taiwan investors remain jittery on what Beijing interference in Hong Kong affairs might mean for Taiwan ' s own future . " Most people are satisfied that China would leave most of Hong Kong alone , and Hong Kong ' s economy should not suffer , " said Lin Long - hsien , analyst for United Securities . " But political uncertainty , not necessarily instability , is enough to dampen a market , " Lin said .

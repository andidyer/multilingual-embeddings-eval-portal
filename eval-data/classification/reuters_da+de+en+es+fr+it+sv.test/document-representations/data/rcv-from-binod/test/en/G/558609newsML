Palestinians hope Blair will push Mideast peace . The Palestinian Authority on Saturday congratulated British Prime Minister Tony Blair on his election victory and said it hoped his government would help promote Middle East peace moves . " The Palestinian Authority congratulates the new British prime minister and we hope the British policy will be one of pushing the peace process forward , " Nabil Abu Rdainah , adviser to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , told reporters . British - Palestinian relations have improved since the signing of a 1993 PLO - Israel peace framework deal . But Palestinians complain that while Britain has backed their right to a state , it has not done enough to support their cause in Europe . The Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) has traditionally favoured a European role in its peace talks with Israel to act as a balance to the United States . The peace process was plunged into crisis when Israel began work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem on March 18 . Palestinians hope one day to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with Arab East Jerusalem as capital . They view any building in the areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war as pre - empting final peace talks .

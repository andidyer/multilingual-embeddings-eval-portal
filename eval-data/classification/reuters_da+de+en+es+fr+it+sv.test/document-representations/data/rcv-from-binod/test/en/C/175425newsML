FEATURE - Deutsche Telekom issue to go well in U . S . Deutsche Telekom AG ' s privatisation is expected to be fully subscribed in the United States but if the shares price at the top of the 25 to 30 mark range some institutions will only grudgingly subscribe . Of the 500 million shares sold worldwide , 13 - 18 percent are being offered in the Americas , and funds which need a stake in Germany or in telecommunications can hardly avoid it . " We heard U . S . investors are very sceptical of paying more than 25 to 26 marks , " said Oscar Castro , telecom fund manager at Montgomery Asset Management , which manages $ 500 million . " It may not be expensive at 25 marks , but it is not cheap either , " Castro said . " If you are looking for a well - blended global telecoms portfolio it would be remiss if you failed to consider Deutsche Telekom , " said Robert Stuart , managing director of telecommunications for investment bank CIBC Wood Gundy . In fact the company ' s position in important indices , and as a proxy for growth in the German economy as a whole makes it all but unavoidable for those funds . Those funds with the freedom to pursue aggressive growth can be more selective . " There are clearly higher risk , higher return opportunities around the globe , " Stuart added . EUROPE IS KEY TO GLOBAL SUCCESSBut one analyst , whose firm was involved in the issue and who declined identification , said inevitable oversubscription in Europe would ensure success globally . " They are going to make it work . A lot of it is going to be absorbed in Germany , " the analyst said . The final offer price will be set on the weekend of November 15 after the global bookbuilding exercise , and trading of the shares will begin on Monday November 18 . On The New York Stock Exchange they will use the symbol DT . N . Castro said that at the minimum 25 marks , German investors would get an attractive seven percent yield or more because of the effect of a tax credit , but for U . S . investors it was 4 . 8 percent , about average for comparable companies . The price earnings ratio at 25 marks would be 13 . 3 , again in the middle of the range of comparable international telecom stocks which trade at 10 . 8 to 15 times historic earnings . However , analysts believe the international prospects of huge cash - rich companies like Deutsche Telekom will be highlighted by the $ 20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc . On the plus side investors will look at the strength of the international Global One alliance with Sprint Corp and France Telecom to bring in high margin business from multinational companies . " Its going to bring to the forefront the effectiveness of the alliances , " said Tom Elliott , of consultants Arthur Andersen . U . S . WILL LIMIT ACCESS IF OTHERS DO SAMEHowever , investors will see that Deutsche Telekom will not be able to make a bid for any U . S company until at least 1998 when its home market opens to competition . The Federal Communications Commission will allow foreign stakes in excess of 25 percent in U . S . media and telecom firms only when their home markets are truly open and competitive . " I think the FCC has been consistent on what it wants , that it is an issue of true reciprocity , " said CIBC ' s Stuart . If BT does gain a headstart internationally from its union with MCI , then Deutsche Telekom ' s global disadvantage will be crystalised for all to see . Until then the German company should still be able to increase growth by cutting debt . " Earnings growth will be very strong because of the leverage effect of cutting debt by using free cashflow , " Castro said . However , one unequivocal effect is that completion of the Deutsche Telekom stock issue will remove the stock overhang which has been looming over the markets for more than a year , and investors will channel extra cash elsewhere . " Once the deal is done it could end the stock overhang which has depressed some European telecom shares , " said analyst Bob Wilkes of brokers Brown Brothers Harriman . - - New York Newsroom 212 859 1610

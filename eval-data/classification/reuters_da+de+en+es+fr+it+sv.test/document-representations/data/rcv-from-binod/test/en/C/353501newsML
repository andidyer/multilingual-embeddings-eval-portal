ACT promotes weekly Shannon - Tokyo hi - tech charter . General sales agent Air Cargo Trader Ltd ( ACT ) is trying to establish a regular charter flight from Shannon to Tokyo using a Russian Aeroflot Ilyushin - 76 to take advantage of the growth in Irish high tech exports , ACT managing director Roy Douthwaite told Reuters . " We started the flights exporting Intel chips from its factory in the Shannon free trade area before Christmas and are now trying to establish it as a weekly service , " Douthwaite stated . Computer and telecommunication parts are fairly high volume cargo so whilst the Ilyushin can carry over 50 tonnes , it has been taking about 40 tonnes of the high value high - tech components , he noted . The flight is going via Moscow and Novosibirsk . Aeroflot is taking responsibility for any return cargo , he explained . Privately owned ACT , reckons there is potential demand for 100 tonnes weekly of high tech air freight to Japan from Ireland . Currently much of this is trucked to continental Europe or the UK before flying to Japan . In October Singapore Airlines started a weekly service between Singapore and Dublin via Copenhagen and Dubai with Irish hi - tech exports allocated 12 to 15 tonnes of cargo capacity . Due to the high value and commercially sensitive nature of the cargo in fast moving industries , ACT said it has had two flight managers travelling on the Aeroflot charters . From February one , ACT added Miami - based Challenge Air to the list of airlines it acts for as GSA in the UK , Douthwaite said . - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax : 5017

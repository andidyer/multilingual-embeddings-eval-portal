RUGBY UNION - Meurant amused by Warriors bloodletting . AUCKLAND , April 30 - Waikato Chiefs Super 12 rugby coach Brad Meurant returned from South Africa to watch with some amusement the bloodletting at the Auckland Warriors rugby league club headquarters , NZPA reports . The Warriors sacked coach John Monie late yesterday . Meurant is under pressure himself as the Chiefs continue to spiral downwards on the Super 12 table . After two losses in South Africa to Northern Transvaal and Free State , Waikato are pretty much out of semifinals contention . " I ' m glad I ' m not John Monie , but I think I ' m running a very close second , " Meurant quipped . " Every coach knows that it is par for the course if you don ' t perform you don ' t get the job . " It doesn ' t make it any easier being a professional coach because it is a fickle business . " Meurant said he would be reassessing his own future at the end of the Super 12 competition . " For sure there has been pressure on me , but there is pressure on a coach to keep winning if you are on a roll and to get out of a rut if you ' re losing , " he said . " We have to look at the reality of the situation and assess where we are at when we come to the end of the season . " He said as far as he was concerned the Chiefs would be dreaming to consider any lingering hopes of making the semifinals . " We can ' t sit by and look at the ponderables , it doesn ' t matter if we get maximum points in our remaining three matches . If we were to get to the semifinals we should have done it without waiting on others . " The Chiefs ' immediate concerns , he said , were to put another dent on the ailing Gauteng Lions at Rugby Park , Hamilton on Saturday night . " We ' ve put a couple of South African teams back on track over there , we lost to Natal as well and now I feel we owe the South Africans one back , " he said . " We ' re motivated to play well in Hamilton in our last game here , we ' re motivated by the fact that we ' ve been on the receiving end of South African teams . " Most of all we ' re motivated because we want to finish this season strong and get as far up the ladder now as possible . " Meurant will name his team on Thursday with the only doubt over openside flanker Dean Anglesey , who sustained a shoulder injury on the weekend against the Free State Cheetahs .

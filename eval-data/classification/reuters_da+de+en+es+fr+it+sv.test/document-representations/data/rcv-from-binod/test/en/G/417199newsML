Chad president ' s party cries foul over poll result . President Idriss Deby ' s party accused Chad ' s independent electoral commission on Tuesday of foul play after it published results showing him falling short of an outright majority in parliamentary elections . Provisional results of February run - offs , issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission late on Monday , showed Deby ' s Patriotic Salvation Movement ( MPS ) with 55 of the new national assembly ' s 125 seats . But his party said in a statement that by its calculations it had won 65 seats and it asked the appeal court , which has yet to publish final results , to rule on the matter . " These results have been scandalously manipulated by the independent national electoral commission , " it said , expressing its " stupefaction " . Deby , a former guerrilla leader from the Moslem north , seized power in a 1990 French - backed coup after decades of civil war or conflict with Libya . After repeated electoral delays , he won a multi - party presidential election in July . Monday ' s results showed the Moslem north and Christian south voting along regional lines during the two rounds of the parliamentary poll in January and February . Deby ' s southern rival General Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue , the runner - up in July , and his Union for Renewal and Democracy ( URD ) , won 31 seats , according to the provisional results . Foreign Minister Saleh Kebzabo and his National Union for Development and Renewal ( UNDR ) won 15 . The appeal court is expected to take several days to sift through complaints from candidates . UNDR sources say they signed an accord with Deby ' s party between the two rounds of voting on forming a majority . " If the agreement is respected then the two parties will have a majority of 70 seats in the national assembly , " one said . Chad , a sprawling former French colony on the fringes of the Sahara desert , previously had a 57 - member interim assembly under a 1993 transitional charter .

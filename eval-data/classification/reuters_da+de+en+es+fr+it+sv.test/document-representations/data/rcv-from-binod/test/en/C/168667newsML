VSI Enterprises sees improved revenues . VSI Enterprises Inc said on Wednesday that it expects a trend of increasing revenues to continue in the fourth quarter and in the 1997 fiscal year . The company ' s revenues have improved each succeeding quarter this year , it said . VSI Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Snelling said in a statement that the projected upswing in the fourth quarter reflects the recent acquisition of Eastern Telecom Inc , continued growth in its core domestic and European videoconferencing operations , as well as growth from its subsidiary , Integrated Network Services Inc . For the third quarter , VSI Enterprises reported a net loss of $ 1 . 77 million , or $ 0 . 05 per share , on revenues of $ 4 . 26 million . This year ' s third quarter revenues , which did not include operations from Eastern Telecom , were 23 percent lower than the revenues reported in the prior year ' s third quarter , the company said . The company attributed the revenue decline to Integrated Network Services , which was acquired in June in a pooling of interest . VSI Enterprises also said the unexpected death of Integrated ' s chairman and chief executive in early 1996 hurt sales efforts before the acquisition .

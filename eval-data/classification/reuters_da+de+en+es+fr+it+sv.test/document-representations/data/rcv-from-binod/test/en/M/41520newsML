COTTON - USDA estimate 18 . 3 mln - 18 . 8 mln bales - trade . Beneficial rains in Texas and the Southeast in the past month could result in higher cotton yields , prompting the U . S . Department of Agriculture to raise its estimate for the 1996 / 97 crop , industry sources said . They put the USDA ' s production estimate between 18 . 3 million and 18 . 8 million 480 - lb bales , compared with a forecast of 18 . 577 million bales on August 12 . Most projections came in at the high end of the range despite boll shedding in California and Arizona , which is likely to cause losses in those states . The USDA will release its September report Wednesday at 0830 EDT . " The rains in August were extremely helpful to yields in West Texas , " said Sharon Johnson , an analyst with Frank Schneider and Co Inc . She put the USDA estimate at 18 . 707 million bales , with the bulk of increases coming in Texas and the Delta , and in southeastern states including Louisiana and Georgia . Carl Anderson , a cotton marketing specialist with Texas A & M University agreed the USDA will boost its estimates for those states , and pegged the estimate at 18 . 8 million bales . The USDA could raise its production forecast for Texas by as many as 100 , 000 bales . " But there is no telling what the hurricane damage will be , " Anderson said , in reference to Hurricane Fran which swept through North and South Carolina last week . Some industry sources said the hurricane may have brought beneficial rains while others predicted losses and damage to open bolls . " Fran changes the picture considerably but it is too soon ( to determine losses ) , " said Jarral Neeper , an analyst with Calcot Ltd . He pegged the estimate at 18 . 717 million bales . Smith Barney analyst David Brandon compared the effect of Hurricane Fran to that of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 , which he said buoyed yields in North and South Carolina . He said a similar effect , coupled with increases in Texas and the Delta , will lead the USDA to raise its U . S . production estimate to 18 . 8 million bales . Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes put the USDA ' s September estimate below the August forecast at 18 . 3 million bales , based on declining crop conditions in the past month . While U . S . production was generally seen higher , exports are likely to fall in the USDA ' s September report , industry sources said . They put 1996 / 97 exports between 6 . 2 million and 6 . 4 million bales , compared with 6 . 6 million bales last month . The combination of higher output and weak exports is likely to result in lower futures prices , they added . " How bad the crop is in China , and ( the effects of ) flooding in India and Pakistan could build the potential for exports , " Anderson said . " Until then , however , there is no reason for prices to remain high . " Neeper of Calcot said slack weekly sales and high domestic prices relative the rest of the world could slash exports substantially in the longer term . " Unless we become price competitive , I think realistically we ' re likely to see 5 . 5 million to 6 . 0 million bales , " he said . - - New York Commodity Desk , 212 - 859 - 1647

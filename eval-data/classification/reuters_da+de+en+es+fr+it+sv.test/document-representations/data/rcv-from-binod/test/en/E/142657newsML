Canada ' s Martin says very optimistic on economy . Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said on Friday he felt good about Canada ' s economy . " We really have all the factors to give us a strong economy - - falling inflation , rising productivity . . . , " Martin told reporters at a Liberal Party convention . " We are also creating jobs at a faster pace than many other countries . Not as fast as we would like , but still pretty fast . I am very optimistic . " Martin repeated that his government will not introduce any broad - based tax cuts for now , but said that there will be targetted tax cuts . " We are not going to bring in a broad - based tax cut at this time . It would be unfair in terms of future generation , it would see interest rates going through the roof , " Martin said . " But we will constantly looki at selective tax cuts . . . . We are going to focus on those areas where we will get the maximum impact from the action taken . " Asked what those areas might be , Martin said : " Obviously , child poverty , research and development , our capacity to create jobs . " The government is widely expected to call a national election by the fall of 1997 . - - Reuters Ottawa Bureau 613 - 235 - 6745

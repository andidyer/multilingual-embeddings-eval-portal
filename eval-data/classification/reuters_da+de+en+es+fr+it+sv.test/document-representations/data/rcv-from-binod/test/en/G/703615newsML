Australia ' s Downer tells media - give HK a chance . Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer urged international media on Wednesday to give Hong Kong a chance under Chinese rule and not assume the worst . " Let ' s give Hong Kong a chance , okay ? " , Downer said in response to questions about human rights in Hong Kong in the wake of its handover from British to Chinese rule on Tuesday . " Don ' t run a scare campaign until we know what ' s happening on the ground , " Downer advised reporters . He was speaking after meeting pro - democracy leader Martin Lee . Downer noted that three separate demonstrations were held in Hong Kong on Tuesday and protesters had criticised China openly . It was too early to assess whether democracy would be curbed but , he said , " so far my impression is that freedom of speech and civil liberties are in place " . Downer said new leader Tung Chee - hwa had pledged to hold elections next May and Australia would be watching closely to see what form a new election law would take . Hong Kong is now a Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) of China , making it largely an autonomous territory - - except for defence and foreign policy . Under a 1984 Sino - British accord , Hong Kong will keep its capitalist way of life for 50 years but pro - democracy activists have accused Tung and China of reversing political reforms introduced near the end of Britain ' s 156 - year rule .

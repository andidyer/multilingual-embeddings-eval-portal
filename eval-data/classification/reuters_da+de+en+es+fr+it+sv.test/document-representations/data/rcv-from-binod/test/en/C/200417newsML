Brio unit sells pop assets to Cott . Brio Industries Inc said on Tuesday that its Brio Beverages unit has sold certain carbonated soft drink assets to a subsidiary of Cott Corp for about C $ 19 . 5 million in cash . Under the terms of the deal , Brio Beverages will receive up to an additional C $ 1 . 25 million per year for five consecutive years for a total maximum of C $ 6 . 25 million in additional cash . The additional cash is based upon the increase in gross profit of the combined Cott / Brio Western Canadian operations , after certain adjustments , the company said . The Brio assets sold to Cott include Brio ' s Vancouver plant as well as equipment from its carbonated soft drink facility in Edmonton . " The transaction gives us a strong base on which to start the next fiscal year , which begins on March 1 , 1997 . We anticipate that Brio will turn the corner to profitability commencing in the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 , " said Ralph McRae , Brio ' s chairman and chief executive officer . The asset sale has allowed Brio to repay all of its operating debt and more than half of its term debt . It will retain about C $ 8 million in cash to pursue future expansion . Brio said the transaction concludes the most important aspect of its restructuring , which began in March . As a result , president and chief executive Robert Hunt , who was brought on board to assist with the restructuring , will be moving on . Chairman Ralph McRae has assumed the duties of president and chief executive . - - Reuters Toronto Bureau ( 416 ) 941 - 8100

Opponents force delay of Brazil ' s mine privatization . Michael ChristieBrazil ' s proposed privatisation of mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce ran into delays Tuesday as it provoked a flurry of last minute legal challenges and a violent protest in the heart of the city . Planning Minister Antonio Kandir remained confident Tuesday that the auction would go ahead despite the challenges that forced a delay from its scheduled 10 a . m . start . In Rio de Janeiro , about 2 , 000 stone - throwing leftists and students clashed with riot police , turning the city centre into a battle field . The sell - off of 45 percent of the company , the largest exporter of iron ore in the world , was expected to raise $ 5 billion for the government and would be the largest privatisation ever in Latin America . " The minister is still confident the auction will go ahead , " said an aide to Kandir , adding that National Development Bank lawyers were managing to successfully appeal injunctions at a faster rate than opponents were having them issued . " We are just going to have to wait for the end of the day , " the aide said . The development bank , which runs Brazil ' s privatisation programme , set a deadline of 5 p . m . to get the sell - off under way or suspend it . By midday , a bank spokesman said at least 18 injunctions had been issued and eight of those had been revoked . Officials acknowledged that a lawsuit in Sao Paulo , on which government appeals had twice been rejected , was proving the most troublesome . " Sao Paulo is the only real problem we face , " Kandir ' s aide said . The sale has attracted considerable controversy , with opponents ranging from former Presidents Jose Sarney and Itamar Franco to the country ' s Catholic bishops accusing the government of selling the country out to foreigners for a pittance . The flurry of lawsuits against the sale , a favourite tactic of privatisation foes , came as no surprise . Nevertheless it seemed to have overwhelmed the 120 government lawyers who have been flying around the country in four specially hired jets to take on injunctions . The legal battle was mirrored outside the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange where hundreds of demonstrators trying to break through a security cordon fought with police , throwing rocks and cans . Police retreating towards the exchange fired stun grenades and tear gas into the crowds and called in water cannons . Authorities said several people were injured before the violence died down at midday . Two multinational consortia were in the bidding for the stake . One was being led by Brazilian steelmaker CSN and the other by local pulp , cement and metal concern Votorantim and Anglo American Corp . of South Africa Ltd . CVRD ' s Carajas mine , deep in the Amazon , holds the world ' s largest iron ore deposit estimated at 18 billion metric tons . The group , which enjoys a rare public sector reputation for efficiency , also mines copper , gold and manganese .

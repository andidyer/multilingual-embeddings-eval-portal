Caspian status quarrel not deterring oil deals . Foreign firms involved in oil projects in the energy - rich Caspian Sea say that disputes over the water ' s territorial status have had little or no effect on their multi - billion dollar investment plans . " All of the companies doing business here are proceeding on the basis that the Caspian ' s status will be resolved , " said Exxon Corp ' s government affairs manager , James R . Riley . " It doesn ' t really change what we do . " The governments of Russia and Iran - - two of the five states bordering the Caspian and claiming its massive , untapped energy reserves - - say the large , salty body is really a lake whose resources should be jointly exploited . But the other three countries bordering the Caspian - - Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - - say it is technically and geologically a sea , governed by international laws and covenants allowing the right to develop oil and gas reserves in individual " sectors " . Azerbaijan has raced ahead with the sectoral approach , attracting around half a dozen giant , multinational consortiums which are investing a total of $ 18 billion in its chunk of the Caspian . The former Soviet republic is close to signing at least four more big deals by the end of the year . In one of the next generation of deals , officials from Azeri state oil company SOCAR say Chevron is expected to ink a deal on the Zeinalabdin - Tagiyev offshore field by 1998 . " It is not unusual in any place that there are unresolved boundary questions , " said Timothy A . Anderson , a senior advisor at Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc in Baku . " It is not our affair to resolve them . If we thought that it was a limitation , then we wouldn ' t be involved here . " Iranian and Russian companies also seem to be little affected by the dispute , despite their governments ' insistence that the Caspian cannot be unilaterally exploited by its littoral states . " The fact that we want to be involved in projects in Azerbaijan is obvious , " said J . Kasraee , Marketing Director for Iran ' s Oil Industries ' Engineering and Construction ( OIEC ) . Kasraee said his privately - owned company " had heard some concerns " in Iranian government circles when it first became involved in Azeri projects but that it had never been told not to do business here . " If companies here were so concerned about the Caspian ' s status , then they wouldn ' t be doing business here , " said Rafik Abdullayev , an advisor to SOCAR President Natik Aliyev . " This is all a question of money , and our region is too lucrative to miss out on . " Energy officials have said that even Russia , keen to control the flow of oil from the region , is quietly admitting it must be more aggressive about getting into Caspian oil deals . The status dispute has not prevented Russia ' s LUKoil , already a participant in three offshore Azeri deals , from seeking more . Even Russian state - owned oil holding company Rosneft has lately shown an interest in the area . " The ( status ) issue is something that each foreign company doing business here must take into account , " Kasraee said . " Maybe by the end of the century we can ship all the politicians from all countries to an island somewhere , where they can talk about it as long as they want . " They get in the way , but in the end , economics talk . "

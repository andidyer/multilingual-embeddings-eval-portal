China says Beijing , Xinjiang blasts unrelated . Chinese officials said on Monday there was no evidence linking a bombing in the Chinese capital last week with earlier attacks in the restive region of Xinjiang . " So far we have uncovered no connection , " Beijing Mayor Jia Qingling told reporters when asked if the attacks in Beijing and Moslem Xinjiang were related . Jia made the remarks before the start of a session of the National People ' s Congress , China ' s parliament , which is holding its annual session in Beijing . Other officials were also unwilling to make a connection , despite statements by exiled separatist groups from the far western region of Xinjiang claiming responsibility . " This ( Beijing bombing ) incident does not have a lot of similarities with those in ( Xinjiang ' s capital ) Urumqi , " said Xinjiang Communist Party boss Wang Lequan . " Staging bomb attacks is not exclusive to Xinjiang people , " he told reporters at the parliament session . A bomb on a Beijing bus during the evening rush hour on Friday killed at least two people and wounded about 30 , sources said . Three bomb attacks on buses in Urumqi last month killed nine and wounded 74 . Exiled ethnic Uighurs , who want to set up an independent state of " East Turkestan " in Xinjiang , have claimed responsibility for both the Beijing and Urumqi bombings . They have vowed to stage more attacks until they gain " complete freedom " for their homeland . Minister of Public Security Tao Siju also denied any link to Moslem Uighur exiles , saying the attacks did not appear related although authorities were still investigating . Mayor Jia said he was confident police would capture those responsible , officially described as criminal elements . " With the support of our police and the masses , we definitely have confidence , " Jia said when asked if authorities believed they were near solving the case . Jia and other officials did not refer to another bombing in Beijing earlier last week . That explosion did no damage , according to a semi - official news service . But the Beijing mayor said authorities in the capital had moved to tighten security . Police have called on hotels in Beijing to strengthen security , hotel officials said . Police held an emergency meeting with hotel management and security officials on Saturday and asked them to be alert for suspicious people or packages left unattended . " They called in security people and night managers , " said an official at a foreign - run hotel . " They requested all hotels be vigilant in checking for suspicious people and ensuring that packages were not left behind " in restaurants or hotel lobbies , the official said . Executives at other hotels in Beijing said police had called security meetings before but the bombings had clearly created concerns over potential threats to foreign and Chinese tourists . Taxi drivers in the Chinese capital have also said they were asked not to give rides to suspicious looking people from Xinjiang and to be especially cautious in neighbourhoods where many Uighur migrants live . A post and telecommunication official said post offices had stepped up checks for possible bomb parcels .

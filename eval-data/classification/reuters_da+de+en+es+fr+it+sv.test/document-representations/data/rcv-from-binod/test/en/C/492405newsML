Southern Glass plans 390 mln yuan rights issue . China Southern Glass Holdings Co Ltd , which posted a 14 percent jump in 1996 net profit , plans to raise 390 million yuan from a rights issue this year , a company spokesman said on Monday . The firm has tentatively priced the issue at 4 . 0 yuan , or HK $ 3 . 70 , per rights share , the company spokesman told the Hong Kong - based newsletter China Securities Bulletin . Shareholders have given approval for the issue , although it still requires the final approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission , he said . If successful , Southern Glass will inject 150 million yuan into its 1 . 1 billion yuan super - thin float glass plant in Shenzhen which began partial production in December . It will use the remaining rights funds to boost production of new products such as glass for mobile phones and computers , and electronic ceramics , the spokesman said . " We see promising prospects for the new products , which accounted for only a small portion of the firm ' s 1996 net profit , " he said . He said competition is getting increasingly intense in the domestic construction glass market . About 70 percent of Southern Glass ' s products were sold in China last year , with the remaining 30 percent exported to the United States , Australia and Hong Kong , the spokesman said . Profit from the float glass plant will be limited in 1997 as it is operating only on a trial basis . But it will become Southern Glass ' s major profit source in 1998 , he said . Southern Glass said on Saturday it booked net profits of 153 . 04 million yuan for 1996 , up from 127 . 00 million yuan in 1995 mainly due to success in controlling production and sales costs .

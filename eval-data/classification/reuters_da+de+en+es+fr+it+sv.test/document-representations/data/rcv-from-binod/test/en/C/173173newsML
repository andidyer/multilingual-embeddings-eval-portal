BTA shares seen rising after 9 - mo results . The share price of Banco Totta e Acores has room to rise by up to two percent in the coming days after the Portuguese bank showed a 5 . 7 percent increased in profits in the first nine months , but profit - taking could limit gains , analysts said . The bank , part of the financial services group of businessman Antonio Champalimaud , on Wednesday announced a consolidated net profit of 16 . 74 billion escudos , up from 15 . 85 billion in the same year - ago period . " Totta ' s results are good and this should allow most analysts to revise upwards their full - year 1996 profit forecasts for the bank , " said one analyst , who asked not to be identified . Another analyst said the profit increase depended heavily on gains from trading . Totta ' s profits from trading activities in the first nine months were 6 . 9 billion escudos , sharply up from trading profits of 1 . 1 billion in the same 1995 period , market sources said . The bank ' s financial margin was practically unchanged , standing at 63 . 7 billion escudos in the first nine months this year , compared with 63 . 8 billion in the same year - ago period . " There was a 17 percent growth in loans , basically due to mortgage credit , but there are some doubts about the quality of the loan portfolio in the future , " said the second analyst , who also asked not to be identified . He was referring to a view that credit facilities can be obtained easily in the present market . Analysts said the bank ' s results , which included a six percent year - on - year growth in deposits and a 17 percent increase in structural costs , revealed an unimpressive performance in its " core business . " " The quality of the results is not great and growth is due largely to the cancellation of the need for provisions , " the second analyst said . Net provisions stood at 8 . 6 billion escudos in the first nine months this year , compared with 10 . 4 billion in the same year - ago period . " I think these results will not alter the expectations of the market , although I think people had hoped for stronger growth in the nine months , " the second analyst said . Forecasts of three analysts polled by Reuters for Totta ' s 1996 profits ranged from 16 . 5 to 18 . 1 billion escudos and for 1997 from 16 . 9 to 18 . 8 billion escudos . Totta stood at 2 , 889 escudos , down 16 , in turnover of 2 , 363 shares at 1047 GMT on Thursday . - - Paula Cordeiro , Lisbon newsroom + 351 - 1 - 3538254

Germany charges Bosnia Serb with aiding genocide . The German Federal Prosecutor ' s Office said on Thursday it had charged a 33 - year - old Bosnian Serb with aiding in genocide and murder for his role in attacks on and disappearance of Moslems during the Bosnian War . The office said the man , identified only as Novislav D , was believed to have been part of a group of Serb fighters who were responsible for carrying out ethnic cleansing policies in the Foca region . In June 1992 , the office said , Novislav D . took part in a raid in which 14 Moslem men were killed and 15 others taken prisoner . The 15 prisoners were never seen again . Novislav D . has lived in Germany since 1993 . He was arrested in Munich on January 16 , 1996 . Although the offences were not committed in Germany , Novislav D . can be tried here under a clause in international law which says that the perpetrators of genocide may not receive shelter anywhere and can be tried abroad . The case is not linked to the United Nations war crimes Tribunal in The Hague . The tribunal has so far indicted over 70 Bosnian Serbs , Croats and Moslems , but only a few have been arrested while the majority are still at large .

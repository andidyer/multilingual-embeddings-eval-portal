Zaire says ' very violent ' fighting at Kenge . The embattled government of Zaire ' s President Mobutu Sese Seko said on Monday the army was pushing back an attack from Laurent Kabila ' s rebels in fighting at Kenge 200 km ( 125 miles ) from the capital Kinshasa . " The fighting is very violent in the region of Kenge , the FAZ ( Zairean Armed Forces ) are busy maintaining the front line and pushing back , " information minister Kin - Kiey Mulumba said on state radio after a special cabinet meeting . Kin - Kiey denied rebel claims that government forces were preparing to kill foreign expatriates in Kinshasa , to encourage intervention from Western troops based in Brazzaville , three km ( two miles ) across the Zaire river . " This should be clearly said , the FAZ have never had a plan to kill either foreigners or nationals , " Kin - Kiey said . Since launching their rebellion in October , Kabila ' s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Condgo - Zaire ( AFDL ) have occupied three quarters of the vast mineral - rich country at the heart of Africa . Mobutu and Kabila are due to meet for talks on board a South African ship on Wednesday , but the rebels have said they will not let up on their military operation to overthrow ailing Mobutu , who has ruled Zaire for more than three decades .

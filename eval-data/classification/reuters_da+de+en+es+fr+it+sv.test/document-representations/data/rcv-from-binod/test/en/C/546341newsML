Russians , Slovaks sign gas deals enhancing supplies . Russia and Slovakia on Tuesday signed a series of contracts aimed at enhancing the supplies and flow of Russian natural gas to central and eastern Europe . In a signing ceremony as part of an official three - day visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , Gazprom and Slovak gas distributor SPP signed a contract to form a joint - venture to manage deliveries of Russian gas above contracted quotas to western Europe . " This is the first long - term treaty we have concluded with any state , it goes to the year 2008 and contains clauses for future prospects , " Chernomyrdin told journalists . The amount of gas to be supplied under the contract was not revealed , but the Russian firm supplied virtually all of Slovakia ' s six billion cubic metre consumption last year . " This contract means the full coverage of Slovakia ' s consumption to the year 2008 , " Chernomyrdin added . Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar , who accompanied Chernomyrdin on a tour of oil refiner Slovnaft , said the two countries were also in talks over further cooperation in the energy sector , including crude oil exploration , sales and refining . " Slovnaft will be included in these possible deals , " Chernomyrdin added . SPP and Russia ' s Gazexport meanwhile concluded long - term deals on natural gas supplies to Slovakia and on the supplies the joint - venture will transfer . Plans for the Russian - Slovak gas joint venture , which has yet to be named , initially sparked controversy when announced at the beginning of the month . Slovak opposition deputies in parliament fiercely criticised the project , saying it would lead to heavier reliance on Russia by Slovakia . But the Slovak government rejected the criticism and forged ahead with the plan , arguing the proposed 50 - 50 joint venture would help Slovakia retain its position as one of the world ' s largest gas transporters . SPP already manages transit of Russian gas to western Europe , which last year totalled around 80 billion cubic metres . The pipeline , which began operation in April 1971 , serves 10 major consumers in central and western Europe . Gazprom pays for the transfer by supplying about four billion cubic metres of gas to Slovak consumers , which covers about two thirds of domestic annual consumption .

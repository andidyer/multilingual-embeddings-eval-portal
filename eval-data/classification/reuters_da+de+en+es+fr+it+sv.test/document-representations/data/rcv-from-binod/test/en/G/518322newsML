Israel ' s Netanyahu vows to fight rather than quit . Israel ' s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to quit on Thursday in the face of a corruption scandal tagged a political " bombshell " and an " earthquake " by Israelis across the political spectrum . The 47 - year - old Likud party leader , usually a verbal prizefighter , had nothing to say after police stunned the country on Wednesday by saying they recommended he be tried for fraud and breach of trust . But faced with red banner headlines in Israel ' s newspapers , Netanyahu ' s spokesmen rushed to his defence on Thursday . " The prime minister has no intention of going now to elections or resigning or suspending himself , " spokesman Shai Bazak told Israel Radio . " The prime minister is confident of his innocence . We are all sure of it . " U . S . envoy Dennis Ross tried to salvage Israel - PLO peacemaking on the second day of a Middle East mission but suspicions of Israeli influence - peddling cast a giant shadow over the American ' s meeting with Netanyahu . Netanyahu ' s communications chief David Bar - Illan tried to put a good face on the situation , telling Reuters : " At least for a few days . . . it will be very difficult to make decisions , I imagine , on either side . " But I expect that once this has gotten out of the way the peace process will continue , " he added . Prosecutors pored for a third straight day over police recommendations to try Netanyahu over the appointment of political crony Roni Bar - On as attorney general in January . Bar - on resigned hours after the appointment amidst public outcry he was not fit for the job . But with several " ifs " yet to be addressed , it was by no means certain Netanyahu would be charged . Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein promised to act by Monday on a 995 - page police recommendation to charge Netanyahu , his director - general Avigdor Lieberman , Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi , and political ally Aryeh Deri . The battle for public opinion turned fierce meanwhile between aides to Netanyahu and the Labour party opposition led by Shimon Peres , who lost the election to Netanyahu 11 months ago by fewer than 30 , 000 votes . " The recommendation is based on very flimsy evidence of just one person , a person who is himself an interested party and therefore we cannot imagine the attorney general will actually decide to press charges , " Bar - Illan insisted . Labour ' s parliamentary faction demanded Netanyahu resign . " The prime minister from the public moral standpoint in my view is not fit to fill the job and must draw conclusions , " said former Labour police minister Moshe Shahal . Peres called the affair a " political earthquake " . Israel ' s Channel One has alleged since the short - lived appointment three months ago that Deri , an ultra - Orthodox kingmaker on trial for corruption , pushed Bar - On for the attorney general ' s job in hopes of winning a plea bargain . The television said Deri had promised that in return , his Shas party would support Netanyahu ' s deal with the Palestinians for an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron in the West Bank . Netanyahu ' s Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said someone had leaked information hoping to influence prosecutors and topple the government . But police countered with a statement saying they were apolitical and acting within the law . Netanyahu ' s lawyer Yaacov Weinroth , calling the charges " baseless " , said police had in any event qualified their recommendation by saying Netanyahu - - already interrogated once for several hours - - would have to be questioned again . The head of Israel ' s parliament law committee urged Netanyahu to take leave and demand that charges be brought against him . Shaul Yahalom , of Netanyahu ' s coalition , said that was the only way to put an end to the scandal swiftly . " We ' re talking about a very serious bombshell , " Yahalom , a champion of Jewish settlement of occupied Arab lands , said of the police recommendation . Investors reacted to news of a possible indictment by seeking haven in the dollar and dumping Israeli shares .

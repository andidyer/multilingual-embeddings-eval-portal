Romania to shut three inefficient oil refineries . Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea pledged on Thursday to shut three of Romania ' s nine under - used state oil refineries in a drive to overhaul obsolete , communist - era industry . He said the affected refineries had no hope of competing in regional markets . " Starting today , supplies of electricity , crude oil and water will be cut to three refineries : Petrotel , Darmanesti and Vega , " said Ciorbea , outlining the outcome of a month - long IMF assessment of Romania ' s market reforms . " We must target the oil processing sector for restructuring . All the refineries are working at 50 percent of their capacity or less . All work at a loss , " he told a news conference . He said European markets were " saturated " with oil products and Romania ' s facilities " cannot yet compete with others in the region " . The closures meant laying off 8 , 000 employees . The sector accounted for 2 . 2 percent of Romania ' s vast arrears among companies , he said , adding it was not up to the government or its privatisation agency to decide on closures . " Only the market economy can decide this , " he said . The International Monetary Fund ' s chief negotiator for Romania , Poul Thomsen , praised the centrist government ' s achievements in stabilising the economy . But he singled out the failure to restructure bloated industry as the main shortcoming of reform plans launched since Romania ' s centrists won the 1996 elections , defeating ex - communist leftists . " This has to happen here , now , " Ciorbea told Reuters . " And we have to be realistic about this . It means taking on the traditional strong vested interests - - the mining sector , the refining sector . " The difficult problems are still ahead . " Bucharest radio announced earlier on Thursday that trade unions in the oil sector had threatened to start street protests against plans to streamline the industry . The refining sector , deliberately expanded by the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu as part of a policy of economic independence , is a conspicuous example of oversized industry built up under communist rule . Romania has an refining capacity of some 34 million tonnes a year , compared to domestic consumption of 10 million tonnes . It operates a capacity of well over 20 million tonnes , but one oil specialist said any reduction below 18 million tonnes was unfeasible for the industry . Confusion has surrounded plans to restructure large industrial plants , with different lists of candidates for closure or sell - off being issued in recent months . The government this month postponed a plan to dissolve the state - owned National Oil Company ( CRP ) , which groups refineries , transport and distribution companies and research institutes , pending a decision on which facilities to keep operating . Of the refineries named for closure on Thursday , only one , Darmanesti in the eastern region of Moldova with a capacity of one million tonnes , was on an earlier list for restructuring . Plans to privatise the plant have collapsed . The newer Petrotel refinery , in the Ploiesti oilfield north of Bucharest , also has a capacity of one million tonnes and is plagued by poor technical and economic performance . The Vega refinery , also in Ploiesti but smaller at 800 , 000 tonnes , is handicapped by the low demand for its specialised products . One of Romania ' s most modern refineries , Petromidia , on the Black Sea coast , was also originally on a list for restructuring , but is now being offered for sell - off . The State Privatisation Agency ( FPS ) was due to announce on Friday the names of companies with which it will start talks on Petromidia , modernised since the 1989 fall of communism at a cost of about $ 50 million .

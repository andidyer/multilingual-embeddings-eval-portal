Run - hit Hungary bank is smear victim , chairman says . Hungary ' s Postabank , which lost 21 billion forints in just over three days in a run by depositors , was the victim of an organised smear campaign , the bank ' s chairman said on Monday . Gabor Princz , chairman and chief executive of Hungary ' s second biggest bank , told Reuters in an interview the bank would survive despite the run and had lost none of its big depositors . " We are of the opinion that this was deliberately organised beforehand , the whole action , because an action like this cannot be carried out otherwise , " Princz said . Princz said that several days before the run began last Thursday afternoon " agents appeared in our branches and the countryside and they spread rumours " . " When the hysteria was going on there were some provocateurs who made announcements among the people and called up our corporate customers to make the panic stronger , " he said . He said the matter was under investigation by the interior ministry and he could only guess at the motivation . " I am only aware that Postabank was the second largest bank in Hungary at the end of last year and the newspapers last week published the index of the popularity of financial institutions , " he said . " Logically it cannot be explained how people ' s opinion of Postabank can change in one and a half days in such a way . " He acknowledged that rumours about the bank had been circulating in Budapest for some time before the run and admitted that perhaps the bank should have acted sooner . " But these were among the elite and the fact that they got to the countryside overnight shows this has to be organised . " Princz said Postabank had to scramble to meet depositors demands by staying open late hours and into the weekend . " We had to cope with a very large responsibility because we had to protect not only Postabank but the entire Hungarian banking system , " he said . He said the bank had been able to meet all depositors ' demands from its own reserves and had not had to draw on the National Bank of Hungary for support . " We always emphasised that our infrastructure is very developed but I never expected to test it like this , " he said . He said that to his knowledge none of the bank ' s big clients had closed their accounts . Princz said that before the run , Postabank had hoped to position itself to attract more foreign customers . To this end it recently retained Arthur Andersen and planned to conduct audits to international rather than Hungarian practices . But strategies would now have to be reviewed , he said . " Something like this never happened to us so we will have to think it over . . . all our international relations could be affected , " he said . - - Michael Roddy , Budapest newsroom + + 36 1 327 4040

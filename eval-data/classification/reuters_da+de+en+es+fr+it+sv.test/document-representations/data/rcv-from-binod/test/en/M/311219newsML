IPE Brent ends lower , correcting yesterday ' s gains . IPE Brent closed weaker on Thursday having spent most of the day consolidating a downwards correction brought about by Wednesday ' s gains . " We were correcting yesterday ' s move higher which was a touch overdone , " said one broker . March Brent closed on Thursday at $ 23 . 07 a barrel , down 58 cents having traded in a narrow range for much of the day following initial losses in the morning . Towards the close the contract toyed with support at $ 23 . 00 , but came no nearer than $ 23 . 04 . March Brent ' s inability to break $ 24 . 00 and WTI ' s lack of strength in passing $ 26 . 00 earlier in the day took steam out of the complex which was not regained . The February Brent contract , which expired at close of business , ended weaker . Activity was thin except for a slight flurry towards the end as positions were cleared . Feb closed down 25 cents at $ 23 . 59 a barrel . Heating oil gave little support despite a cold snap which is set to whip up arctic - like conditions in the northeastern United States from Friday since dealers said supply was sufficient to meet demand . February heating oil was down 1 . 47 cents cent at 69 . 95 cents a gallon . Gas oil had earlier ended the day earlier higher having played catch - up to crude ' s late gains on Wednesday . The February contract closed up $ 5 . 25 at $ 219 . 00 a tonne , only 25 cents off the day ' s high . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8980

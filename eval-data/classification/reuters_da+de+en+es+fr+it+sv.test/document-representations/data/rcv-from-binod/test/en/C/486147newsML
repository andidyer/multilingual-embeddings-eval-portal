Australia ' s Westpac launches bid for Melbourne bank . Australia ' s second largest bank , Westpac Banking Corp , said on Thursday it had made an agreed A $ 1 . 435 billion ( US $ 1 . 12 billion ) bid for the regional Bank of Melbourne . The merger move pre - empted the release next week of the findings of a far - reaching government commissioned inquiry into the country ' s financial system , which many analysts believe could see more shake - ups in the banking sector . After news of the bid , Australian Treasurer Peter Costello immediately said the merger would have to wait until cabinet had reviewed and released the " Wallis report " . " The government doesn ' t feel in the slightest pressured by this , " Costello said . The government would have to approve the agreed merger of Westpac - - one of Australia ' s four major bank - - and the Victorian based Bank of Melbourne . Under the proposed merger , Westpac would use the Bank of Melbourne name in Australia ' s southern Victoria state and combine its operations there . It would give existing Bank of Melbourne customers access to products such as credit cards and funds management which the bank did not currently provide . Westpac said that under the merger plan it would offer A $ 9 . 75 per Bank of Melbourne share through alternative offers of A $ 8 . 85 cash and a special dividend of 90 cents per share , or one Westpac share plus A $ 1 . 85 cash . Bank of Melbourne said the Westpac offer valued it at a multiple of 15 . 2 times 1997 prospective earnings forecast , representing 2 . 1 times net assets - - a similar level to the valuation of other regional banks taken over by the four major Australians . Westpac itself has been seen as a target for takeover by Australia ' s largest bank , National Australia Bank . Analysts said a successful takeover of the Bank of Melbourne would make Westpac less vulnerable to takeover as it would increase its market share in Victoria . A $ 1 = US $ 0 . 7820

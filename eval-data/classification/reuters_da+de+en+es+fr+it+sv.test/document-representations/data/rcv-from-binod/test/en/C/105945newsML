Olli - Pekka Lintula , general manager of wireless messaging at Nokia ' s mobile phones division , told Reuters Nokia is including the Internet WorldWide Web address of a MAID information service in the " hotlist " for its new 9000 personal communicator . Nokia is also including MAID information in the Short Message Service ( SMS ) digital mobile service available on the 9000 communicator screens , he said . " This is the extent of cooperation we have with MAID , " he said . In response to analyst talk that a deal was on the cards between MAID and Nokia to start a mobile share price service , he said : " setting up a service is not in the plans of Nokia " . Nokia was keen to work with all companies that are active in setting and defining telecommunications services , he said : " But our role is as an equipment provider and developer . " The idea of an investment - - or of running a service - - was not in Nokia ' s plans , he said . Britain ' s Sunday Times said this week MAID was poised to unveil a screen - based real - time news service at sharply lower prices than those from international news and information group Reuters Plc and financial news group Bloomberg LP . Lintula said Nokia was also cooperating with Reuters , but declined to specify the current status of this . Nokia ' s 9000 personal communicator is a hand - held device enabling voice , fax , Internet and electronic mail communication . Lintula said MAID was a " technologically pro - active company " , interested in fully utilising all the capabilities that the Nokia 9000 offers . - - Helsinki newsroom + 35 80 6805 0247

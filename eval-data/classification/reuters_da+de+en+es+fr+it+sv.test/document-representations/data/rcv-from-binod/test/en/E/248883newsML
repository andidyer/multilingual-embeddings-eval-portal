Poland to grow fast , catching up with West far off . Poland ' s economy should grow between 5 . 5 to six percent annually until 2000 , but this would not be enough to catch up with poorer European Union countries in 15 years , planning ministry officials said on Wednesday . Various estimates already see Poland ' s gross domestic product ( GDP ) growing by about 5 . 5 percent this year and next year after a seven - percent rise in 1995 . " If current policy is realised there ' s a chance we can maintain the quick pace of five - to - six percent to the end of the 90s , " Jozef Zajchowski , a senior CUP analyst , told a news conference . He said that even six - percent annual growth would leave Poland behind the poorer EU countries such as Portugal , Spain and Greece at the end of the next decade and Poland would need growth of 9 - 14 percent annually to achieve similar levels . Zajchowski and Tadeusz Chroscicki , head analyst at CUP , said a positive signal was a 9 . 5 - percent increase in industrial output over the first ten months this year , with October production up 13 . 9 percent . Zajchowski said construction output growth had also gained pace , increasing by 15 . 8 percent in the third quarter but only 5 . 7 percent on the year , largely because of harsh weather in the first quarter . Chroscicki said fourth - quarter construction could increase by 20 percent . He also said this year ' s nine - month 26 . 5 - percent growth in investment by firms employing more than 50 was a good sign , especially the 36 - percent growth in machinery investment . @ But Chroscicki said a negative signal was the balance - of - payments deficit , which should reach $ 8 billion this year and $ 11 billion next year . Chroscicki said the finance ministry ' s forecast of 13 - percent year - on - year inflation at the end of next year was realistic as an expected slow - down in farm food - price growth should help reduce inflation from this year ' s levels . The finance ministry sees inflation at about 18 percent at the end of this year . - - Steven Silber + 48 22 653 9700

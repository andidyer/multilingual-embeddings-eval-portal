30 - year U . S . bond auction strong but prices fall . The U . S . Treasury ' s sale of $ 10 billion of 30 - year bonds attracted good bidding on Thursday but the market collapsed soon after the action results were announced and prices fell to session lows . The sale was the last leg of the Treasury ' s $ 38 billion three - part quarterly auction , which raises money to fund government operations and pay off maturing bonds . The Treasury said the bonds were sold with an average yield of 6 . 445 percent and that the difference between the highest yield and the average yield was less than one one - hundredth of a percent . The ratio of the bids received to those accepted was a strong 2 . 66 to one . A ratio of over 2 . 0 shows that the bidding was aggressive and the auction was successful . Bond prices firmed immediately after the auction results were announced but sellers quickly erased the gains and the market dropped to session lows . " The auction had positive features , " said Josh Stiles , I . D . E . A . senior bond strategist . " The 2 . 66 bid to cover was good . The average award was on the firm side of expectations . " The only negative aspect of the 30 - year bond auction was the follow through , said Stiles . " Apparently , some people bought it for a quick flipover , " he said , adding some dealers wanted to lighten up their positions before economic reports next week . " The squirrels ' cheeks are full of nuts here and they ' re looking for a place to bury them , " said Stiles . After the results were announced , the 30 - year Treasury fell 21 / 32 , or $ 6 . 56 on a $ 1 , 000 bond , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction , to 6 . 53 percent from 6 . 48 percent Wednesday . Stiles said the price retreat after the auction was part of the market digesting new supply and he said prices may rise again on Friday , sending yields lower . " It wouldn ' t surprise me if the bulls come out of the woodwork tomorrow or at least before Wednesday , " he said . Chris Rupkey , vice president and financial economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi , called the 30 - year auction result erratic . " The auction statistics were strong and we got a bounce on that , " he said . " But then we collapsed and made a new low on the day . And people are hard pressed to come up with an explanation . " Rupkey said in a refunding week , there is usually one auction that the market trips up on . " I guess this time it was the 30 - year , " he said .

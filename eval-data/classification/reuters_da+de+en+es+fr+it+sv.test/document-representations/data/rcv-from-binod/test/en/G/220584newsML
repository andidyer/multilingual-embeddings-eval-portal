Dhaka and Delhi to sign water accord next month . Bangladesh and India are expected to sign an accord in December ending their decades - old dispute over sharing water from the river Ganges , a foreign office spokesman said on Wednesday . Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will visit New Delhi next month , Ahmed Tareq Karim said . " Obviously the visit will take place for the signing of an agreement , " he told reporters after one - hour talks between Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad and the visiting Chief Minister of India ' s West Bengal state , Jyoti Basu . Basu arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday from Calcutta on a five - day visit for talks on the thorny river - sharing issue . Karim said Bangladesh was asking for a permanent agreement and " we are hopeful about it " . Indian officials , accompanying Basu , declined to comment . Basu told reporters on arrival that India was " sympathetic to Bangladesh ' s needs for water " . The Ganges , which flows into Bangladesh through India ' s West Bengal , has been a major irritant in relations between the two countries since 1974 when India built the Farakka barrage about 18 km ( 11 miles ) from Bangladesh ' s northern border . Dhaka says the barrage obstructs the river ' s flow during the dry season from December to May , depriving the downstream Bangladesh of its fair share of water . It claims that more than 40 million people in north and northwest Bangladesh have faced gradual desertification of their land because the dam dries up rivers fed by the mighty Ganges . The last agreement between the two neighbours , under which Bangladesh received 35 , 000 cubic metres per second of Ganges water during the dry season , expired in 1988 and attempts to renew it have failed . Karim said although any agreement would be between Dhaka and New Delhi , fruitful talks with West Bengal chief minister would be a " positive input in further discussion with New Delhi . " Bangladesh officials said Basu , whose CPM party is a major partner in Prime Minister Deve Gowda ' s coalition government , had a key role in the expected agreement . Bangladesh is Basu ' s ancestral home . His family migrated to West Bengal after British - ruled India was partitioned in 1947 , but still has a house in a village near Dhaka which he will visit on Thursday . Karim said Wednesday ' s talks were " very positive " and made " considerable progress " . He said further meetings would be held over the next three days . " We are progressing with a very positive attitude , " Ashim Dasgupta , finance minister of the West Bengal government , who is accompanying Basu , told reporters after the talks .

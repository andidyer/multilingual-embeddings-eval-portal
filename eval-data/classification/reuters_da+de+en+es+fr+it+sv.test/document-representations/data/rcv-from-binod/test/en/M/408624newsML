German shares end bourse just off record highs . German shares shrugged off overnight worries on Wall Street over the course of bourse trade on Thursday and rose to within striking distance of further record highs . The rise came on the back of a supportive dollar , which outweighed uncertainty in a moribund Bund market . Dealers said the rise was partly due to the market righting itself after falling on Wednesday after comments by U . S . Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan . The DAX index , which measures floor trade in 30 German blue - chips , ended up 38 . 85 points , or 1 . 20 percent , at 3 , 276 . 72 points , not far off a life high of 3 , 287 . 79 points . The Dow Jones Industrial Index on Wall street fell 0 . 78 percent overnight after Greenspan said the U . S . central bank was increasingly concerned about the impact on the economy of surging equity prices . " The dollar is the most important factor right now driving the market and that has a heavier impact than Greenspan , " said a trader at a Munich bank . The firmer dollar was sparking foreign interest in the market , particularly in chemical and carmaker shares . Despite the early gains , traders said the market advance would be capped by a weaker German debt market and reluctance to put on new positions ahead of Wall Street ' s opening . Among specific shares , Bayer AG was one of the top gainers , ending the session up 2 . 40 marks at 71 . 40 marks after the chemical and pharmaceuticals group said it had " a good dozen " products under development that would add from 10 billion marks in new sales . Karstadt AG ended up 21 . 50 marks at 552 . 50 marks after Germany ' s Wirtschaftwoche magazine said on Wednesday that major shareholders in the retailer wanted to replace Karstadt chief executive Walter Deuss . Traders noted Karstadt advanced despite expectations for the retailer to post a 1996 loss of nearly 300 million marks and plans to close more stores . Shares in truck manufacturer MAN AG slipped 8 . 50 marks to 434 marks after the group said it was aiming in its 1996 / 97 business year to earn a profit about equal to year - earlier results despite a drop in first - half profit . MAN said group net profit for the last six months of 1996 had fallen to 80 million marks from 110 million marks .

Clinton puts post - summit focus on domestic policy . Turning to domestic concerns after a weekend of summit diplomacy , President Clinton Monday helped raise money for a politically endangered Democratic senator and spotlighted programs to increase home ownership and health care . During a marathon workday that started in San Francisco and wound up in Los Angeles long after dark , Clinton attended three fund - raisers for Sen . Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat who expects to face a strong Republican challenge next year . Among those viewed as possible Boxer opponents are Rep . Sonny Bono , the former pop music and television star ; popular San Diego Mayor Susan Golding ; and a conservative California tycoon who made a fortune selling auto theft alarms . The fund - raisers , which also aided Clinton ' s Democratic Party , pumped about $ 1 million into Boxer ' s campaign treasury , officials said . " I ' m glad you ' re here for the kickoff , " Clinton told a partisan audience here after warning that Boxer ' s foes would try to create " a cardboard cookie cutout of who she really is " in the 1998 congressional election campaign . Clinton , who met over the weekend in Denver with leaders from Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan and Russia , waded into the political arena after addressing the U . S . Mayors Conference in San Francisco . " We have got to keep working until we extend the prosperity of this recovery to every neighborhood in America , " he said . The White House timed Clinton ' s speech to co - incide with the release of a federal report which found that cities face three key problems : urban unemployment remains higher than suburban and national rates ; the poor have become more concentrated in inner cities , and middle class flight from the cities continues . Clinton announced three measures to promote inner city home ownership : - - The Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) will launch a one - year program to encourage police to buy homes in neighborhoods where they work by letting them buy federally - foreclosed properties at a 50 percent discount . HUD hopes 1 , 000 police officers will take up the offer . - - The Federal Housing Administration will cut its mortgage insurance premiums by 25 basis points to 1 . 5 percent for first time homebuyers in the largest U . S . cities , saving them $ 200 on an average $ 85 , 000 mortgage . - - The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp . will begin a test program to help up to 2 , 000 low - income people buy homes by allowing them to use their federal rent subsidies for mortgage payments . HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters the three programs would cost the government $ 700 million annually and said the funds would come from within HUD ' s budget . The small - bore measures were characteristic of Clinton ' s second - term approach of promoting initiatives that require little new federal money at a time when the government is seeking to eliminate the budget deficit . Clinton later visited a Los Angeles school to announce that a private managed health care company , Kaiser Permanente , would spend $ 100 million to provide health care to up to 50 , 000 uninsured children in California . The not - for - profit company said it would spend the money over five years to fund insurance for children from low - income families as well as to sign up children who are eligible for state health insurance but are not enrolled .

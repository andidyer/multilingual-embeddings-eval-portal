Australia defends decision to attend HK ceremony . Australia on Friday defended its decision to break ranks with the United States and Britain and attend the inauguration of Hong Kong ' s new Beijing - appointed legislature on July 1 . Fending off criticism from the Labor opposition , Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Australia accepted China ' s promise to hold democratic elections within a year of regaining control of Hong Kong on July 1 . " In Hong Kong we have every expectation that there will be free and fair elections during the course of the next 12 months , " he told reporters . The appointed provisional legislature , replacing the elected chamber that Britain established in Hong Kong , will be sworn in on July 1 as soon as China resumes control of the territory after 156 years of British rule . The United States said on Tuesday that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would attend the handover ceremony but not the swearing - in of the legislature . Britain followed on Wednesday by saying Prime Minister Tony Blair would also miss the legislature ceremony . But Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Thursday that Australia would attend the ceremony because it needed to maintain a good economic relationship with China . Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said that amounted to the Liberal - National government giving up on Australia ' s moral standards . " Now if you don ' t , as a country with our sort of background , make stands on these issues from time to time , then you put a big question mark over your moral values and commitment , " he told reporters . Downer said Australia would take China ' s word unless and until it was broken . " If that commitment ( for elections ) that China has already made is . . . breached then that will create great international outrage and we would be part of that international outrage , " he said . " But I am satisfied , as of now , China is determined to proceed with fair and free elections in Hong Kong . " Australia has already broken ranks with its American allies over Canberra ' s decision in April not to support a U . N . motion censuring Beijing for human rights abuses . The motion , at the U . N . Human Rights Commission in Geneva , failed for the seventh successive year . Instead , Howard agreed with Chinese leaders to set up an unprecedented formal human rights dialogue , due to start in Beijing in August .

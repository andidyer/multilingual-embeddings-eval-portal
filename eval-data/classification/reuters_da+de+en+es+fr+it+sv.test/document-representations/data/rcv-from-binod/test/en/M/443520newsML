IPE Brent holds gains ahead of April expiry . IPE Brent crude oil futures held on to earlier gains as traders jockeyed for positions ahead of the expiry today of the April contract , traders said . April Brent was trading at $ 20 . 14 a barrel at 1310 GMT , 25 cents firmer , while May was 22 cents up at $ 19 . 64 . April IPE gas oil was only 25 cents a tonne firmer at $ 169 . 50 . " It is the death throes of April , " one IPE dealer said . " And I think people are still a little nervous about the shortage of physical cargoes in April . " Markets rose on Thursday after news that April ' s Brent loading programme would be eight cargoes lighter than March , and traders said the strength on Friday was partly a follow - through from that . The April / May spread on IPE Brent has ballooned out to 48 cents , compared with just a few cents at one point earlier in the week . Spreads further forward were also wider , with May / June out at around + 12 cents compared with seven or eight yesterday . Gas oil , however , was not so bullish and brokers said in the absence of weather - related or other fundamental factors prices had little reason to budge . - - Nicholas Shaxson , London newsroom + 44 171 542 8167

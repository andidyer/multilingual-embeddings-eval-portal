Fuel boat gets to Freetown , but without petrol . A boat flying the Panama flag has beaten a West African blockade to reach Sierra Leone , but it was carrying only fuel for generators , not petrol , oil industry sources said on Sunday . Sierra Leone ' s neighbours have blockaded the country in an attempt to force the military junta that seized power in May to hand power back to elected civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah . Military officials last week assured Sierra Leoneans that a shipment of petrol was on its way , but people waiting on the dockside were disappointed when the ship , belonging to the Rosy Peak shipping company in Hong Kong , docked on Saturday . " The ship has brought only marine fuel oil , or what is known as black oil for electricity powerhouses and generators , not the much - needed petrol , " an oil industry source said . " There is not even a tea - cup of petrol left in the tanks of Mobil or NP ( National Petroleum Company ) , " the source added . There are few taxis on the road in Freetown and most people are having to walk everywhere . Petrol on the black market is said to be three times the pre - coup cost . Power cuts have become the norm , but oil industry source said the weekend shipment of black oil would not do much to improve that situation . " There was already some black oil in the city . The main problem with the powerhouses , which is responsible for the blackouts , its that they have run short of lubricants for the engines and cooling oil to cool the engines , " one source said . Leaders of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) said they would tighten the blockade after the junta defiantly said last month it would stay in power until 2001 , scuppering peace talks . The first vessel to beat the sea blockade , a Russian - registered ship carrying 6 , 800 tonnes of rice , docked in Freetown on July 31 to scenes of jubilation on the quayside . ECOWAS troops under Nigerian command are in control of the main airport and have sealed land borders .

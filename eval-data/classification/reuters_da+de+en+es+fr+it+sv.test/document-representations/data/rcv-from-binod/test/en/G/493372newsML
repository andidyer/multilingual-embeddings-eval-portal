Slovenia says its NATO bid is widely supported . Slovenia ' s participation in the first wave of NATO enlargement is uncertain but its membership ambitions enjoy wide support within the alliance , the Slovenian foreign minister said on Tuesday . " At this moment it is very difficult to say what Slovenia ' s chances are , " Zoran Thaler told a news conference following talks with his Hungarian counterpart , Laszlo Kovacs . " But we will do everything to become members in the first wave , " he added . Spanish government sources said recently that the U . S . and Spain agreed that Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic should be invited to join NATO at July ' s Madrid summit and Slovenia and Romania should also be considered for membership . Thaler said Slovenia met all the criteria to join NATO and was also able to pay its way . " It is becoming an important argument that Slovenia is able to finance its NATO membership , " he added . He said that Italy , the only NATO member having a joint border with Slovenia , supported Slovenia ' s joining the organisation , as well as NATO members Canada and Spain . " We receive strong support from the U . S . administration also , " he added . " And what is most important , there is no member country which raised objections to Slovenia ' s NATO memberhip . " Kovacs said Slovenia should join NATO as quickly as possible . " Hungary agrees that Slovenia should become a NATO member as soon as possible , " he said . " Slovenia ' s quick joining would be an important factor of the stability of the region . " Slovenia would be Hungary ' s only geographical link with other western European NATO members if both countries joined the organisation . The foreign ministers held talks about tightening the two countries ' economic and political relations , as well as their trilateral cooperation with Italy and Austria . Kovacs said top politicians of Slovenia and Hungary would further intensify talks in the near future , with Slovenian president Milan Kucan visiting Budapest on April 29 and 30 , and the Hungarian , Slovenian and Italian prime ministers meeting at end - May , also in Budapest .

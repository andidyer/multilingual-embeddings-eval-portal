SOCCER SHOWCASE - RONALDO DOUBLE SINKS PARAGUAY . Brazil striker Ronaldo scored two goals but missed a penalty as the world champions beat Paraguay 2 - 0 in their Copa America quarter - final Sunday . Ronaldo ' s two excellently taken first half goals set Brazil on the way to a semi - final meeting with Peru but he had his second - half penalty saved by Jose Luis Chilavert , the self - proclaimed best goalkeeper in the world . Ronaldo ' s killer touch was the difference between the two sides in an even match . Paraguay , who lead the South American World Cup qualifying competition , had long periods of possession , created a number of good chances but could not put the ball in the net . The match had been billed as a personal duel between Ronaldo , generally regarded as the world ' s best player , and the volatile , outspoken Paraguayan captain , who has made his name by regularly scoring from free kicks and penalties . The 20 - year - old striker , whose form in Brazil ' s last two games seemed to be affected by the uncertainty over his club future , took his goal tally in the Copa to four , one less than leading scorer Luis Hernandez of Mexico . The first goal , in the 17th minute , was typical Ronaldo . He won the ball from Arnaldo Espinola near the halfway line , burst clear of the defence with an explosive piece of acceleration and rifled the ball into the top corner with a shot that gave Chilavert no chance . Seventeen minutes later , Denilson slipped an intelligent pass between two Paraguayan defenders to find Ronaldo in an unmarked position on the edge of the penalty area . There seemed little doubt at that point that he would score again and Ronaldo duly obliged with another fulminating drive which again left Chilavert stranded . He was on for a hat - trick midway through the second half after a penalty awarded for a foul on him by Chilavert as the two tussled for the ball . Chilavert protested angrily that Ronaldo had dived and was booked for dissent but had the last laugh when he dived to his left to brilliantly save Ronaldo ' s effort from the spot . Chilavert had two attempts at his trademark free kicks , both in the second half but one went into the Brazilian wall and the other went horribly wide . But Chilavert ' s general ranting appeared to motivate his team mates in the second half and he produced the biggest cheer from the crowd when he rushed out of his penalty and dribbled the ball past Brazil ' s Leonardo . His long and remarkably accurate goal kicks were one of his team ' s most potent attacking weapons . " We had a lot of injuries and fielded five inexperienced players , " said Paraguay ' s Brazilian coach Paulo Cesar Carpegiani . " If we had been at full strength the game could have been harder . " Chilavert said : " Brazil won on our errors . They took advantage of our mistakes and scored two goals in the first half hour . " Brazil were a disappointment and seemed uninterested in putting on a show . Rather than using the full individual talent of his players , Brazil coach Mario Zagallo based Brazil ' s game on getting behind the ball when Paraguay had possession , closing down their opponents and catching them on the counter - attack . Paraguay were severely hampered by the absence of key defender Celso Ayala , who plays in Argentina for River Plate . Francisco Arce , who plays for Brazilian club Gremio , twice came close for Paraguay in the first half with free kicks from around 30 metres . The first took a deflection off the Brazil wall but was well - saved by Taffarel , and the second flew a hair ' s breadth wide of the Brazil upright . Taffarel also had to be alert to stop a long - range effort by Roberto Acuna shortly before Brazil ' s first goal . At the other end , Romario was guilty of an amazing miss in the opening minutes when he headed the ball over an empty goal from six metres after a cross eluded the Paraguay defence . Carpegiani made two changes after the second goal in an attempt to reorganise his defence , replacing Arnaldo Espinola with Juan Ramon Jara and striker Derlis Soto with Jose Cardozo . The second half continued in the same vein with Brazil happy to sit back and catch Paraguay on the break . In the first quarter of a hour , Arce fired another free kick narrowly over the goal , while Aristides Rojas missed an excellent chance to reduce the deficit when he fired over from the same position that Ronaldo had scored in the first half . Paraguay missed another excellent chance near the end while Roberto Carlos struck the post with a thunderous volley from outside the penalty area .

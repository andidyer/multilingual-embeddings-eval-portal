NATO invites old communist foes to join alliance . NATO leaders , in an historic move to erase Europe ' s Cold War division , invited Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the alliance on Tuesday and held out real membership prospects to other former communist states . A NATO summit climaxed a day of wrangling by reassuring Slovenia , Romania and the Baltic states that they would be considered seriously in future expansions and pledged that all the new democracies had the right to join the defence body . " Today the heads of state and government have agreed to invite the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland to begin accession talks with NATO , " Secretary - General Javier Solana told assembled leaders and world media . NATO ' s 16 leaders endorsed the biggest expansion in the alliance ' s 48 - year history after France , which led a bloc of seven states urging a wider enlargement , won assurances the door would be left open and the situation reviewed in two years . French President Jacques Chirac , who twice insisted on changes to the final communique , was warmly applauded by Romanian journalists when he arrived for a post - summit press conference . " That ' s the least I can expect , " he beamed , adding that he was satisfied with the final outcome . " There were some difficulties but finally we got a clear perspective set out in a single paragraph which sets the date 1999 and specifically names just two countries , Romania and Slovenia , " the French president said . Solana said the allies ' goal was to admit formally the new members in April 1999 on the occasion of the alliance ' s 50th anniversary and mentioned Slovenia and Romania as prime candidates for the next round of expansion . Braving Moscow ' s wrath , the official declaration also gave favourable mention to the Baltic states as " aspiring members " without specifically naming the former Soviet republics of Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia . " We recognize the progress achieved towards greater stability and cooperation by the states in the Baltic region who are also aspiring members , " the declaration said . Solana stressed that NATO remained " open to new members " and expected to extend further invitations in coming years as NATO seought to cement a post - Cold War European security order to keep the continent at peace in the 21st century . President Bill Clinton told reporters the invitation marked a " giant stride " towards a new Europe that was undivided , democratic and at peace . During one of the most contentious NATO summits for years , France and Italy argued strongly the inclusion of Romania and Slovenia would inject stability into some of Europe ' s most turbulent zones , the Balkans and the edge of the Black Sea . But Clinton , keenly aware he has to have expansion ratified by a sceptical Republican - led U . S . Congress , said only the three leading candidates were currently ready to meet all the responsibilities of membership . " They have met the highest standards of democratic and market reform . They have pursued those reforms long enough to give us confidence they are irreversible , just as our offer of NATO membership is irreversible , " Clinton told fellow leaders . The U . S . administration is bracing itself for tough questions over how much expansion - - the centrepiece of Clinton ' s foreign policy - - will cost and about the wisdom of extending America ' s nuclear defence shield to cover three more European states . Article V of NATO ' s 1949 founding Washington treaty commits each country to treat an attack on one of them as an attack on all of them , effectively placing the Europeans under U . S . protection - - a long - dreamt goal of Moscow ' s former satellites . While key aides frantically worked on the " open door " language , Clinton and Chirac engaged in animated , finger - wagging exchanges while other heads of state and government milled aimlessly around the conference centre . Clinton was backed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and four other leaders , concerned too rapid an expansion could make the most powerful military alliance ever assembled unwieldly and ineffective . German aides said Chancellor Helmut Kohl , a strong ally of both countries , was instrumental in bridging the gap between the opposing camps and helping to find the compromise wording . Russia has warned that it would consider NATO membership by the Baltic republics , which have substantial Russian minorities , as a threat to its own security . It condemned Tuesday ' s enlargement announcement by its former Cold War foe as " the biggest mistake in Europe since the end of World War Two " . Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Moscow had not changed its position despite signing a new cooperation accord with NATO last May by which it grudgingly accepted it was powerless to stop the process . " Regarding the question of NATO expansion , I can only say that we confirm our stand , " Primakov told reporters in Moscow . But Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski was delighted . " After this decision , Europe will be more secure and it ' s a good decision for Poland , " he told Reuters , after waiting all afternoon in a hotel across town for the phone call from Solana . NATO ' s enlargement decision is likely to increase pressure on the European Union to speed up its own eastwards expansion as a way of softening the blow to unsuccessful alliance applicants .

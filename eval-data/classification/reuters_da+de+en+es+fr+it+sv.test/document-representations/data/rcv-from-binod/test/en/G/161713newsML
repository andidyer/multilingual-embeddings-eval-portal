LEADING CANDIDATES IN ROMANIA PRESIDENTIAL POLLS . Opinion polls suggest Romania ' s President Ion Iliescu , in power since communism ended in 1989 , will secure most votes in Sunday ' s presidential election . But his main rivals , Emil Constantinescu and Petre Roman , have been catching up and Iliescu is unlikely to win an outright majority and avoid a run - off election on November 17 . There are 16 presidential candidates in all . Here are profiles of the top three men . ION ILIESCU , 66 , President of Romania , is a veteran communist who won power by masterminding the ousting of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the 1989 revolution . He was confirmed as president by a landslide 85 percent in elections in May 1990 and re - elected in September 1992 . Moscow - educated Iliescu is the candidate of the leftist Party of Social Democracy , descendents of the communists . Iliescu says he offers his country a western outlook , stability and a programme of cautious economic reform that will protect Romanians from the pain of change . His opponents say the man who was once heir apparent to Ceausescu is a remnant of an old order which is mired in corruption . They say he lacks the vision to guide Romania into the next century . Iliescu has moved to the political centre in recent years . But his foes recall the violent coal miners riots of 1990 and 1991 , which toppled reformist Prime Minister Petre Roman , and say it is evidence of an authoritarian streak . His opinion poll ratings range from 31 to 37 percent . - - - - - EMIL CONSTANTINESCU , 56 , main rival to Iliescu , is the candidate of the Democratic Convention ( CDR ) , a centrist opposition alliance . A top geologist and law faculty graduate , he rose to political prominence because of his untarnished reputation . He draws most of his support from Romania ' s big towns and cities . Although Constantinescu had little experience of top - level politics and was soundly beaten by Iliescu in 1992 he has grown in self - confidence during the 1996 campaign . Slim , soft - spoken and bearded , he was among teachers who joined students on the streets in the December 1989 revolution . He also joined a protest movement which was bloodily crushed by pro - Iliescu coalminers in June 1990 . Constantinescu ' s American - style " Contract with Romania " promises swifter social , economic and political reforms , guarantees of the rule of law and a fierce attack on corruption and abuse of privilege . Opinion polls give Constantinescu from 20 to 28 percent , although his CDR is more popular than Iliescu ' s PDSR . - - - - PETRE ROMAN , 50 , Romania ' s first post - communist prime minister , was sacked by Iliescu after a second set of anti - reform riots by coalminers in 1991 , and now challenges his former chief . Roman , a charismatic former hydraulics professor who speaks fluent English , French and Spanish , has refrained from attacking Iliescu personally , despite a legacy of bitterness . Relations are cool , as they are with Constantinescu . The outward - looking , dynamic reformer appeals to younger voters , entrepreneurs and investors , and promises to create new jobs by boosting investment and fighting inflation . His party , the Social Democratic Union ( USD ) , may hold the balance of power in the next parliament . Opinion polls give Roman from 18 to 24 percent . REUTER

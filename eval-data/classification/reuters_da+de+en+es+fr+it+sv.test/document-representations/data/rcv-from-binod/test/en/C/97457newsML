India ' s oil costs soar , but price hike unlikely . India is unlikely to announce a second hike in petroleum product prices this year despite ballooning subsidies caused by a shortfall in domestic oil production and higher consumption , analysts said on Friday . " It ( a fresh price hike ) is most unlikely , " said Manish Singhal , analyst at Caspian Securities in Bombay . A top official at state - run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( HPCL ) , agreed , saying a fresh price rise would be too much for the government to handle . In July , the government effected steep price increases for major petroleum products , but later reduced them to an average 12 percent following widespread protests . Speculation of a fresh increase in prices was rife after the Petroleum Ministry last month forecast the oil pool account deficit would rise to 130 billion rupees ( $ 3 . 6 billion ) for 1996 - 97 ( April - March ) . This was more than twice the earlier projection of about 60 billion . The oil pool manages the state subsidy . Analysts agree the oil pool deficit will widen this year , but most believe the figure of 130 billion rupees is exaggerated . " It looks like the Petroleum Ministry ' s ploy to expedite decontrol , which it has been aggressively advocating , " said an analyst at a private Bombay - based think - tank . Most analysts say the deficit could rise to 80 to 90 billion rupees this year , up from about 60 billion projected after the July price increase . The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) , which accounts for about 90 percent of India ' s oil output , is expected to produce about 29 million tonnes of oil this year , down from 31 . 5 million tonnes last year , forcing more imports of crude and petroleum products . Lower domestic production translates into costlier imports because the government pays ONGC a much lower price than the international crude price . Production at Indian refineries have risen . So have imports in value and quantity terms , oil analysts said .

Bonn , eastern states to split debt repayment . Germany ' s federal , state and local governments have reached a compromise on repayment of 8 . 4 billion marks ( $ 5 . 51 billion ) in communist - period east German debt , Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl said on Wednesday . The principal will be absorbed by the federal government ' s standing programme for servicing east German debt , while the 630 million marks in annual debt service payments will be shared equally by Bonn and the east German states . The federal government pledged not to finance its share in a way that would disadvantage the eastern states , which fear Bonn might reduce other forms of aid . The states said they would present within one month a plan on how they would finance their share of the interest . The dispute over who should repay the debt has been simmering for a year . The funds were originally disbursed by the defunct East German government for the construction of schools , sports facilities and other public projects . Local governments claimed the debts were a product of specious socialist bookkeeping and might never have had to be repaid if Germany had not been reunified . - - Terence Gallagher , Bonn newsroom , 49 228 26097150 ( $ 1 = 1 . 5250 Mark )

U . S . envoy starts off talks with Israeli PM . U . S . Middle East envoy Dennis Ross met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday in efforts to push forward talks with the PLO on a partial Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , witnesses said . Ross , who in October was unable to broker an accord on the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron in the West Bank , arrived in Israel late on Saturday and travelled to Jerusalem for the meeting at Netanyahu ' s home . He was expected later on Saturday to meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , who on Friday said : " The most important thing is that Mr Ross has to be an accurate mediator and not to be biased on the side of Israel . " The trip by Ross had sparked some concern among Palestinian officials that the U . S . envoy might favour Israel , which is strongly supported by the United States . " We want him ( Ross ) to be on the side of the agreement , not on the side of Israel , " PLO official Hassan Asfour told Reuters . U . S . Secretary of State Warren Christopher ' s comments on Thursday that Palestinians had to make concessions on Hebron irked PLO leaders and others . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Saturday that Israel must make concessions in peace talks before telling Palestinians to abandon their demands , rejecting the U . S . view of the dispute . " If there are any concession made by Israel , we would like to know them , " Mubarak told reporters a day after his talks with Arafat . " Arafat was here and I did not understand from him that there were any concessions " . " Israel says they have made concessions and the Palestinians must do so , " Mubarak said of Christopher ' s comments . " What can the Palestinians concede ? They don ' t have anything . Does Israel want them to concede their dignity , their land , the right to protect their people ? " Israelis and Palestinians accuse each other of foot - dragging in talks on Hebron , where about 400 militant Jewish settlers live among 100 , 000 Arabs . The U . S . administration last sent Ross after clashes in September in the West Bank and Gaza killed 15 Israeli soldiers and 60 Palestinians . He left after his three - week mediation effort collapsed but said the sides had narrowed the gaps . The United States , sponsor of Israeli - Arab peace talks launched in 1991 , has pressed Israelis and Palestinians to finalise their accord on Hebron and move on to negotiations on an overall peace deal . The withdrawal deal on Hebron had been agreed upon between the PLO and the liberal Labour government that Netanyahu unseated in May elections , but Labour had put off implementation after a series of suicide bombings in Israel by Islamic militants . Hundreds of Arabs gathered in central Hebron on Saturday after Jewish settlers scuffled with Palestinian school children in the town , a flashpoint of Arab - Israeli violence . Soldiers intervened , arresting at least two Palestinians and clearing demonstrators from the approach to one of the Jewish enclaves in Hebron .

Anglo - Irish talks on N . Ireland postponed . Anglo - Irish ministerial talks on the Northern Ireland peace process were postponed at the last minute on Wednesday due to " scheduling difficulties " . Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring were to have had their first bilateral talks of 1997 . " We are in the process of trying to fix another date , " an Irish official said . A British source said the meeting might be held over until next week . The talks , aimed at addressing an array of problems plaguing the peace process , were planned against a background of growing political instability , increased guerrilla tension and sectarian bitterness in the British - ruled province . A wave of attacks by the Irish Republican Army , which draws support from some of the Catholic minority opposed to British rule , has dashed hope of an early end to 28 years of turmoil . Indeed , multi - party talks on the province ' s future have made little headway since their launch last June under the chairmanship of former U . S . Senator George Mitchell . Britain and Ireland , the talks ' sponsors , say that Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA , will be allowed in if the guerrillas call a truce . The outlawed group says that Britain must guarantee Sinn Fein ' s unconditional , immediate entry to the talks before it will countenance calling off its long - running war against British rule .

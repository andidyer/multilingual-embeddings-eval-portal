Strong holiday weekend helps U . S . retailer shares . Retail stocks strengthened Monday on expectations of better than expected fourth quarter results due to strong holiday sales but heavy consumer debt could dampen the trend before spring . " Investors are relieved to hear the shopping season is off to a good start , " N . Richard Nelson Jr , retailing analyst at Nesbitt Burns , said . " So far so good . The early scorecards are encouraging . " " We ' ll see a nice top line growth rate and strong earnings on the part of most retailers , " Saul Yaari , senior retailing analyst at Piper Jaffray , said , noting that retailers have an easy comparison from last year ' s weak results . " The companies are telling everyone they are a little bit ahead of internal plans , " Yaari said . Shares of most major retailers were up slightly from Friday ' s close . Sears , Roebuck & Co shares gained 1 - 1 / 2 points to 51 - 1 / 4 , while Federated Department Stores Inc and Gap Inc each gained one point to trade at 35 - 1 / 8 and 33 - 1 / 8 , respectively . Richard Giss , a partner at Deloitte & Touche ' s retail services group , said 464 different retailers in their annual " Mood Survey : Retail Holiday Outlook " expect an average increase in profits of 7 . 02 percent , compared with 3 . 5 percent in profit growth for the holiday season a year ago . The holiday season is crucial for retailers since 25 percent of an average shop ' s profits for the year are derived from the holidays , with some retailers , such as gift shops , deriving as much as 40 percent of their profits from the period , Giss said . A strong job market , growing personal incomes and high consumer confidence are inspiring much of the increased spending , analysts said . But high consumer debt as a percentage of income is the leading factor that offsets the favorable conditions , analysts said . The debt loads could cause some " retrenchment " or a slowdown of retail spending in spring as shoppers attempt to payoff their credit card bills from the holidays , Yaari said . Peter Schaeffer , an analyst at Dillon Read , said he is less bullish , because many of the economic conditions behind the weak holiday last year are still present . " It ' ll be a good Christmas , but not a great Christmas , " Schaeffer said . Too many people are underemployed and , despite a good job market , job security is not too evident , he said . He also noted the tendency of retailers to " exaggerate " holiday figures , but Thursday ' s reports of retail sales for November should give a clearer figure . Toys , jewelry and high - end apparel should show strong sales growth , analysts said . Consumer electronics and furniture will be weak sectors and furnishing and shoes will finish up slightly , Yaari said . Last year , sharp markdowns after a weak October 1995 sales led to a weak retailing holiday season last year and hurt fourth quarter profits , Yaari said . Yaari said leaner inventories have helped retailers limit their markdowns this year - - a move that should improve profitability . Discounters should show some strength , but not as much as department stores , which focus upon higher - margin apparel sales more than discounters , Nelson said . " I think if these companies meet or beat the consensus forecasts , the stocks should be good performers through spring 1997 , " Nelson said .

Yeltsin gets good economic news a year into term . Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Wednesday that Russia ' s gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the broadest measure of economic health , had risen for the first time since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 . The surprise jump in GDP capped a day of good economic news for President Boris Yeltsin and gave him cause for optimism at the end of a difficult first year in his second four - year term . " This ( rise ) has happened for the first time in five years of reforms , " Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying in an announcement of growth of more than one percent . Analysts treated the statement with caution , however , after a string of monthly figures showing more stability than growth . " On the whole , we have finished the half - year with positive results , " Chernomyrdin told Yeltsin earlier on Wednesday . Other encouraging signs included a surge in share prices . The Russian Trading System index of 22 shares hit a record 447 . 94 close on a record $ 100 . 27 million market turnover . Agricultural analysts also offered a fillip by saying Russia ' s grain harvest would probably exceed Moscow ' s official forecasts this year , making imports less likely . Yeltsin did not let Chernomyrdin rest on his laurels . He told the government it must deal with its next task by ending wage arrears to the army within two months and to other public sector workers , such as teachers , within three months . It is a tall order . Wage arrears to the military amount to five trillion roubles ( $ 860 million ) , and the state ' s total debt to the army is calculated at tens of trillions of roubles . Yeltsin also acted decisively in the political sphere by sacking justice minister Valentin Kovalyov , who was allegedly filmed in a gangland sauna with naked women . He replaced him with old ally Sergei Stepashin , an ex - security service chief . Kovalyov ' s dismissal removed the last communist from the government . Yeltsin had sacked the only other communist , Aman Tuleyev , as Minister for Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) Affairs on Tuesday . Yeltsin ' s no - nonsense actions encapsulated the strength and resolve of the 66 - year - old Kremlin leader one year after he beat off a communist candidate to secure re - election . He has taken a firm grip on power since recovering from the heart trouble which forced him out of the Kremlin until February and put his leadership in question . Chernomyrdin announced the rise in GDP - - the total value of goods and services produced - - in the first half of this year at a science awards ceremony . He gave no basis for his calculation . Official statistics showed a fall in GDP for the first five months . Many Russian officials have predicted flat output in 1997 and forecast no growth until next year , although many feel official figures underplay thriving service sector businesses . A rise in GDP would be a big boost for the reformist team which Yeltsin created under a cabinet reshuffle in February and March , but analysts played down the likely stock market impact . " Yes , it could be done , but the market tends not to move on GDP , " said CentreInvest Securities research chief James Fenkner . Yeltsin and the government still face many problems . A spokeswoman for Russia ' s Supreme Court said a 25 - year - old Moscow lawyer was trying to sue Yeltsin for illegal nepotism after he appointed his daughter , Tatyana Dyachenko , as an official adviser on Monday . The Kremlin denies any wrongdoing . Nuclear power station workers are preparing for a 350 - km ( 220 - mile ) protest march to Moscow to demand four months of unpaid wages , Interfax said . The government also says its efforts are hindered by the communist - led State Duma , the lower house of parliament , which has opposed efforts to cut budget spending and social benefits . The Duma is on holiday until September 1 and deputies have resisted efforts to break their holiday to pass urgently needed reform legislation . Yeltsin is likely to raise the issue when he meets communist Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov on Friday .

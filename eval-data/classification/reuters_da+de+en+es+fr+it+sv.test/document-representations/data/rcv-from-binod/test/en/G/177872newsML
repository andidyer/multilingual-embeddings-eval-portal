Suu Kyi ' s motorcade stoned in Rangoon . A motorcade taking Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to meet supporters near her home was attacked by a group throwing stones , she said on Saturday . Suu Kyi , who was unhurt in the incident on Saturday afternoon , later told reporters the attack might have been orchestrated by the Burmese authorities , and criticised the ruling military government for allowing it to happen . A government official confirmed the incident and said the authorities were investigating . He said a government security officer in Suu Kyi ' s motorcade had waved his pistol in the air to disperse the stone - throwers . The official said the attack must have been launched by people who objected to Suu Kyi ' s policies or activities . The Nobel laureate and the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) have been engaged in a standoff over her demand for greater democracy in Burma since her release from six years of house arrest last July . The SLORC has detained and later released hundreds of her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party supporters and members at various times in what was seen as an attempt to put pressure on her to curb her activities . Suu Kyi said the motorcade came under attack in the late afternoon as it was leaving the house of U Kyi Maung , deputy president of her NLD , less than a mile ( one and a half kms ) from her home . The stones smashed the windshields of three cars carrying NLD vice chairman U Tin Oo , security officials and police . After the incident Suu Kyi met several hundred supporters who had waited near checkpoints set up by police to bar public access to her residence . The barriers were aimed at preventing her from holding her regular weekend public gatherings for the seventh consecutive week , NLD sources said . She spoke to her supporters briefly and asked them to return home peacefully , without mentioning the stone - throwing incident , witnesses said . Suu Kyi charged that uniformed security officers stationed in the area had done nothing to stop the stone throwers . " It was very obvious that these people were stationed there at the sanction of the authorities , " she said . " These uniformed people did not lift a finger to stop the attackers . The whole thing was carefully orchestrated by the authorities . What kind of government is it that allows such hooliganism , " she added .

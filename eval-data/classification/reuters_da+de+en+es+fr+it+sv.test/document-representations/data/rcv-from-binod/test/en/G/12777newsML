U . S . says Albania must give opposition a role . The United States has called on Albania ' s ruling conservative Democrats to offer a bigger role to opposition parties in preparing local elections after a a national poll in May was boycotted by the opposition . " The United States government calls for broadening the political dialogue in Albania between the ruling and opposition parties as the first step toward holding free and fair local elections , adopting a new constitution and holding new parliamentary elections at the earliest opportunity , " a State Department statement said . The statement , issued on Friday , said the United States believed that the ruling Democratic party must do more to reach out to the opposition parties , offering them a substantive role in preparing for local elections and in the make - up of an electoral commission . Most opposition groups , citing fears of a biased electoral process , have threatened to boycott the nationwide local ballot on October 20 , five months after a disputed general election cast a shadow over the ex - communist country ' s young democracy . Albanian President Sali Berisha , a Democrat , earlier this month set up a 17 - member permanent commission to organise future ballots , including the local polls in October . Foreign governments have indicated they will watch the polls closely as a test of Albania ' s commitment to democracy . The commission ' s membership is based on the performance of all political parties in the last local election in 1992 , but the opposition said it was biased in favour of the ruling party and was not subject to adequate regulation . The main opposition Socialist Party , reformed heirs to the communists , have vowed that they will not take part in the commission . The U . S . State Department called on opposition parties to participate fully in the election process , however . " We recommend an inclusive formula for participation in future round table discussions , " the statement said .

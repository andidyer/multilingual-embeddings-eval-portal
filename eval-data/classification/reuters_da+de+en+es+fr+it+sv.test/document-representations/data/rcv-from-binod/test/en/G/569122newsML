Kinkel visits Bosnia amid row with German states . German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel travelled to Sarajevo on Thursday to discuss the repatriation of Bosnian refugees although German state interior ministers dismissed the trip as a waste of time . Kinkel planned to hold talks with U . N . relief officials and members of Bosnia ' s collective presidency to coordinate plans for the repatriation of refugees who fled to Germany during the Yugoslav conflict . German state interior ministers declined to accompany Kinkel because they said without the participation of Germany ' s Interior Minister Manfred Kanther nothing significant could be accomplished . A spokesman for Kinkel criticised the state ministers for pulling out of the trip , saying they were " hiding behind " Kanther . Kinkel has slammed Germany ' s 16 states for deciding last year to compel refugees to return to their war - ravaged country if they failed to leave voluntarily . The foreign minister has urged the states to come up with a unified plan to return refugees in a humane way . International human rights workers and Bosnian government officials have condemned Germany for forcing some refugees back without ensuring they could return to their home towns safely . Some Moslem refugees who were deported had no chance of returning to their homes which now lie in territory controlled by nationalist Serb authorities , U . N . relief officials said . During the 1992 - 95 war , Germany accepted some 320 , 000 refugees from former Yugoslavia , more than the rest of the European Union . But German states , complaining the Bosnians were becoming a financial burden , announced plans last year to deport between 70 , 000 to 90 , 000 refugees . Relief workers and diplomats say there is little chance that refugees would be allowed to return to places where they might challenge local ethnic dominance established during the war .

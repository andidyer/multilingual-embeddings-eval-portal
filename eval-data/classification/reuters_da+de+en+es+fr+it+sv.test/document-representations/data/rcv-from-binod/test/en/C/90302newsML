MCI unveils one - number for business users . MCI Communications Corp said that it unveiled an advanced one - number service to replace multiple phone numbers for telephones , cellular phones , paging , fax and voice mail with a single toll - free access number . The service , called directlineMCI , is a single - number communications service that provides coverage throughout the U . S . Subscribers can route how they receive the calls to this one - number service to any one of three domestic or international telephone options - - to voice mail , to a pager or a fax mailbox . Messages can be received immediately or at another time . MCI said the service is available beginning today . MCI said that each directlineMCI subscriber is assigned a unique toll - free access number and the subscriber establishes a desired routing plan for incoming calls . The subscriber determines where calls are sent , which can be changed anytime . " Instead of having six different numbers on your business card , you can have one 800 number for people to reach you , " said an MCI spokesman . " It ' s a management tool to help control information overload . " MCI said that caller ID service is also included , and users can choose to answer the call or have it sent to voice mail . For example , MCI said it will charge a flat rate of $ 0 . 20 per incoming call , per minute . An MCI spokesman said that the announcement was not in reaction to the announcement earlier by AT & T Corp . AT & T announced Wednesday a new service which combines voice , messaging and paging communications in a single digital telephone , which is also purchased from AT & T . " This was a planned , single - number service , " said the MCI spokesman . " It provides subscribers with a lot of flexibility . "

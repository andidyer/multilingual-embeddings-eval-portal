Weaker Q2 results seen for Canada energy companies . Second - quarter results in Canada ' s oil and gas industry were expected to lag those of the year ' s stellar first quarter amid weaker commodity prices and rising operating costs , analysts said . Lower financial and production expectations and falling oil prices were already resulting in a pullback in stock prices , which had gushed to an all - time high in late May . " Producers are experiencing cost pressures and a margin squeeze because of lower oil and gas prices , " said Robert Hinckley , analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co in New York . " It ' s going to make the second quarter look considerably down from the first quarter , and perhaps down from the second quarter of last year . " The exceptions were expected to be the country ' s four integrated companies - - Imperial Oil Ltd , Petro - Canada , Shell Canada Ltd and Suncor Energy Inc - - whose healthy refining and marketing operations have cushioned the upstream blow . Major Canadian energy firms are slated to start pumping out quarterly results this week , starting with Suncor on Thursday and Alberta Energy Co Ltd on Friday . Hinckley said booming drilling activity in western Canada has led to a squeeze on rigs and other oilfield services which has meant a jump in costs across the sector . " You ' re getting oilfield inflation now for the first time in quite a while and I think a lot of the cost components are going up 15 - 20 percent a year , " he said . On top of that , you ' ve had a big land rush up there - - everybody ' s built their land position ahead of what they view as fairly active exploration and that ' s a front - end cost that has to be borne . " Oil prices and weather did not help . West Texas Intermediate crude oil has traded mostly between US $ 19 and US $ 20 a barrel for most of the past month and a half , after reaching over US $ 22 in May . A long spring breakup in Canada , when melting snow severely curtails access to operations sites , also threw a monkey wrench into corporate plans , analysts said . In addition to suggesting weaker average results , these negative factors have also made investors jittery . The Toronto Stock Exchange ' s Oil & Gas Subindex , which rose to 7 , 161 points in late May , has shed six percent to trade at 6 , 708 on Tuesday , down 77 points on the day . Hardest hit recently have been companies that produce large volumes of heavy oil , which is trading at a deepening discount to light crude . The investment community has also shown little tolerance for companies failing to meet production estimates , as shown last week in the price meltdowns of Renaissance Energy Ltd and ELAN Energy Inc after news that output would not live up to analysts ' expectations . But Peter Linder , analyst with CIBC Wood Gundy , said numerous companies still had operating momentum with good drilling and production opportunities over the next 12 - 18 months . " Some of these stocks have an awful lot on their plate and I think this is a really good buying opportunity , despite not recording very good second - quarter numbers , " Linder said . He said Canadian Natural Resources Ltd , Amber Energy Inc and Berkley Petroleum Corp were examples of firms with strong production growth outlooks , which should also beat the industry average for second - quarter results .

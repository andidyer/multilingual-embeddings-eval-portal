Aalsmeer flower mart worried at Schiphol night ban . Aalsmeer flower auction , the world ' s largest auction , is concerned about the effect a night ban on certain wide - body aircraft would have on its flower imports at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport . Schiphol has proposed a night take - off ban on wide - body aircraft from August 1 . An Aalsmeer spokeswoman said it is worried about the impact on imports , especially from Israel , Kenya and Zimbabwe where most of the flowers come from . " It would effect our whole process as the flowers are flown in during the night to be ready early in the morning to go to the auction , " she said . This ban could delay all of our processes , we are not very happy with the situation , she said as there are worries that airlines will go to other airports because they cannot turn - round in the time scale covered by the ban . El Al is one of the carriers most badly effected and it is considering a move to Liege airport in Belgium . El Al cargo manager , Israel Chervin , said its schedules are tied in with the flower industry . Flowers picked during the day time in Israel are flown to Schiphol at midnight ( 2200 GMT ) before the aircraft return to Israel at 0300 AM hours ( 0100 GMT ) , he said . At peak times , six to seven flights a week could be hit by the ban , and these would be full of flowers , he said . Aalsmeer will rely on the airlines to make their objections heard , she added . - Reuters Air Cargo Service Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax + 5017 - www . racs . com

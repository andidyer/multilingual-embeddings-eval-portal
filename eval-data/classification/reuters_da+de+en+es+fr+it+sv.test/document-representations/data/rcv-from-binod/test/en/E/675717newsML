Slovak govt , cbank discuss economic measures - FinMin . The Slovak government and central bank officials are negotiating a series of possible moves - - including monetary policy measures - - to help strengthen the economy , a Finance Ministry official said on Friday . Ministry spokesman Jozef Mach told Reuters Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar , economic ministers of his cabinet , and central bank officials were meeting in Trencianske Teplice , western Slovakia to discuss possible measures to be taken . " The premier , some ministers and central bank officials are discussing further moves in the fiscal and monetary fields , " Mach said . He declined to comment on local press reports that the government was considering replacing the current import deposit plan , which has been criticised by the European Union , with the introduction of an import surcharge to improve the trade balance . " The meeting is not secret , but it ' s also not open enough to allow me to offer any details , " Mach said . Last month the Statistical Bureau said the country ' s trade deficit totalled 27 . 908 billion crowns ( $ 836 million ) for the January - April period , up from 21 . 498 billion for the same period in 1996 . Mach added the cabinet would officially discuss the measures during its next regular session on Tuesday . On Friday , several Slovak newspapers quoted unnamed sources as saying the government was negotiating a package of economic measures , similar to those recently introduced by neighbouring Czech Republic . " The public finance development is bordering the threshold of tolerance . . . and refinancing the state budget deficit , which in ever more expensive and complicated , must also be solved immediately , " the daily Narodna Obroda quoted an unnamed source as saying . Between next August and October state treasury bills totalling more than 25 billion crowns are due to mature . Narodna Obroda said the goverenment was also likely to introduce some cuts in budget expenditures , similar to those made recently by the Czech cabinet , which totalled nearly 46 billion crowns . - - Peter Javurek , Bratislava Newsroom , 421 - 7 - 521 - 8402 ( $ = 33 . 38 Slovak Crowns )

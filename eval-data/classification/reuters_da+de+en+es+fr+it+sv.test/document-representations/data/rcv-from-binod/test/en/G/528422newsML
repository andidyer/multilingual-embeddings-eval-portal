Threats force Va . governer to halt tobacco speech . Virginia Gov . George Allen cancelled a speech to tobacco growers because of threats from callers who objected to his declaration of April as Confederate history month , his spokesman said Tuesday . Allen had been scheduled to speak Monday night at the annual meeting of the Concerned Friends for Tobacco at the Woodlawn Academy , a private school in Chatham . Allen spokesman Ken Stroupe said calls were made to the school and to the tobacco group declaring that " If the governor showed up , the school would cease to exist " . " My understanding is that there were several calls . We did not receive calls in this office , " Stroupe said . He said the decision to cancel the appearance was made jointly by the tobacco group , school officials and the governor ' s office . In a statement , Allen said " It is a shameless act that must be taken seriously . " Stroupe said officials were concerned about " the relative closeness to the anniversary of the bombing in Oklahoma City . " A huge bomb blast destroyed a federal government building in Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 , killing 168 people . The callers said they were upset with Allen because he endorsed a special proclamation last month designating April as Confederate Heritage and History Month . Allen later apologised to people who took offence at the declaration .

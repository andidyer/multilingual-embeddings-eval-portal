Brazil stocks extended losses , plummeting 8 . 17 percent in nervous trade midday , with blue chips leading the nosedive , particularly Telebras losing 8 . 84 percent to 134 reais , brokers said .

Some traders said that unconfirmed rumors that some financial institutions could also be on the sell side in the bolsa to cover previous losses with futures index contracts contributed to the market slump . " Now anything can be a reason for the heavy sale , " one said . The sell - off , they say , apparently was triggered by local stock funds cutting positions in a preemptive move to cover future withdrawals from retail investors . Such investors , they said , were not used to the bolsa and were rattled by its recent strong volatility . Brazilian individual investors had moved into stock funds seeking higher returns than those provided by fixed - income investments . The bolsa , before this week ' s profit - taking frenzy , had made gains of over 80 percent , well above any other investment . Early this week , some of those investors decided to take profits , prompted by concerns , which analysts said proved to be unfounded , that Brazil could also be the target of speculative attacks that forced some Asian nations to devalue . Analysts , however , could not estimate how much cash has exited the funds so far this week . All blue chips showed significant losses . State oil firm Petrobras was 6 . 82 percent lower at 273 . 01 reais . Private miner CVRD was 6 . 63 percent lower at 25 . 20 reais . ( ( - - Fatima Cristina , Sao Paulo newsroom 5511 2485412 ) )

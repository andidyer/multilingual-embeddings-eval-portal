Dow index rebounds from Friday ' s bruising . Stock prices steadied in early trading Monday as bruised market bulls returned to nurse their wounds after Friday ' s biggest market rout since the 1987 crash . At 9 : 50 a . m EDT , the Dow Jones industrial average was up 20 . 21 points at 7 , 715 . 56 , as it got its footing after a 247 - point plunge Friday wiped out 3 . 1 percent from the world ' s most closely - watched stock index . The selloff , which was fanned by concern that corporate earnings may lose some of their luster after two years of strong growth , was the second - worst fall for the blue - chip index after the 508 point meltdown Oct . 19 , 1987 . " On balance we ought to have a decidedly better day than Friday . We may see a bit of bargain hunting mixed with an attempt at stabilization , " said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . Analysts said the market was still susceptible to a relapse after a disappointing earnings report from Hewlett - Packard Co . Hewlett - Packard , the nation ' s second - largest computer company , reported earnings of $ 617 million , or 58 cents a share in its fiscal third quarter vs . year earlier earnings of $ 425 million , or 40 cents . Analysts had expected the company to earn 68 cents a share , according to First Call . Hewlett - Packard ' s stock was off 2 - 15 / 32 at 63 - 1 / 4 . The bond market was also steady , with the yield on the Treasury ' s key 30 - year bond holding unchanged at Friday ' s close of 6 . 55 percent . The stock rout failed to ignite the jitters that usually accompany a steep collapse because investors sensed that the market ' s retreat was not necessarily bad for stocks , analysts said . Wall Street had been bracing for a correction , and the consensus was that stocks were overvalued after the Dow soared 880 points since the start of the summer amid moderate economic growth . Another factor contributing to the market ' s stability was the fact that nothing has dramatically changed in the economic landscape , analysts said . Last week , the government painted an ideal picture of the economy with producer prices in July falling 0 . 1 percent for a record seventh straight month and consumer prices inching up a marginal 0 . 2 percent . The lack of inflation has been a major driving force behind the market ' s spectacular rise over the last 2 - 1 / 2 years . Investors ' attention was also turning to Tuesday ' s meeting of the Federal Reserve ' s policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee . The betting is that the group will favor keeping interest rates unchanged .

Afghan Taleban face new military alliance . The fundamentalist Islamic Taleban militia that has seized control of most of Afghanistan faced a new threat on Friday after its enemies united in a military alliance . In an apparent sign of nervousness at the strongest challenges yet to their conquests , the Taleban militia warned foreign journalists on Thursday of reprisals if they made " baseless " reports of its setbacks on the battlefield . Already encountering the worst reverses in two years of fighting , the Taleban were hit by the alliance signed on Thursday between Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum , ousted government military head Ahmad Shah Masood and Karim Khalilli of the Shia Moslem Hezb - i - Wahadat . The three agreed to fight the militia , born in religious schools in refugee camps in Pakistan , together unless it stopped attacking Masood . " Whoever is not ceasing to fight against one of the signatories , the other signatories will jointly fight against them , " Dostum spokesman Mohammed Yusuf told reporters . Witnesses said they had seen scores of Taleban casualties being ferried away from a Masood counter - attack near the strategic Salang Passs which forced the Taleban to break off their bid to battle into his Panjsher Valley stronghold to the east . Travellers said Masood ' s men had staged two ambushes south of the front line on Thursday , killing several Taleban before melting away . The Taleban have barred reporters from the area . " I would like to comment on news which has been broadcast over the last two days . . . and I would like to point out that you should refrain from broadcasting these kinds of news , " Taleban Information Minister Amir Khan Mutaqi told a news conference . " The news that was broadcast by international media that heavy losses were inflicted on the Taleban and many of the Taleban died was completely baseless and whoever has broadcast these news has committed a moral crime , " Mutaqi said , " Therefore I advise you not to release any news that has not been confirmed by the concerned authorities of the Taleban . " He reminded journalists of the expulsion from the town of Herat last year of a BBC journalist after reports that upset the local Taleban leaders . There was no immediate reaction to the signing of the military counter - alliance from the Taleban , but the combined strengths of the three enemy groups could overwhelm the militia ' s black - turbanned warriors . Dostum has probably the best equipped fighting force in Afghanistan and his Uzbeks , descendants of the Mongols of Genghis Khan , are feared as the toughest fighters in a land of tough fighters . He also has a small air force and at his back are the nations of Central Asia who , along with Russia , have expressed fears publicly of any push by the Taleban and their harsh Islamic Sharia law across their borders . Dostum had already moved armour and men south of the Salang Tunnel , the main choke point on the highway through the mountains that divide north from south . Masood , an ethnic Tajik , managed to keep most of his armour and men together in a hasty flight to the Panjsher valley , though he may have difficulty getting them out again after triggering landslides to seal its entrance , military analysts said . Khallilli , long nervous about the Sunni Moslem Taleban , who are mostly ethnic Pushtuns , controls territory in Bamyan province to the west of Jabol - os - Saraj , held by Taleban but which now appears highly vulnerable to attack from three directions .

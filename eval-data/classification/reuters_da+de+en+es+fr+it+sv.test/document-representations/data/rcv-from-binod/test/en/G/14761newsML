Mother Teresa improves , nuns pray for " miracle " . Mother Teresa ' s condition improved on Monday as she fought against a faltering heart but doctors said the Nobel peace laureate was stll in danger as long as she depended on a respirator . " She is slightly better than last night . There are signs of improvement , " an official at Calcutta ' s Woodlands Nursing Home , where the Albanian - born Roman Catholic nun is being treated , told Reuters . Mother Teresa , known as the Saint of the Gutters for her devotion to the poor and destitute , was admitted to the hospital last Tuesday with a high fever and severe vomiting . The fever has abated and the vomiting stopped but doctors said her heart continued to beat irregularly . She remained on an artificial respirator and was still being drip fed . Doctors said they wanted to wean her off the respirator , which amounted to a life - support system for the missionary , who marks her 86th birthday on Tuesday . Mother Teresa blessed a group of nuns on Sunday evening by gently raising her hand . Sister Judith , a member of the Missionaries of Charity , the order founded by Mother Teresa in 1949 , said on Monday her improvement was " a gift of our prayers " . " Prayers can bring miracles , " the sister told Reuters . Members of the order celebrated Mother Teresa ' s birthday on Monday . They traditionally mark the event a day early . " Mother does not believe in celebrating birthdays but we like to make it an event . We celebrate it a day before , " said Sister Jovita , in charge of Shanti Dan ( Gift of peace ) , Mother Teresa ' s home for mentally ill women . A banner reading " Long live Mother Teresa " and " Happy birthday Mother Teresa " was placed above the entrance to the Woodlands Nursing Home . Father Jeff Bayhi , a U . S . - based friend of Mother Teresa , read out a " birthday poem " from Pope John Paul during a morning service at the Mother House , headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity . Dr S . K . Sen , medical director at Woodlands , said Mother Teresa was still unable to speak . " Mother Teresa had no further cardio - vascular problems during the day , though her heart rate is still irregular , " Sen said on Sunday evening . Doctors said her heartbeat was less irregular and she was breathing easier than before . But Sen said Mother Teresa , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 , was not out of danger . " We are very much encouraged by today ' s ( Sunday ) progress . By tomorrow we hope things will significantly improve , " he said . Roman Catholic churches continued their prayers on Monday for Mother Teresa ' s recovery . Calcutta ' s Archbishop Henry D ' Souza , who prayed by her bedside for most of Sunday , appealed to the people of Calcutta to continue praying for her . Earlier , thousands of people , including Moslems and Hindus , joined in prayers for the nun . Several foreigners , including a group of touring Japanese , visited the Mother House and knelt down to pray for her . " She is a living saint for everybody , " said Sister Priscilla , a senior nun at the order .

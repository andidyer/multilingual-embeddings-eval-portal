BRITISH NURSES SAUDI TRIAL ADJOURNS FOR SENTENCE . Lawyers representing the family of an Australian nurse murdered in Saudi Arabia said on Sunday the Islamic sharia court had rejected new defence evidence for two British nurses and adjourned to consider its verdict . " The court has adjourned and both parties will be notified of the verdict at a later stage , " Usama al - Sulayem , from the International Law Firm told Reuters by telephone from Riyadh . " There will no more hearings , no lawyers no documents , " he said adding that the court will hold a closed session at an unspecified date to issue the verdict . The trial of Deborah Parry and Lucille McLauchlan resumed on Sunday in the eastern Saudi city of Khobar . Witnesses said Parry , 38 , and McLauchlan , 31 , who had arrived at some previous hearings in a police van from prison - - were not in court . Parry and McLauchlan are accused of last December murdering Yvonne Gilford , 55 , at a military medical complex in the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran where they all worked . They say they are innocent and they have withdrawn confessions which they said they were forced to sign . Lawyers for the two women had said on Saturday they would present critical new evidence that could undermine the right of the victim ' s family to demand the death penalty if they were found guilty of killing Gilford . According to Saudi law , the victim ' s immediate family - - her mother Muriel and brother Frank - - has authority to demand the death penalty if the defendants are found guilty and the court rules the death penalty is appropriate . Execution in Saudi Arabia is usually beheading by the sword in a public square . Frank Gilford has repeatedly said he prefers the maximum sentence . Defence lawyers , the Law Firm of Salah al Hejailan , said they have obtained evidence regarding the mental competence of Mrs Muriel Gilford . Lawyers in Australia representing the nurses said Muriel Gilford suffered from Alzheimer ' s disease and was not mentally competent to agree with her son ' s call for execution . Legal experts in Riyadh said that under Saudi law , a call for the death penalty by a victim ' s family must be unanimous . They said that if Muriel Gilford was mentally incapacitated Frank Gilford could not make the decision alone . Australian authorities would have to appoint her a guardian other than her son to make the life - or - death decision , they said . " The defence lawers presented the court with photocopies of a an Australian court ruling and an Australian doctor ' s report , " al - Sulayem said . " They ( defence lawyers ) were told that an Australian court has no jurisidiction over a Saudi court . . . the documents were rejected , " he added . Al - Sulayem said a proof of Mrs Gilford ' s mental incompetence would hamper any possible reconciliation process but would not deprive Frank Gilford of his right under sharia law to demand capital punishment if the two women are found guilty . A statement by the defence lawyers sent to Reuters on Sunday said . . . " it was not clear from what has taken place in the sharia court ( on Sunday ) whether the judges will dismiss the case or uphold the confessions or submit the case to a higher court . "

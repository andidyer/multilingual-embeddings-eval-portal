U . S . consumer income jumps in Feb , spending muted . Americans ' incomes grew at the fastest rate in eight months during February on strong job gains , the Commerce Department said on Monday , but consumers controlled their spending and put more into savings . Total incomes jumped 0 . 9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 6 . 71 trillion - - the biggest gain since a matching 0 . 9 percent rise in June last year and more than double the 0 . 4 percent gain in January . But spending edged up just 0 . 3 percent to $ 5 . 33 trillion following a one percent increase in January , the smallest rise in five months since a 0 . 1 percent increase last September . Consumers apparently used the extra money to bolster savings , rather than to spend , as savings climbed to 5 . 5 cents out of each dollar earned from 5 . 1 cents in January . Department officials said it was the highest savings rate in five months , since 5 . 6 cents of each dollar earned was put into bank accounts or other forms of savings last September . The big jump in incomes evidently flowed from a surge in job creation during February . " Employment , average hourly earnings and average weekly hours all increased in February , " the department noted . There were 339 , 000 new jobs created in February , the government reported at the beginning of March , as a steadily expanding economy bolstered work opportunities and consumer confidence . The Labor Department is scheduled to release employment figures for March on Friday amid expectations another 182 , 000 jobs were generated by a rising economic tide . Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases that fuel two - thirds of national economic activity . Spending on durable goods , which includes cars , was up a slight 0 . 1 percent in February to an annual rate of $ 652 . 4 billion . Spending on nondurable products grew 0 . 3 percent from January to a rate of $ 1 . 60 trillion while spending for services increased 0 . 4 percent to $ 3 . 09 trillion in February . The Federal Reserve decided last week to push up short - term interest rates , citing its concern that strong demand might fire up potential inflationary wage and price rises .

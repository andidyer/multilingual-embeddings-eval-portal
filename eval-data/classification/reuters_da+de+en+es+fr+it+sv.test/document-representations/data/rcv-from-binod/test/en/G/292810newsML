U . S . Sen . Finance head backs Barshefsky at USTR . Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth , R - Delaware , Wednesday announced his " strong support " for U . S . Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and said he will move her nomination through his panel quickly . Roth said in a statement the White House has formally requested a waiver of laws barring appointment to the post of anyone who has represented or advised a foreign government on a trade matter . Both the Senate and House must approve this waiver while the nomination needs approval only of the Senate . Roth stated , " I am pleased to announce my strong support for Charlene Barshefsky to be U . S . Trade Representative . She has distinguished herself in her four years of service as Deputy USTR , and I intend to move her nomination through the Senate Finance Committee as expeditiously as possible . " The committee will take up her nomination the week of Jan . 27 . Earlier , Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , R - Mississippi , said she was a good choice but he had not made a decision on whether to support the legal waiver needed to permit her to take the job .

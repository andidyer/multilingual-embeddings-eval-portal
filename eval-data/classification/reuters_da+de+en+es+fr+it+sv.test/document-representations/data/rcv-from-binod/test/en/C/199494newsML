Russia ' s Kamov shows off new Alligator helicopter . Russia ' s Kamov design bureau showed off on Tuesday its new Ka - 52 military helicopter , to be codenamed Alligator . Kamov president and chief designer Sergei Mikheyev told a news conference the two - seat aircraft was based on the single - seat Ka - 50 combat helicopter , known as Black Shark . " But it is not a copy of the Black Shark because Ka - 52 is equipped with an upgraded radio - electronic system which allows it to observe several air and ground targets and to coordinate others helicopters above the field of combat , " Mikheyev said . Kamov has spent 18 years designing and building the single Ka - 52 prototype which will begin its test flights next month . It will cost $ 12 to 14 million depending on arms and equipment . Mikheyev did not say the helicopter ' s price for domestic customers . He gave no details of the armaments but said the new craft had French - made observation equipment . " Eighty percent of its components came from the Ka - 50 , " he added . The Alligator will be displayed at the Indian air show next month . " We are trying to find potential customers , " Mikheyev said , adding that the Ka - 52 faced strong competition from South African and U . S . - made helicopters of the same class . Kamov has an export licence for its helicopters . Company officials said the Ka - 52 would be produced at Arsenyev in the Russian Far East . On Monday , the plant resumed assembly of Ka - 50s after a two - years halt due to cash problems . In total , 12 Ka - 50s have already been produced there . All of them were supplied to the Russian army . Mikheyev said the Ka - 52 could be used as a training helicopter or as a naval deck helicopter . Kamov is also finishing assembly of the first Ka - 226 two - seater light helicopter . Allied Signal Aerospace of the United States and Pratt and Whitney Canada are involved in the project . Mikheyev said its test flights were expected next year .

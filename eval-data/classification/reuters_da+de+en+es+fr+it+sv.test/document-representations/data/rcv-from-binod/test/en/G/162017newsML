Dole stumps hard , slams Clinton . Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole entered the second full day of his campaign marathon on Saturday with breakfast at a riverside restaurant and a prediction of success from retired Gen . Colin Powell . " It ' s a race . . . that is winnable and he ' s going to win it , " Powell , who was chairman of the military Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a crowd of several hundred at the Lagoon Restaurant along the Delaware River outside Philadelphia . Powell called Dole ' s last push for the presidency , during which he has vowed to campaign non - stop for 96 hours , " the mother of all campaign trips . " Dole said ethical questions surrounding the administration of President Bill Clinton were starting to take hold with the voting public and swinging momentum Dole ' s way . " We are going to win this election , " said Dole , adding that he intended to end his campaign in Independence , Missouri , the hometown of Harry Truman , who came from behind to win the 1948 presidential race . " We ' ve had literally a scandal a week in this administration the past several weeks . I think the American people are starting to say ' what ' s going on there ? What ' s going on in this White House ? ' " he said . At a later stop in Indianapolis , Dole told a crowd of 1 , 500 in an airplane hangar that if Clinton were re - elected his ability to lead would be crippled by investigations into accusations against him . " If he ' s re - elected he ' s going to spend half of his time next year with investigations . . . who knows what will happen in the next 24 months , 36 months , " Dole said . Dole was in the midst of a second full day of a campaign marathon that will continue until he casts his vote in his hometown of Russell , Kansas , on Tuesday . Dole , who plans to hit at least 14 more states by election day , spoke about the disorientation his marathon has begun to spark . " I can ' t remember when we started , but I can remember where we ' ve been , " he said . After breakfast , he was asked how he was faring . He said he was a " little bit " tired . " Not bad , though , " he said . " We ' ll be all right . I ' m starting to get used to it . " Earlier , at a stop in New Jersey , he called out while signing autographs , " I ' m in Philadelphia , right ? " Dole arrived in New Jersey in the pre - dawn hours on Saturday , stopping off at Hasbrouck Heights for a cup of coffee and cheers at an old - fashioned diner . About 300 supporters were waiting for Dole when he arrived at 4 : 44 a . m . EST ( 0944 GMT ) . Accompanied by New Jersey Republican Gov . Christine Todd Whitman , Dole had a cup of coffee and chatted with diner owner Anthony Diakakis , a Democrat , who said he was supporting Dole . Urged by the sign - waving crowd outside to " speak , speak , speak , " Dole said through a hand - held microphone : " If there ' s this much enthusiasm in New Jersey and New York and this area , we ' re gonna win just like the Yankees won . " The crowd , obviously Yankee baseball fans , roared approval at the mention by Dole of the World Series champions , who came from behind to win against the Atlanta Braves . Dole is lagging Clinton in the polls ahead of Tuesday ' s election and , cheered by recent polls showing the gap narrowing , hopes his marathon tactics will inject enthusiasm into his campaign and swing voters to his side . In the Reuters / Zogby daily tracking poll released on Saturday , Dole had closed the gap between him and Clinton to 3 . 8 percentage points - - 42 . 4 percent to 38 . 6 percent , with Reform Party candidate Ross Perot at 8 . 4 percent . Other polls , however , show Clinton with a much larger margin .

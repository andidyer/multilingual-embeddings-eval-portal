GIA warns of more attacks on Algerian celebrities . Algeria ' s Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) has posted warnings in the capital that more Algerian personalities will be killed , residents said on Friday . News of the threat surfaced one day after a retired general was killed and assassinated union leader Abdelhak Benhamouda , a staunch supporter of President Liamine Zeroual , was buried . " The warnings are in tracts pasted on walls in Hussein Dey , " one resident said by telephone . " They are signed by the GIA and apparently were put up just a few days ago . They ( the GIA ) are threatening soon to attack all Algerian personalities , journalists , film - makers and senior executives . " About 60 media employees have been killed since mid - 1993 in attacks blamed by authorities on the rebels . Journalists work under draconian laws on what they can report on security issues and are accused by Islamists of supporting the government . Hussein Dey , a working class suburb in the overcrowded capital Algiers , is a bastion of Moslem fundamentalists . One of Algeria ' s best known figures , UGTA union leader Benhamouda , was shot dead last Tuesday in the city ' s central May 1st Square . No - one has been arrested . The authorities blamed Moslem fundamentalists for gunning him down . His death , just weeks after he had announced he would form a political party , and the escape of the killers in the heavily - policed city , provoked a storm of questions in Algeria ' s independent newspapers as to who had really killed him , or ordered his elimination . Benhamouda was given a martyr ' s funeral on Thursday , attended by the president and senior government figures . Shortly afterwards , Algerian security forces reported that a " terrorist group " - - Algeria ' s official term for Moslem fundamentalists - - had killed retired general Habib Khelil in the western Algerian city of Oran . Security sources told Reuters they believed Khelil was in his 60s . They said he had been responsible for army logistics under late president Houari Boumedienne and ran the army recruitment service under former president Chadli Benjedid . About 60 , 000 people have been killed violently since the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election which Islamists were set to win . A new general election is promised in the first half of this year .

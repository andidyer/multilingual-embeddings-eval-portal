CSX income hit by Conrail costs , Burlington net rises . Freight railroad CSX Corp . said Tuesday its net income edged down 3 percent in the second quarter , hurt by increased costs associated with the acquistion of Conrail Inc . Another freight railroad , Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp . , said its second - quarter net income rose 11 percent . The Richmond , Va . - based railroad said profits totalled $ 227 million , or $ 1 . 04 a share in the second quarter , compared with $ 234 million , or $ 1 . 11 per share , a year ago . The results fell short of analysts ' expectations , who had forecast an average of $ 1 . 07 a share , according to First Call . CSX and rival Norfolk Southern Corp . agreed in April to a joint $ 10 . 3 billion purchase of Conrail after waging a six - month battle for control of the East Coast railroad . The proposed transaction , which is subject to approval by federal regulators , calls for CSX to pay $ 4 . 3 billion for 42 percent of Conrail . CSX said the Conrail acquisition reduced its net earnings by $ 18 million , or 9 cents a share . Excluding the Conrail impact , CSX second - quarter earnings would have totalled a record $ 245 million , the company said . CSX said cost - control efforts helped boost the company ' s operating income to a quarterly record of $ 433 million , up from $ 408 million in last year ' s second quarter . Revenues totalled $ 2 . 7 billion for the period , virtually unchanged from a year ago . In addition to its railroad operations , CSX owns Sea - Land Service , the biggest U . S . container shipping company . CSX rose $ 1 . 56 to $ 57 . 375 a share in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange . Burlington Northern Sante Fe said its net income rose 11 percent for the second quarter , driven by solid growth in its intermodal business : cargo carried in containers hauled by ships , trucks and trains . The nation ' s second biggest freight railroad reported profits of $ 235 million , or $ 1 . 50 a share , for the period , compared with $ 211 million , or $ 1 . 35 a share , a year ago . Burlington , based in Forth Worth , Texas , said revenues totalled $ 2 . 07 billion for the second quarter , up $ 49 million from the second quarter of 1996 . " The company has rebounded well from the weather - related difficulties of the first quarter , " said Burlington Chairman Robert Krebs . " We expect our results to continue to improve throughout the balance of 1997 . " Intermodal revenues climbed 12 percent during the quarter , to $ 563 million , the company said . Burlington said agricultural commodity revenues declined by 10 percent to $ 239 milion , reflecting a poor Southern Plains wheat crop and fewer corn shipments . Coal revenues were also lower , declining 2 percent to $ 482 million . Burlington Northern Sante Fe ' s rail network covers some 35 , 000 miles in the western United States and Canada . The company ' s stock rose $ 1 . 94 to $ 93 . 50 in consolidated NYSE trading at midday .

PLANS TO FLOAT FORMULA ONE BUSINESS STALLED - REPORT . Plans for a mid - year float of shares in the Formula One Grand Prix motor racing business on the London and New York stock exchanges are likely to be stalled , Britain ' s Independent newspaper said on Thursday . The newspaper said Formula One ' s multi - millionaire owner Bernie Ecclestone had postponed flotation plans and had instructed his advisers to examine the alternative of a private sale . There were also doubts about the 2 . 5 billion stg ( $ 4 . 1 billion ) price tag put on Formula One ' s business when news of a planned flotation appeared two months ago , the Independent said . " The sale , if it happens , is expected to put a significantly lower value on Formula One , " it added . Ecclestone , one of Britain ' s richest men , is expected to retain his controlling stake in Formula One if a private sale takes place . The entrepreneur , president of the Formula One Constructors ' Association and owner of the sport ' s promotion arm , has transformed motor racing into a spectacular event attracting a 450 million global television audience for each of the 16 Grand Prix events . The Independent said flotation plans had encountered problems over timing and fierce resistance from some constructors . These constructors were thought to be insisting they should emerge with the bulk of the share after the float , the newspaper said . A large number of interested parties , ranging from media companies to wealthy individuals , have expressed an interest in buying a stake in Formula One . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4366 ( $ = 0 . 614 British Pounds )

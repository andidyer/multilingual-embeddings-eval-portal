Tung calls meeting of HK legislature - in - waiting . Hong Kong leader - designate Tung Chee - hwa has called the first meeting of the territory ' s interim legislature next week , members of the chamber said on Thursday . Local media speculated the lunch meeting would discuss operating procedures of the controversial body , installed by China after disagreements with Britain over the future of the existing , elected Legislative Council . When the colony reverts to China next July 1 , Tung will become the territory ' s chief executive and Beijing will replace the current legislature with the interim chamber picked by a China - controlled Selection Committee last week . The interim body , to be known as Provisional Legislative Council , will sit until a new legislature can be elected . Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind have denounced China ' s plan to scrap the territory ' s present legislature . The United States has also called the planned move " unjustifed and unnecessary " . Local democrats have condemned it as illegal and undemocratic , while some fear the provisional and current chambers will clash before the transfer of sovereignty . Members of the interim legislature told Reuters Tung was calling a meeting with them on Monday . " We were invited , " said Elsie Tu , one of the members . " I know he is calling a meeting . " Tu said she had no idea about the meeting ' s purpose . Eric Li , another member of the provisional chamber , said he had not received any notice about the meeting but was told by colleagues it was for exchanging views . Stanley Shen , an executive in Tung ' s office , said it was more of a social function than a formal meeting . But the local media speculated it would decide details of how the provisional legislature would operate , such as whether its meetings will be open . The body ' s major tasks include passing legislation , approving the budget , endorsing the appointment of senior judges and debating the first policy address of the chief executive . The Selection Committee , which picked Tung as the post - colonial leader this month , has been swept up in controversy . Some politicians in Hong Kong have criticised China for plans to allow the committee to choose local deputies for the National People ' s Congress , China ' s parliament . They have claimed the plans can compromise the post - 1997 government ' s autonomy because the committee was chosen by a caucus led by mainland Chinese officials . They have also alleged that the plans breach Hong Kong ' s post - handover constitution which stipulates local deputies should be selected by Chinese nationals from the territory .

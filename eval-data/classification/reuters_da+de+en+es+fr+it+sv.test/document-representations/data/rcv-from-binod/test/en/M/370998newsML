Asian crude prices slump , easing import burden . Crude oil prices in Asia have slumped to their lowest level in almost six months , bringing some respite to beleaguered importers , analysts and traders said on Monday . Benchmark Brent crude futures for March were quoted on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) at $ 21 . 08 / $ 21 . 16 per barrel , the lowest since August . New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March traded in Asia at $ 22 . 46 , also the lowest level since August . Both futures contracts have lost more than $ 2 . 00 per barrel in the last three trading sessions . A mixture of factors , including a seasonal slump in demand for key oil products like gas oil ( diesel ) and kerosene , plus selling based on technical chart signals , prompted the sharp slide in prices . The latest prices are still higher than a year ago . The most - active Brent contract was below $ 18 . 00 in early February 1996 . But for many Asian importers , the slump in prices should offer some respite from six months of high prices in the second half of 1996 , when the cost of buying crude hit a six - year high . Last year , China put off buying crude and relied on stocks because of the ramp - up in prices . However , at the end of the year it was forced back into the market and still ended up paying prices that were at six - year highs . India ' s oil cross - subsidy deficit ballooned in 1996 and could reach 184 billion rupees ( $ 5 . 1 billion ) by March if prices hold around $ 22 . 00 per barrel , the Economic Times newspaper reported last week . The subsidy operates to counterbalance the difference between low domestic prices and international prices . Al Troner , managing director of Asia Pacific Energy Consulting , said the fall in prices might offer some respite but at the same time the recent high prices might speed up the process of liberalisation in Asia , and especially in India . " For some countries it will sustain the underlying pressure for liberalisation and energy sector reform , " he said . Analysts said the price spike last year was not long enough or high enough to cause serious economic problems for many Asian countries , including India . But it has highlighted the reliance on government subsidy schemes and their cost . The Indian government of Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda is locked in debate over whether to raise domestic prices to offset the cross - subsidy losses . Analysts say the government has no choice , but the government is worried about a political backlash . Last July , after just one month in office , the government raised oil product prices sharply and then cut the rises back after a public outcry . " Maybe the latest price rise was a warning for the future , " Troner said . There will be sharp price rises in the future but they would not have such an effect if oil prices in India were freed from controls . But analysts have also pointed to other major problems facing Asia , possibly in just a few years , that have little relation to price . They say that unless hundreds of billions of dollars is spent on infrastructure work , Asia physically will be unable to import energy fast enough to service its demand . - - Singapore Newsroom ( + 65 870 3081 )

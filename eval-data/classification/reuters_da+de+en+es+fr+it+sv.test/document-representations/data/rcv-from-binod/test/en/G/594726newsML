Australia honours its bravest donkey . A donkey named Murphy was on Monday posthumously decorated for bravery , 82 years after the four - legged hero carried wounded Australian soldiers to safety in the World War One battle at Gallipoli . In a ceremony conducted by Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer , an army donkey mascot called Simpson accepted the Purple Cross Award for Murphy . Stretcher - bearer John Kirkpatrick and his donkeys , the most famous being Murphy , became war heroes for carrying wounded soldiers to safety under Turkish fire at Gallipoli in 1915 . Fischer praised Kirkpatrick and his donkeys ' heroism as one of the great feats of World War One . " It ' s part of the rich tapestry of our military past and it ' s extremely important that we maintain that military heritage , " said Fischer , who placed the decoration over the donkey ' s neck at a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial . The Purple Cross is a Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) award for animal bravery towards humans . The Gallipoli donkeys were revered by the Australian and New Zealand soldiers for their tenacity and seeming ability to avoid gunfire . About 8 , 000 Australians were killed and 20 , 000 wounded during an eight - month battle that ended in a Turkish victory . The donkeys were trained to walk into a medical tent with the wounded , and upon the command of " back pedal " , reverse straight back out and set off on their next mercy mission . At the insistence of soldiers , Murphy was evacuated during the troop withdrawal from Gallipoli . Kirkpatrick was killed by a Turkish sniper in the battle . Kirkpatrick was posthumously awarded for his bravery .

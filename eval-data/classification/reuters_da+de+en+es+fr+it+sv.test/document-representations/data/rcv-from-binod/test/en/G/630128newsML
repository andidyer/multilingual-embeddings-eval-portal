OAU ' s Salim was ambassador at 22 . Salim Ahmed Salim , who was re - elected to a third four - year term as secretary - general of the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) , was an ambassador at the age of 22 . The Tanzanian politician and diplomat , who has twice failed to take the top job at the United Nations , took charge of the OAU in 1989 and has presided over a period of post - Cold War opportunity for the pan - African organisation . South Africa ' s President Nelson Mandela last December backed Salim as an African candidate for U . N . secretary - general , in part because of the OAU ' s strong stand against apartheid . But South Africa stepped back when France threatened to veto Salim on the grounds that he did not speak French . With U . S . support , Kofi Annan of Ghana secured the top job in New York . Born on the Indian Ocean island of Zanzibar on January 23 , 1942 , Salim was one of the youngsters who rose to prominence to fill the government posts available after Zanzibar merged with mainland Tanganyika in 1964 to form the Tanzanian union . He went to Egypt as Tanzania ' s ambassador in 1964 aged 22 , even before he went to university , and was ambassador to India from 1965 to 1968 while an undergraduate at Delhi University . In his latest re - election at an OAU summit in Harare , Salim was the only candidate after the withdrawal of Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy , who said he did want to divide Africa on the issue . He got the backing of 37 of the 47 members who voted . " Who would deny the fact that Salim ' s diplomatic offensive at forums all over the world during the last eight years has helped to bring the causes of Africa to the forefront of international politics , " said a senior OAU official . African diplomats credit Salim with setting up the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in 1993 , providing a framework for resolving political disputes . The OAU and United Nations appointed Algerian diplomat Mohamed Sahnoun as their first joint envoy in January when he took responsibility for Zaire and the Great Lakes . In practice , however , he reported more frequently to Annan than to Salim . His critics charge Salim with political bias and a failure to delegate responsibility and say he spends too much time globe - trotting and too little at OAU headquarters in Ethiopia . Salim rose through the then - socialist Tanzanian system under former president Julius Nyerere . Heserved as ambassador to China and for 10 years from 1970 as his country ' s ambassador to the United Nations . Sixteen years ago he was a candidate for the U . N . top job but Washington vetoed him because of Tanzania ' s socialism . Salim was Tanzania ' s foreign minister from 1980 to 1984 , prime minister in 1985 , and was deputy prime minister and minister of defence when he took the OAU position in 1989 . He married his wife Amna in 1964 and they have two sons and a daughter .

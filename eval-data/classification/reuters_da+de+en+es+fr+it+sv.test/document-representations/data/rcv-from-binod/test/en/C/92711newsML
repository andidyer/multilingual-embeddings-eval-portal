FEATURE - Norway makes second attempt to build car . Forty years after trying to build a successful car , Norway is having a second go . Troll was the name of an ill - fated vehicle built by a Norwegian joint venture in 1956 , only to go bankrupt with just six cars produced - - the doors on the prototype wouldn ' t open in cold weather . City Bee , an electric car for use in cities , is Norway ' s new attempt to enter the auto industry and the chances are that things will work out this time . Having sold 10 times as many cars as Troll , City Bee is already a success by local standards . " Sixty cars are driven on a daily basis now , half of them in the United States , " said Rolf Gulbrandsen , chief executive officer at Pivco AS car manufacturer in Oslo . " By the end of November there will be 100 City Bees on the streets . " The Norwegian postal authority has bought two City Bees and is using them for mail delivery on a trial basis . " We believe the cars are well suited for mail delivery , so we have decided to buy another 10 this year , " said Petter Skjelstad , head of the information department at Norway Post . With a three - year test period coming to an end , full - scale production of 15 , 000 neighbourhood two - seaters is planned to start next year in Scandinavia and the United States . " We have advanced our plans of full - scale production from 1998 to 1997 because of the great demand from all over the world , " said Gulbrandsen . Founded in 1991 , Pivco has just 30 employees and no relations with the old Troll joint venture . The City Bee , voted Scandinavian Electric Car of the Year 1995 , arguably gets more attention than most cars on the street . It is almost silent , emits no exhaust , and weighs only 750 kg ( 1 , 653 lb ) , including a 250 kg ( 551 . 2 lb ) battery . The body is moulded thermoplastic , which can be easily recycled . Batteries are also entirely recycled , the valuable cadmium of the NiCad batteries being 99 . 9 percent reused . " Operating costs are 0 . 50 crowns ( $ 0 . 770 ) per 10 kilometres ( six miles ) , the car hardly needs maintenance , no oil or grease is needed and the engine lasts five times as long as regular engines , " said Gulbrandsen . City Bee prototypes were unveiled at the Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer in February 1994 and tested in very cold weather . According to the manufacturer , the car performed flawlessly on Norway ' s winter roads . It was a different story 40 years ago . Troll had a Norwegian - made plastic body and was assembled mainly from imported parts - - just like the City Bee . But a demonstration of the new car before parliament ' s Industrial Committee on a cold winter day outside the Royal Palace turned into a comedy . The manufacturer had not foreseen that the freezing temperatures affected the plastic body and aluminium parts in different ways . The doors got stuck and the presenter was unable to open them no matter how hard he tried . It was the beginning of the end for Troll . The manufacturer , based in the southern town of Lunde , sold only five of the six cars initially produced and went out of business after a few months . Several years later , the sixth car showed up as a prize in a lottery .

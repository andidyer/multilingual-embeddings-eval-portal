Private savings keep pressure off rates - Costello . Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday that measures he announced earlier in his 1997 / 98 ( June 30 ) budget to increase private savings would help keep pressure off interest rates . " The only way we can break our foreign debt problem is by having more domestic savers , " Costello said . " The government is going to become a saver . We want individuals to become savers . That will keep pressure off interest rates and will mean that we can grow the Australian economy faster , " he said in an interview on the Seven television network . " Our lack of savings has always been the speed limit on how fast we can grow . We can break the speed limit . We can break the growth limits and that will create the kind of growth and jobs that we want to see in Australia , " Costello said . Earlier Costello released his budget for 1997 / 98 year , which forecast a A $ 3 . 85 billion underlying deficit for 1997 / 98 and a A $ 1 . 6 billion surplus for 1998 / 99 . He also said earlier that the government would achieve lower interest rates by getting the budget into surplus . - - Canberra bureau 61 - 6 273 - 2730

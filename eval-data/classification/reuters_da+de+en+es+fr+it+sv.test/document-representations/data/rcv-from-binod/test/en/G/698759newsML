In new move , Cuba daily reports Catholic mass . Cuba ' s ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma broke new ground on Tuesday , reporting on an open - air Roman Catholic mass - - the first in the communist - ruled island in more than three decades . Granma printed a six - paragraph report by the national news agency AIN on the mass , held in the square in front of Havana Cathedral on Sunday . The move apparently reflected official efforts to open up more space for the Roman Catholic Church ahead of Pope John Paul ' s visit to Cuba next January . Granma , published daily from Tuesday to Saturday , has not previously reported details of a Catholic church service on the island , Cubans say . Several thousand people attended Sunday ' s mass , which was led by Cardinal Jaime Ortega and was held to mark the feast of Peter and Paul , founders of the church in Rome . Church officials said last week that permission for the open - air mass was an encouraging sign of more official flexibility . Granma said " one of the reasons " for the mass being held outside was because the cathedral is being renovated for the pope ' s visit . The service also looked like a first dress rehearsal for several open - air masses the pope is expected to lead in Havana , Santiago de Cuba , Camaguey and Santa Clara during his Jan . 21 - 25 visit . State television showed extracts from the mass in a news programme on Monday , again breaking with a tradition of not reporting religious services . Church officials said last week they had asked the government for one of the papal masses to be broadcast live on television during the visit . The church has also asked for permission for Ortega and other Cuban bishops to appear on television before the trip to explain its significance . After President Fidel Castro ' s 1959 revolution , church schools were nationalised in the early 1960s and many foreign priests were sent home . Christmas stopped being a public holiday . Religious practice remains limited to church premises .

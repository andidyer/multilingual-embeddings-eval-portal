TENNIS - " LUCKY " SAMPRAS SURVIVES TEENAGE CHALLENGE . A little - known Slovakian teenager gave world number one Pete Sampras the fright of his life at the Australian Open on Monday , taking him to five sets in a fourth - round cliffhanger . Dominik Hrbaty , a 19 - year - old ranked 76 in the world , ignored searing heat to produce some of the most exciting tennis of the tournament before Sampras reasserted himself to win 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 4 in two hours and 53 minutes . " There ' s an old saying , it ' s better to be lucky than good and I definitely had a lot more luck than good today , " Sampras told reporters after the match . Sampras ' s near - defeat followed a day of surprises on Sunday when temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 Fahrenheit ) on court saw three top women seeds , including world number one Steffi Graf , bundled out of the tournament . The women ' s upsets continued on Monday , with unseeded Belgian Dominique van Roost ousting 15th seed Chanda Rubin of the United States in straight sets , 7 - 5 6 - 4 . But number 14 seed Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States managed to dispose of unseeded Swiss Patty Schnyder 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 1 . Third seed Goran Ivanisevic also faced a heart - thumping five - setter on Monday to advance to the quarter - finals , fighting back from two sets to one down to beat unseeded Norwegian Christian Ruud 4 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 3 . Temperatures on Monday were even higher than at the weekend . " It was unbelievable I ' ve never played in such conditions before , " Ivanisevic said . " I was out of it , I didn ' t know where I was . " Ivanisevic now meets either 11th seed Jim Courier or fifth seed Thomas Muster , while Sampras will face the winner of Monday ' s fourth - round match between 10th seed Albert Costa and eighth seed Wayne Ferreira . In the women ' s draw , there was more heartbreak for Slovakia . Ninth seed Karina Habsudova lost the chance of a quarter - final berth against Martina Hingis when she was beaten 6 - 4 6 - 4 by Romanian eighth seed Irina Spirlea . After storming to victory on Saturday night , Sampras told reporters he would not even recognise Hrbaty if he bumped into him in the locker room - - although Hrbaty said he had asked Sampras for his autograph at the French Open three years ago . After Monday ' s match , in which the teenager pushed Sampras around the court with long forehands and used a deep and powerful serve to whip up 20 aces , the Florida - based number one is unlikely ever to forget him . " I think he believed he could beat me . I was very impressed , " said Sampras . " I think he ' s going to be a player to be reckoned with in coming years . " The Slovakian is the youngest man in the top 100 and jumped 287 places in 1996 in the fastest rise of any player . He turned professional last year and has so far earned US $ 71 , 000 compared to more than $ 25 million earned by Sampras . Down 2 - 4 in the deciding set , Sampras looked to be in a daze , sapped of energy and heading for an upset loss rivalling his third - round exit at last year ' s Australian Open . His tactic of conserving energy , waiting for the grand slam debutant to make mistakes , seemed at best risky as the teenager set pulses racing , earning a break point and a chance to serve for the match at 5 - 2 . Sampras saved the break point and , having closed out the game with an ace , his strategy finally began to pay off . Hrbaty double - faulted in the next game to allow Sampras to even the score at 4 - 4 and then squandered another break point in the ninth game to lose his momentum entirely . Sampras then shattered the Slovakian ' s dream of a grand slam quarter final berth , breaking him in world number one style with a forehand winner down the line . " I hope next time we meet , we play each other , I beat him , " said the undaunted Hrbaty . " I will try to play better than today . " World number four Ivanisevic hammered 38 aces as he came back against 56th - ranked Ruud . The volatile Croat once again displayed his fiery temper , throwing his racquet to the ground as the Norwegian built up a two sets to one lead . But where the top women failed on Sunday , the top men scraped through . Ivanisevic knelt down to celebrate his victory but leapt straight back up again . " I was almost burnt , that was a mistake , " he said .

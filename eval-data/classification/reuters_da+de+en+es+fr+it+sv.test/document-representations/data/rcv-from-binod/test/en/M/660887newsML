INSIGHT - Gilts need to close over 114 - 08 to rally . LIFFE September gilt futures must close above 114 - 08 if they are to tackle the contract high , technical analysts said on Friday . Steve Hutt , technical analyst at NatWest Financial Futures in London , said the daily chart looked negative at the beginning of the week but the market bottomed and has posted positive action for the last couple of days . " Looking at candlestick charts we had a hammer formation on Tuesday and the market has rebounded strongly from there , " he said . " The key level to get through on a closing basis is 114 - 08 , to extend this move up that has been in place since May 22 . " Gilts made a daily high on Thursday at 114 - 08 , matching the high of June 6 . At 0717 GMT , September gilt futures were at 114 - 05 , up 1 / 32 on the day . Hutt said if gilts made a concerted break up through 114 - 08 they were set up for an assault on the September contract high at 114 - 31 , formed on May 9 . " From an hourly point of view the market is also looking positive but its approaching overbought , " he said . " There should perhaps be a bit of caution although it looks as if a probe to the upside is most likely at the moment . " If gilts failed to hold up , Hutt said they would establish themselves in a medium term range with 113 - 04 as critical support . " If that goes it will set up a double top formation which will give a downside target of 112 - 00 , " he said . Richard Adcock , manager of technical research at HSBC Futures saw gilts pushing higher , prompted by a break of 114 - 00 and then the test of 114 - 08 on Thursday . " The constructive background curently in place indicates this level can be breached , " he said in a research note adding that he set a target at 114 - 26 , from a rising trendline . " To the downside stops are placed under 113 - 19 , " Adcock said . At the short end September short sterling was unchanged at 93 . 14 .

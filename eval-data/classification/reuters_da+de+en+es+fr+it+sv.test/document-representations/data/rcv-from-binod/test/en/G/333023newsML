Arson blamed as Hong Kong karaoke bar blaze kills 15 . Fifteen people burned to death in a blaze that swept through a karaoke night club in a Hong Kong nightlife district on Saturday , and officials blamed arson for the territory ' s second fire tragedy in as many months . Most of the casualties were young people . Thirteen victims were being treated in hospital and two were on the critical list , hospital sources said . The fatalities included five men and 10 women . Hospital sources said it was not known if any non - Hong Kong nationals were among them as not all the bodies had yet been identified . Up to 100 people were said to have been in the club when the fire struck but most escaped . Hong Kong fire chief Peter Cheung said the unusually rapid spread and voluminous clouds of smoke were suspicious . " In this particular case , the fire spread so rapidly from the staircase to the second floor that it could mean there was some fuel to help the fire , " Cheung said at a news conference . Ordinary furniture would not produce so much smoke , he said . Secretary For Security Peter Lai declined to give firm reasons for the causes of death , noting there may be an inquest . " Regarding the causes of death , since there may be a coroner ' s inquest I don ' t think I can give you a very certain answer , " Lai told the news conference . The blaze raced through the Top One karaoke bar in the Tsimshatsui district of Hong Kong ' s Kowloon Peninsula shortly before daybreak and took firefighters over one hour to quell . There were about 100 people in the building at the time . James To of the Democratic Party , chairman of the Legislative Council ' s security panel , expressed grave concerns about safety at karaoke clubs . " I would urge the government to consider licensing of karaoke or mandatory imposition of safety standards on karaoke , " he said . At present karaoke bars only face strict safety requirements if they apply for liquor licences . Not all do . Police cordoned off the street around the gutted karaoke bar and sent in arson detectives to scour the wreckage for clues . The neon - lit district is packed with cramped entertainment facilities such as karaoke bars , a popular haunt for revellers who drink and sing along with pop music videos . Governor Chris Patten rushed to the scene , offered his sympathies to the victims and their families and paid visits to the survivors in hospital . Patten vowed every effort would be made to find the cause of the fire , calling it " another dreadful incident . " The blaze broke out on the first floor of the bar in Pratt Avenue around 4 a . m . Firemen managed to extinguish it in less than 90 minutes . Survivors fled the building down firemen ' s ladders as the blaze raced from the first floor to the second and third . It was the second major fire tragedy in Hong Kong in as many months . In late November forty people were killed in Hong Kong ' s worst building blaze on record when fire gutted a commercial block in Kowloon ' s " golden mile " Nathan Road shopping district . That blaze triggered a public outcry demanding more stringent fire safety standards for Hong Kong ' s residential and office buildings . This month legislators endorsed a motion urging a review of buildings management , noting that the November fire was partly a result of neglecting fire safety .

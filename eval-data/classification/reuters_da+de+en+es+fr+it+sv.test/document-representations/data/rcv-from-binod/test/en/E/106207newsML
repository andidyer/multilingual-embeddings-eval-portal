State finances healthiest since 1980 , study says . The National Conference of State Legislatures ' annnual survey of state budgets concludes that state finances are at their healthiest level in 16 years . The survey , published in the October - November issue of the group ' s magazine , measured general fund ending balances , including reserves , as a percentage of general fund spending . " At the end of FY 1996 , the aggregate balance was 5 . 8 percent , with no state ending the fiscal year with a deficit , " the report said . " This is the healthiest state finances have been since FY 1980 , when the aggregate state balance reached a whopping 9 percent . " Five states did not report their results and were not included in the survey . They were New York , Massachusettes , Rhode Island , Hawaii and Virginia . While the aggregates paint a broad picture , most states were still " flush with cash " when examined individually , the study said . Most had general fund balances in excess of five percent , while nine had balances in excess of 10 percent , the study said . Among the states with enviable balances were Alaska , with 97 . 7 percent because of its enormous reserve fund , Indiana with 18 . 8 percent , Michigan with 13 . 2 percent , Nevada with 16 . 8 percent and Ohio with 13 . 3 percent , the study said . The study attributed the trend to the nation ' s generally healthy economy , and to reduced spending for social services and welfare programs . The study said most states have been riding the crest of a strong economy for a couple of years , which has allowed them to squirrel away excess revenues into their rainy day funds . " Well - endowed rainy day funds accounted for more than half of the aggregate state ending balance in FY 1996 , " the study said .

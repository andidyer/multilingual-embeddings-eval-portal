SCIENCE - SMARTCARS ( BUSINESS FEATURE , GRAPHIC ) . By Neil Winton , Science and Technology CorrespondentMakers of the tiny Smart car say it is a revolution in the making which will change urban motoring for ever . But detractors see a venture offering a vehicle which is too small , too expensive , and too ugly . For Lars Brorsen , chief executive officer of Micro Compact Car AG which will make Smart , it is the car of the future . The diminutive two - seater will help solve the problem of urban traffic in a stylish , safe and environmentally friendly way , according to Brorsen . Analysts are not so sure . They believe sales projections are wildly optimistic . Smart is to be produced by a 1 . 5 billion mark ( $ 868 . 1 million ) venture between German luxury car maker Mercedes and SMH of Switzerland . SMH , the acronym for Suisse Microelectronique et dHorlogerie is better known for making Swatch watches . Analysts also doubt the concept behind the car . Small cars shortly appearing from mass car makers like Germany ' s Volkswagen AG and Italy ' s Fiat SpA will not only undercut the 16 , 000 mark base price for Smart , but offer four seats . BIG MANUFACTURERS TAKE AIM AT MINICAR SECTORPeter Schmidt , analyst at Automotive Industry Data , said most big car companies believe minicars will indeed be a most successful new sector , but the public will not go for something as radical as the Smart . " All the mainstream manufacturers are trying to produce small , affordable cars for the masses . I think VW will be able to offer a little car for less than 15 , 000 marks that seats four , " Schmidt said . " No doubt Mercedes , like everybody else , has identified that this sector will have significant growth . But you have to have the right product . No doubt time will tell , but it is not only incredibly ugly , it only has two seats , " he said . The 600 cc Smart enters production later this year at a factory in Saareguemines , France , and should appear in Europe by next March or April . Because of the space limitations of the 2 . 5 by 1 . 45 metre ( eight feet by five feet ) design - - Smart says three cars sideways will take up the area of a normal parking bay - styling is practical rather than romantic . The rear of the car drops straight down from just behind the front seats . SMART IS RISKY PROJECT " However you look at it , there has to be a huge questionmark over its success . I don ' t know of any other manufacturer which plans to enter that section of the market with a two seater , " Schmidt said . VW is unveiling its little Lupo at the Frankfurt car show in September , and plans a stripped down version next year called the Lupino . Schmidt believes even the Lupo will be cheaper than the Smart . Smart production capacity of 200 , 000 is unlikely to be met any time soon . Schmidt believes 100 , 000 will be tough to reach . Smart has been relentlessly cutting back its sales projections , with Brorsen now expecting 100 , 000 in 1998 . Smart had predicted 160 , 000 in 1998 , rising to 200 , 000 by 2000 . Nigel Griffiths , European motor analyst at McGraw - Hill ' s DRI believes sales will only reach between 70 , 000 and 80 , 000 in 1998 , with a long term maximum of not more than 130 , 000 . Even a small car specialist like Fiat couldn ' t sell many more than 150 , 000 Cinquecentos a year , Griffiths said . Griffiths said new models from Fiat in this sector next year , and later from a possible General Motors Suzuki Motor partnership would provide tough competition . Japanese companies like Toyota and Nissan with experience in the 1 . 5 million a year local minicar market will also be free to attack this sector after European trading barriers disappear by 2000 . SMART SAYS CAR IS VALUE FOR MONEY , SAFE , EXCITINGSmart ' s Brorsen is undaunted . " Our aim is for a car which is value for money . We believe that we are value for money at 16 , 000 marks , " Brorsen said . In a presentation in Brussels last week Brorsen played a video showing how the Smart had been designed to give unprecedented safety , even in an accident with inevitably bigger vehicles . The company is eager to dismiss any notion that small cars are more dangerous . " We don ' t say this car is the answer for everything you do in life , it is specifically for urban transportation , " said Brorsen . " It is the emotional issue which is the key to the whole thing . It is an intelligent solution . It speaks to you in emotions and lifestyle . " FUTURE CAR RESTRICTIONS WILL SPUR MINI VEHICLESAnalysts say that part of the game plan behind the Smart is the anticipation of more curbs being placed on cars , like higher taxes and tolls to ration use , and physical restraints in towns . Minicars and clean cars are likely to escape many controls . " We don ' t want the government to sell our cars , but if changes are not made whole cities will come to a standstill . We have to find another solution , the space is not there . In some Japanese towns you are not allowed to buy cars without a parking space . Some of these measures way be necessary in Europe . " Brorsen said that in 1999 , Smart will make a convertible and a diesel , and a diesel / electric hybrid by end 1999 . Some 95 dealers have been signed up in Europe , just short of the goal of 103 . Smart is trying innovative marketing techniques , and using modular construction , fast becoming the buzzword of modern automotive construction . As part of its packages , Smart also plans to offer big car rentals which might occasionally be needed . Cheap car hire from railway stations and airports is also a possibility . AID ' s Schmidt said he couldn ' t exclude the possibility that Smart might succeed as a fashion icon . " 16 , 000 marks for an ugly two seater is still a lot of money , but it could become a cult car , like the Citroen 2cv , but that had four seats , " Schmidt said . DRI ' s Griffiths also said Smart could take off . " We could have egg on our faces , but so could they , but they ' ve put up all the money , " Griffiths said . ( 1 . 728 German Marks )

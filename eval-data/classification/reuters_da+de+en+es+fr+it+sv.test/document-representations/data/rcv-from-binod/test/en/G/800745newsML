Belgian child sex trial set for shooting gallery . The murder trial of convicted Belgian child rapist Marc Dutroux will take place at a disused army shooting gallery in the south of the country , a spokeswoman for Belgium ' s Minister of Public Works said on Thursday . Dutroux , arrested a year ago , is charged with the murders of eight - year - olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , and accomplice Bernard Weinstein . He is being held in an isolation cell in the city of Arlon . A ministry spokeswoman said it was unclear how long refurbishment would take on the building in an abandoned army training centre at Callemeyn , near Arlon and the border with Luxembourg . Belgium ' s trial of the century is unlikely to begin until late next year . The country has been in shock since the discoveries of the dead children , and there have been widespread accusations that Dutroux and his accomplices had friends in high places . At the time of the killings , Dutroux was on parole from a 13 - year sentence for multiple child rape . Last October more than 250 , 000 people took to the streets of Brussels , as much to vent their disgust at a system seen as deeply corrupt as to show support for the victims and their families . Julie and Melissa starved to death early last year , some nine months after being abducted from close to their homes near the eastern city of Liege . Dutroux was arrested for the abduction of two other young girls and soon led police to the Julie and Melissa ' s bodies , buried next to Weinstein on a property he owns . The girls he had abducted , Sabine Dardenne and Laetitia Delhez , were rescued by police from a makeshift dungeon in one of Dutroux ' s houses in Charleroi and found to have been sexually abused . Barely two weeks later , Dutroux led police to the buried bodies of An and Eefje , who had disappeared a year earlier on a visit to the coast . An all - party parliamentary committee is investigating the cover - up theories . It is due to report at the end of September . A preliminary report in April - - following six months of televised hearings that attracted huge audiences - - revealed a trail of bungling , inefficiency , unprofessional behaviour and missed chances that ordinary Belgians found unbelievable . Child abuse activists plan a commemoration march on Sunday August 17 through Sars - La - Buissiere , where the bodies of Julie , Melissa and Weinstein were buried , although the local mayor has signalled his strong disapproval .

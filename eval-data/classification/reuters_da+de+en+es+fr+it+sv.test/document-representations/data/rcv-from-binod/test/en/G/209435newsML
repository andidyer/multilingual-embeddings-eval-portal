Hostages freed , seized in Central African Republic . French - backed government loyalists and mutinous soldiers in Central African Republic exchanged hostages overnight , including the son of former military leader Andre Kolingba , witnesses said on Friday . A later report , however , said the mutineers had taken hostage Enock Dernt Lakoue , head of the opposition Social Democratic Party and a man tipped by some as a potential successor to Prime Minister Jean - Paul Ngoupande . The government , in a statement on Friday , said simply that the loyalists had freed rebel - held hostages with French support in the " spirit of non - violence " promoted by Ngoupande . Witnesses said Major Guy Kolingba was among three handed over by government loyalists overnight . Mutineers said he had been arrested on Monday after responding to a broadcast call to return to his unit . Two loyalists were handed over , witnesses said . A member of Lakoue ' s family said mutineers seized him on Friday as he was visiting the widow of former self - proclaimed emperor Jean - Bedel Bokassa in an area they hold . Bangui ' s archbishop , Monsegnor Joachim Ndayen , is trying to mediate in the crisis - - the third army revolt this year . The capital was calm but tense with loyalists and French troops guarding strategic points in the city . French troops intervened in May under a defence accord to maintain elected president Ange - Felix Patasse in power during a bloody revolt over pay and conditions . Dissident soldiers mutinied again over pay in April . Patasse is visiting Europe but former colonial power France reinforced its Bangui base from Chad . The French contingent in Bangui now numbers 1 , 500 men . French officials believe the mutineers want to overthrow the government and are in touch with opposition politicians . Ngoupande , appointed by Patasse as part of measures to defuse the May mutiny , says the latest revolt is political . " This uprising , contrary to previous mutinies , was clearly politically motivated right from the start , " he told heads of diplomatic missions in Bangui at a briefing on Thursday . He said some mutineers wore civilian clothes . Opposition parties have condemned the uprising but also denounced what they call Patasse ' s tribalist policies . The army is divided between soldiers from Patasse ' s northern region and militants from the south , suspected of allegiance to former president Kolingba , one of several candidates defeated by Patasse in the first multiparty elections in 1993 . The mutineers on Saturday revived demands for back pay from 1992 and 1993 and for Patasse to revoke a decree ordering one of the regiments involved in revolts to a base out of the capital . They also seek implementation of recommendations made by a national conference after the May revolt , including forming a professional army with a greater role in national life . They vowed to respond violently if French troops try to dislodge them . " The Central African forces . . . will set the country ablaze starting with the port oil terminal which they occupy , " a spokesman , Sergeant Christian Gueret , said on Friday .

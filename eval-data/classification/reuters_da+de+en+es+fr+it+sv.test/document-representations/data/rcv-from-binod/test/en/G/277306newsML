FEATURE - Gentleman Marxist is Italian government ' s lifeline . Most of Europe ' s Marxists have been consigned to the dustbin of history , but one communist leader to buck the trend is Italy ' s Fausto Bertinotti . As communist parties across the continent disbanded , Bertinotti and his followers formed a new Marxist force in Italy , one of the world ' s richest societies , that can count on about 10 percent of the popular vote . Thanks to a general election result last April that gave neither of the two main political blocs outright victory , his Communist Refoundation party holds the balance of power . Though the party is not in the cabinet , without its 35 votes in the lower house of parliament Prime Minister Romano Prodi ' s centre - left " Olive Tree " coalition government cannot survive . Bertinotti , a 56 - year - old former trades union official , has proved an astute player of Italy ' s complex political game , lending Prodi his support in return for concessions on economic policy without fully committing himself to the partnership . " We are neither in the government nor outside it , " Bertinotti said in an interview . " It is a condition destined to last if , as we hope , the Prodi government has a future . " This month Bertinotti overcame opposition from a vocal minority at a party congress to continuing the formula and calls from forces in the government to forge a more stable link than the external support Communist Refoundation provides . KEEPING PRODI GUESSINGBertinotti claims success this year in ensuring that health spending and Italy ' s generous pensions system remained unscathed in a tough budget Prodi has drawn up for 1997 . His defence of " workers ' interests " has struck a chord beyond his bedrock electorate . Many voters feel deeply unsettled by talk of deep cuts in social spending which many economists say are needed for Italy to put its house in order and join Europe ' s planned single currency . Next year , Bertinotti wants Prodi to turn his attention to reducing unemployment and tax evasion and has hinted that he will make both issues a test of his continuing support . " If a government of the centre - left is incapable of pursuing policies different from those of the right then it ' s clear that it will die , " he said . " That is not holding the government to ransom . That is stating the facts . " Communist Refoundation was formed in 1991 when a reformist majority disbanded the old Italian Communist Party , once the biggest in the West , to switch to social democracy and give birth to the Democratic Party of the Left ( PDS ) . Bertinotti stayed in the PDS for two more years , hoping to pursue a platform of internal opposition , before leaving . The PDS is now the biggest party in Prodi ' s government . Despite talk by PDS leader Massimo D ' Alema of forging a new broad left alliance , Bertinotti sees no room for reconciliation with a force he says has turned its back on blue collar Italians and is in direct competition with his own party . " These two lefts are very different not only because of their political line . . . but also because of their social points of reference , " he says . A MARXIST WITH DRESS SENSEAt first glance Bertinotti is not your classic communist . Fashion magazine editors this year voted him the country ' s best dressed politician . His accent is easily mistaken for that of an Italian aristocrat and his regular reading includes L ' Osservatore Romano , the Vatican ' s daily newspaper . But delve into what makes him tick and you will find a committed Marxist troubled less by the collapse of Soviet - style communism than by what he sees as the rampant advance of monetarism and the free market . " If , as an adult , you haven ' t understood that the capitalist system is unliveable then you haven ' t understood very much about life , " he said , adding that " creative interpretation " is what is needed to make Marx relevant to the 21st century . Bertinotti , born in World War Two Milan , was raised in a tenement building as the son of a socialist railway worker . His adult life has been spent almost entirely in the trades union movement , where his first taste of industrial action came representing textile workers in northern Italy in the 1960s . For 10 years he was regional leader of the CGIL union in Turin , where he fought some bitter disputes with car giant FIAT , before entering the national leadership , which he left in 1993 after accusing it of selling out members ' interests . His party draws strong support from industrial workers as well as students . " I am one of those who think that politics begins with social conditions and working conditions , " he said . " There is no way of being on the left unless you think that way . " THE " COURTEOUS TERMINATOR " Bertinotti makes no bones about reading L ' Osservatore Romano , citing the strong influence of Roman Catholicism in Italian political history and , while without religious belief , his " great respect " for the social commitment of the Church . His accent , marked by an aristocratic - style inability to roll his Rs , is distinctive of the area he hails from and his dress - - smart jackets , a tie and slacks - - a mark of the influence and tastes of his wife Gabriella . " I ' ve dressed this way for years and , rightly , nobody noticed until recently , " he said , bemoaning what he calls a trend to " spectacularise politics " . Bertinotti ' s elegant image is finished off by a rare ability among Italian politicians to keep his cool . His polite approach to debate , invariably heated in Italy , has earned him two affectionate nicknames in parliament - - " Comrade B . " and " The Courteous Terminator " . " If you trust in your arguments there ' s no need to shout at your adversary and be aggressive , " said Bertinotti . " You also have to try to understand if your opponent , even if he is being aggressive , has something useful to suggest that you can poach . "

British Borneo bubble set to burst - analysts . British - Borneo Petroleum Syndicate Plc has become the main victim of takeover fever gripping the oil sector , but analysts say a bid looks increasingly unlikely and warn the shares may well drop sharply . " It is hard to tell when the bubble will burst , but it almost certainly will , " said a leading analyst who declined to be named . Another analyst a major broker agreed , saying British Borneo looked too expensive to attract any takeover interest . The oil minnow , which has promising interests in the Gulf of Mexico , jumped 96 pence to a 12 - month record of 948 - 1 / 2 . British Borneo already powered 50 pence ahead on Tuesday when it announced its latest Gulf of Mexico deal , exploiting British Petroleum ' s Nirvana field and retain the rights to 40 percent of the profits . Like all of British Borneo projects in the region this one too is the exploration stage where no oil has actually been pumped up in commercial quantities . To illustrate the view that British Borneo shares are running ahead of themselves , one analyst said the the latest deal with BP was only worth an estimated 50 million stg if everything went absolutely to plan . In sharp contrast , British Borneo ' s market capitalisation had increased by about 85 million stg . " The market seems to be willing to value anything British Borneo does at a completely unrisked basis , " the analyst said . British Borneo , already one of investors ' favourites last year , is gaining increasing momentum due to an ongoing string of takeovers taking place in the exploration and production sector . The latest deal to date is the 432 million stg hostile bid for Clyde Petroleum Plc launched by Gulf Canada Resources on December 18 . " Of course any E & P company would be touted as a takeover target after the bid for Clyde , but British Borneo would not be one of our top candidates for somebody to launch a bid for , " said another industry watcher . " You are paying for your belief in the management of Borneo , but if you take over the company you lose the management " , he added . " What you are left with is access to technology for deep sea drilling and some acreage in the Gulf of Mexico : it seems like a pretty top price to pay .

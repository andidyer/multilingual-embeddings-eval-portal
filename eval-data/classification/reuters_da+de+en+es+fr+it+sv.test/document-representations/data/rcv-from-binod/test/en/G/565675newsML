S . African truth probe may call Winnie Mandela . South Africa ' s " truth commission " probe into apartheid - era crimes said on Wednesday it would probably call President Nelson Mandela ' s ex - wife Winnie to testify about two missing children . A member of the commission , Yasmin Sooka , told reporters it was " more than likely " that the commission would subpoena Mandela ' s divorced wife , now known as Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , to give evidence in camera . A decision would be taken " possibly in the next two weeks or so " on whether to call Winnie , a parliamentarian and head of the ruling party ' s womens league . Sooka said the possibility of summoning Madikizela - Mandela arose after the parents of two children who went missing in the black township of Soweto in the 1980s asked the commission to try to find out what happened to them . At the time Winnie lived in Soweto surrounded by the " Mandela United Football Club " , a group of young bodyguards who Soweto residents accused of waging a reign of terror . The leader of the club was jailed for murdering one boy , Stompie Seipei , in 1989 . Madikizela - Mandela herself was convicted of having kidnapped the boy and received a fine . " Direct evidence has come before the commission , " Sooka said . " Parents have asked about the disappearance of their sons . . . ( who ) were taken by the football club . " President Mandela divorced his wife last year , accusing her of being a spendthrift who showed him no affection . He set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1995 to uncover as much as possible of crimes committed by all sides during 30 years of armed struggle against apartheid . It has powers to grant amnesty to those who cooperate with it .

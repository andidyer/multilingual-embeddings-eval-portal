Dollar up vs mark , British pound surges after Labour budget . The dollar surged to another 40 - month peak against the German mark on Wednesday , but fell sharply against the pound after Britain ' s new Labour government released its first budget . Sterling initially stumbled when British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown began his budget speech by saying that he shared British industry ' s concern about the strength of the pound . But as the details of the budget emerged the pound began a sharp climb , rising almost 3 cents against the dollar and as much as five pfennigs at its peak against the mark . Dealers said the budget did not appear to have gone far enough in curbing strong consumer - led growth in Britain , leaving the door open for a near - term hike in interest rates that would benefit the pound . " Brown ' s initial remarks took sterling down to the lows but the rest of his comments were well received and we saw heavy buying of sterling , " said Cynthia Johnson , managing director of foreign exchange at CIBC Wood Gundy . " I think people perceived the budget as leaving the door open for higher interest rates . " The pound surged to a high of $ 1 . 6785 before settling at $ 1 . 6755 , well above late Tuesday ' s rate of $ 1 . 6588 . It also surged to a new five - year peak above 2 . 94 marks , helping the dollar post ample gains against the mark as well . The dollar closed at 1 . 7540 marks against 1 . 7471 late on Tuesday , after hitting a third consecutive 40 - month peak against the German currency of 1 . 7550 . Also helping the dollar against the mark was a report showing that German industrial production had fallen by a surprising 0 . 2 percent in May . The dollar ended weaker against the Japanese yen , which rose during Asian trading hours after the Bank of Thailand announced it was dropping its pegged exchange rate system and letting its currency float freely . Initially , news of the Thai baht ' s flotation sent it sharply lower and sparked active buying of yen , which often acts as a safe - haven currency in times of turbulence in other Asian markets . But as the day wore on and the markets digested the news , the yen ' s strength faded somewhat . The dollar ended at 114 . 47 yen , down from 114 . 93 on Tuesday . The British budget announcement and the news out of Thailand overshadowed the Federal Reserve ' s decision to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two - day policy meeting on Wednesday . The dollar fell slightly after the rate decision , which was widely anticipated in the market , but its losses proved fleeting . In other trade Wednesday , the dollar rose to 1 . 4700 Swiss francs from 1 . 4665 Tuesday . The dollar slipped to Canadian $ 1 . 3765 from C $ 1 . 3797 .

" The market ' s correction was expected because of last week ' s rally , " said Jonas Ferrer , research director of Pryce Securities . Traders said they expected sluggish trading on Tuesday as the ongoing initial public offering of shopping mall owner Ever - Gotesco Resources and Holdings Inc was drawing attention away from the stock market . Others , however , said bargain - hunters would see any dip in the bourse as a buying opportunity since second quarter gross national product figures are expected to be released next week . " A GNP figure approximating the first quarter ' s 6 . 2 percent will buoy the market , " said Pryce ' s Ferrer . - LILIAN KARUNUNGAN 63 2 841 - 8937 Fax 8176267

Sunderland on target for stadium move . English premier league soccer club Sunderland Plc said it expected its new 42 , 000 seater stadium to be available for the start of next season . Sunderland Plc , publishing maiden interim results following flotation , said it expected construction of the new ground to be completed in June , leaving time to fit it out before the season starts in August . The club has exchanged contracts on the sale of Roker Park , its home for almost a century , for a total of 1 . 3 million pounds net of demolition costs . Completion will take place in the club ' s next financial year . Sunderland , floated in December , had pre - tax profit of 1 . 1 million pounds in the six months to November 30 against a loss of 1 . 6 million pounds in the comparable 1995 period . Turnover more than doubled to 5 . 2 million pounds following the club ' s promotion to the premier league . The improvement came from higher ticket sales and increased sponsorship and television revenue . Sunderland are 14th in the 20 - team premier league , with 12 matches remaining . The bottom three are relegated . " Although there are some tough fixtures still remaining , we are well placed to fulfil our objective of retaining premier league membership , " chairman Bob Murray said . - - Keith Weir , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8793

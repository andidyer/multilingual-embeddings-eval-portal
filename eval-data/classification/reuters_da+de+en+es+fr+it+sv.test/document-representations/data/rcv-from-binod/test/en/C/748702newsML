Owens Corning eyes Africa growth . Owens Corning , currently on a big expansion drive to build up its sales abroad , said Wednesday that prospects for growth in Africa were " excellent . " Chairman and Chief Executive Glen Hiner said he was bullish over investment in the continent despite the depreciation of several emerging market currencies against the dollar . " If there was a dramatic ( currency ) change , that might have a short - term slowdown . But we come to Africa with a longer range view and that ' s really what we ' re looking at , " Hiner told Reuters . " We believe the prospects for growth are excellent in Africa . We are encouraged by the stabilisation we see being achieved , and we are encouraged by the new environment for business that we see developing . " Hiner was in the Zimbabwean capital to attend an African / African American summit of political and business leaders . Hiner said his company was in negotiations with the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Trust to build a $ 10 million factory for large - diameter piping in Zimbabwe , near the city of Bulawayo . A formal agreement is due before the end of the year and plant construction will take 10 - 12 months . Owens Corning started its first African business in 1993 with a factory in Botswana and moved into South Africa last year by taking a majority stake in the former Acoustical Fibreglass Products operation , since renamed Owens Corning SA . It now employs about 800 people in Africa . In Botswana , Owens Corning is supplying 250 km of piping for the country ' s $ 330 million North - South carrier pipeline . It has also secured orders for Africa - produced products from Zimbabwe , Namibia , Botswana , South Africa , Swaziland and Zambia worth a total of $ 110 million . Hiner said the company was interested in further strengthening its base in drought - prone sub - Saharan Africa , focusing on the water , sewer and irrigation projects . " Thus far we ' re satisfied with the results we ' ve generated and what we ' ve been able to do , " he said . " Our total revenues for next year ( calendar ) 1998 ) will be about $ 80 million in all of our operations in Africa and we are looking at a double - digit compound growth rate going forward - - over five years , that ' s the horizon we have . " Owens Corning , based in Toledo , Ohio , had 1996 sales of $ 3 . 8 billion and employs 19 , 000 staff in over 30 countries . Hiner said Owens Corning felt it was too dependent on its home market and was seeking general expansion opportunities . " We want a larger percentage of our sales to come from outside the United States , " he added . " We want to achieve a better balance of business around the world . " During the first half of this year , sales outside the United States accounted for 25 percent of its total , but Hiner said the company had set a target of 35 percent .

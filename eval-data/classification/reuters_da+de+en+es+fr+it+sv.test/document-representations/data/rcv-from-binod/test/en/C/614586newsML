Boral to spend A $ 21 mln on brick project .

The project would include brick forming , drying , kiln , handling and packaging equipment .

Midland Brick had conducted a worldwide study of the latest technology and productivity advances and adapted these to meet Midland ' s raw material and products . " The new fast firing kiln will be among the most energy efficient in the world and will allow Midland to continue to meet changing market demands with a lower cost base , " Boral building products managing director Marvin Weinman said in a statement . Midland Brick already had obtained environmental approval for the new kiln which included a commitment to lower overall emissions from its brick making operations . Final discussions were proceeding with several specialised Brick Plant design and construction companies and contracts would be finalised over the next few weeks .

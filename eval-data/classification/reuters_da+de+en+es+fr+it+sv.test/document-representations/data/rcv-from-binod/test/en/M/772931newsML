Mortgage security prices decline ; spreads tighten . Mortgage - backed security prices declined in tandem with U . S . Treasury prices , but mortgage security spreads to government securities tigtened . The sell - off in Treasuries was fueled by the July employment report , which showed that the jobless rate fell to 4 . 8 percent from June ' s 5 . 0 percent and National Association of Purchasing Management ' s index of industrial activity rose to 58 . 6 percent , its highest level since November 1994 . Participants said that spreads on mortgage - backed securities outperformed Treasuries by as much as three to four basis points depending on the coupon . A New York pass - through trader said there was a blizzard of activity early Friday ahead of the jobs data ; after the report market players reported seeing a West Coast money manager buying 7 . 0 percent Federal National Mortgage Association coupons and 7 . 5 percent FNMA coupons . The upward movement in Treasury rates - - the 30 - year bond yield rose to 6 . 46 percent - - may have allayed fears of prepayments in 8 . 0 percent coupons . " There was some up - in - coupon activity and some people were buying 8 . 0 percent coupons , " said a New York MBS salesman . In recent sessions , MBS investors have been preoccupied with the possibility that home owners will refinance their mortgages . Market players said some investors moved out of Treasuries into mortgage - backed securities Friday . Some of the decline in Treasuries , said a New York MBS salesman , may have been exacerbated by speculative players who stayed in the market long enough to see the 10 - year Treasury note yield linger around 6 . 0 percent . Initially , speculative profit - takers sold off and then they were followed by investors , said a market participant . One New York trader reported seeing some mortgage - banker sales late in the session and the salesman said that mortgage bankers were seen buying put options on mortgage securities . Next week mortgage - backed securities should be relatively quiet as fixed - income investors focus on the Treasury ' s refunding . " This was a healthy selloff to prepare for the refunding . The MBS market probably will be very quiet until the refunding is done , " said William Gooch , vice president of fixed - income research at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc . Late in the session , Government National Mortgage Association 7 . 5 percent coupons were off 36 / 32 at 100 26 / 32 to offer a bond equivalent yield of 7 . 417 . FNMA 7 . 5 percent coupons were off 32 / 32 at 100 25 / 32 and Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp 7 . 5 percent coupons were down 32 / 32 at 100 31 / 32 . Meanwhile , the Treasury ' s 10 - year note was down 41 / 32 at 103 6 / 32 to yield 6 . 18 . ( ( - - Aleksandrs Rozens , U . S . Mortgage Unit , 212 - 859 - 1668 ) )

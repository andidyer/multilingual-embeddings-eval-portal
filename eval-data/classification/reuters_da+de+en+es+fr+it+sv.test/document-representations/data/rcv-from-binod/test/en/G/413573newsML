Turkish envoy visits Iran amid diplomatic row . A Turkish envoy has arrived in Tehran with a message from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani amid a diplomatic row between the neighbours , an Iranian official said on Sunday . A foreign ministry official told Reuters Ali Tuygan , Turkish foreign ministry undersecretary , arrived on Saturday and would meet Iranian officials on his visit but did not elaborate . Iran said on Saturday it had ordered Turkey ' s ambassador in Tehran and another Turkish diplomat to leave , two days after Turkey expelled an Iranian consul . The ambassador and Turkey ' s consul - general in Orumiyeh were given one week to leave Iran because of " activities incompatible with diplomatic norms " , said a Foreign Ministry statement . Turkey on Thursday declared Iran ' s Erzurum chief consul Saeede Zare ' persona non grata ' after he accused a senior Turkish military commander of " irresponsibility " for apparently describing Iran as a " terrorist " state . " Iran considers statements by some Turkish officials against Iran as unacceptable and incompatible with friendly ties between the two countries , " the Iranian statement said . It was referring to remarks by the deputy chief of the Turkish armed forces , Cevik Bir , who criticised Iran for allegedly backing Turkey ' s Kurdish rebels . Tehran protested to Turkey over the remarks last Monday . The English - language Iran News in an editorial on Sunday called on Tehran to exercise self - restraint in response to the tensions with Turkey . " Self restraint is the most befitting response from Tehran to what is going on in Ankara which serves neither the interests of Iran nor Turkey , " it said . The Tehran Times said strained ties between Tehran and Ankara served Israeli interests . " There are certain elements in Turkey who are determined to undermine Iran - Turkey cordial relations in order to appease the Zionist regime and the U . S . officials , " it said . Diplomatic relations between the 18 - year - old Islamic republic and its secularist neighbour have experienced many periods of strain , but the expulsions cap the first major row since an Islamist - led government came to power in Ankara last June . The Iranian statement indicated that Tehran did not want the expulsions to harm relations beyond repair , but that strengthening bilateral ties required efforts by both sides . The row started when Ankara protested to Tehran early in February about Iranian ambassador Mohammad Reza Bagheri ' s comments in favour of Islamic law at an Islamist rally in the Ankara district of Sincan .

India Eicher says car project not final . India ' s Eicher Motors Ltd said on Monday that its car venture with Volkswagen AG ' s Skoda Mlada Bolslav unit had not been finalised . " We have not arrived on a decision , " Subodh Bhargava , Eicher group chairman , told reporters . He said a decision as to whether the project would " go through or will be shelved will depend on , among other factors , a study of the local market " . Eicher Motors has been negotiating with Skoda to manufacture the Felicia model in India . " We are all set for the venture , but want an assurance from our partner that we will , at all times , have only 26 percent equity , " Bhargava said . He said Eicher was not interested in more , and will not settle for less than that , as it did not see itself as a financier for five or six percent . Bhargava added that Skoda wanted Eicher to pick up 49 percent equity in the project . He added that if and when the Felicia was made , it would cost the same as Maruti Udyog Ltd ' s ( MUL ) Zen model and have all the features of MUL ' s Esteem model . MUL , a joint venture between the government of India and Japan ' s Suzuki Motor Corp , is India ' s largest carmaker . The Esteem model is its top - of - the - line 1 . 3 litre four - door sedan , while the Zen is a one - litre four - door hatchback . - - New Delhi newsroom + 91 - 11 301 2024

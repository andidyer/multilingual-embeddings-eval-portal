Handful of firms seen ruling global fund business . The growing cost of running a fund management business will lead to the domination of the industry by a handful of global players , Fidelity Investments managing director Richard Horlick said . Horlick told a conference the traditionally low capital intensive nature of the industry was changing , and escalating research , compliance , delivery and technology costs would lead to fewer firms succeeding . Horlick heads Fidelity ' s European institutional business . He said the major winners would be firms that positioned themselves as global players that could make vast investment and operate in multiple locations around the world , not only with local investors and local regulators but also with the global consultants . The rising cost of compliance , while positive given recent scandals , would raise barriers to entry in the industry . " If the regulatory burden grows and compliance in multiple markets around the world grows it will mean fewer and fewer firms will afford to be in the business . " Technology costs were also beginning to impact on profitability . " Fund management firms in the UK and elsewhere whose position has been growth businesses with very high returns are beginning to see their profits being eaten into by the IT overheads they are now incurring . " But he said niche players in local markets and hedge funds were likely to remain successful . Horlick said retirement funding was one of the industry ' s biggest issues . It was clear a vast majority of countries could not afford full state retirement provision and this will have to be funded privately in one form or another . The traditional defined contribution system was breaking down in most areas of the world as companies moved away from assuming liability by placing the burden on the individual . The replacement of traditional savings systems was also leading to a growing role for fund management . In the U . S . , the proportion of savings held by banks was shrinking dramatically and in Europe equity savings were opening up and this trend would continue . Individual investment trends were changing , with domestic bond and equity allocations shifting to international markets . As a result there would be a move from the traditional firms managing domestic bonds and equities and real estate in their local countries to those providing international expertise , Horlick said . " In many cases these are going to be global firms and not major domestic players . " The fashionable trend was for large banks and other organisations to build businesses in fund management through acquisition , but those acquisitions are usually only the first step in welding together the business . " They may be able to make short term returns on the capital they have invested . . . but the key is creating a common corporate culture and common approach to investment across the globe from different businesses in different countries with different cultures . " Global consultants were also playing a growing role in shaping future of fund management industry , and it was clear they would have big role in assessing which firms were going to secure a significant proportion assets coming available . - - Andrew Gill , London newsroom + 171 542 5887

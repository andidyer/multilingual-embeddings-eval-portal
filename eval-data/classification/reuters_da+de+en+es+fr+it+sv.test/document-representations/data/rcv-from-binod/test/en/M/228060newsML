Some Russian shares active but many being held . A handful of Russian share issues reacted to company specific news in afternoon trading on Monday , but dealers said the market as a whole was quietening down and they preferred to hold rather than sell at the slow end of year . The Russian Trading System index closed up about one percent at 189 . 73 on $ 10 . 5 million market turnover , a relatively low volume which has become average over the last week . Surgutneftegaz preferred shares firmed to $ 0 . 3050 from $ 0 . 2935 after the oil company announced plans to issue an American Depositary Receipt specifically for the prefs . Regional utility Murmanskelektrosvyaz jumped over 40 percent to $ 15 . 00 on 10 , 000 shares trading for the day , fairly typical of price activity in illiquid shares ' discovered ' by investors . But utility Mosenergo , the bellwether of the share market , did not register a single trade on the Russian Trading System . " Over the next month and a half we will have dramatic stock - specific moves but no marketwide moves , barring major events , " said Troika - Dialog ' s Terry Olin . Some traders predicted the market would stay in a five percent range on either side of current prices until year ' s end as many investors sat on shares , indicating a lengthening investment horizon , waiting for new funds to move the market . Peter Kizenko of ING Barings said many second - tier buyers with six - month or longer holding horizons would likely avoid new buying rather than take profits , which was often the case in past activity slowdowns . " A lot of buyers are stepping away because they overheated it , " he said , adding that some were still ready to buy , anticipating much sharper price appreciation in the new year . Olin said regional telecoms were showing some profit - taking , though , which he linked to news that Russia was no longer using London - based investment bank N . M . Rothschild as adviser on sale of a stake in telecoms holding company AO Svyazinvest . " The market is afraid that since a handful of powerful Russian banks will manage the Svyazinvest offering , there may be no injection of capital into the firm and its regional telecoms , " he said . - - Peter Henderson , Moscow Newsroom , + 7095 941 8520

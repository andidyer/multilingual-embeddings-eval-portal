Jordan bourse eyes foreign funds , Iraq in 1997 . Jordan ' s stock market should reverse a poor 1996 performance this year with healthy company earnings from new exports to Iraq and anticipated more global fund buying , the market ' s director said on Sunday . Wahib al - Shair , the director general of the Amman Financial Market , told reporters he was hopeful a " depressing " 40 percent drop in annual turnover to 248 million dinars ( $ 350 million ) in 1996 could be reversed this year . The market turnover has continued to fall since a 1993 peak of 969 million dinars . Shair said political uncertainty was a major factor behind depressed 1996 activity , citing " suspicions over Israel ' s behaviour and peace intentions that have made investors hestitant and afraid and ( introduced ) a wait - and - see ( mood ) " . The official Amman Financial Market 60 - share index stood at 153 . 46 at the end of 1996 , down from 159 . 17 a year before . Investors say price falls averaged 12 percent last year , with market confidence over regional stability further eroded since last May when Israelis elected a new right - wing government with a tougher policy on peace with Arabs . Initial fears Jordan could lose out in the lucrative Iraqi market also dampened sentiment . But recent orders exceeding $ 100 million secured by Jordanian firms under Baghdad ' s $ 2 billion oil - for - food deal with the United Nations have raised hopes Iraqi - related trading would help boost the bourse in 1997 . Shair said high interest rates , blamed by investors for diverting funds to higher yield investment channels and worsening the bourse ' s liquidity crunch , were another negative factor weighing on the market . Shair said expectations of raised foreign investor buying in 1997 were based on global emerging market purchases in December on blue - chips that alone amounted to nearly half of 1996 ' s total foreign buying of eight million dinars . " Half of the net investment that came throughout the year only came in December . If this is a base for 1997 we should expect a lot of investment from abroad , " Shair added . Shair said non - Jordanian investors accounted for deals involving 18 percent of total 1996 turnover and owned 33 percent of the bourse ' s market capitalisation of 3 . 5 billion dinars . But they are mostly Arabs and global funds account for just 1 . 5 percent of the total market capitalisation . Shair also said parliament would begin this month debating a new securities law that would radically reform the market to help it compete regionally . The law , part of Jordan ' s wider IMF - backed reforms , would set up a government watchdog Securities Exchange Commission to oversee a restructured market run by the private sector . Investors say the law will help raise the market ' s profile to foreign investors who have shied from investing on a large scale despite eased ownership ceiling .

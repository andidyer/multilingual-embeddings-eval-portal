RUGBY UNION - Manager denies Lomu wants out of tour . AUCKLAND , Oct 25 - The Jonah Lomu camp on Friday described as " rubbish " reports that rugby ' s biggest name is threatening to pull out of the New Zealand Barbarians ' tour of England next month , NZPA reports . The New Zealand Rugby Football Union will hear an appeal tonight against a one - week ban imposed on the giant Counties Manukau winger for an alleged dangerous tackle on Canterbury fullback Kieran Flynn last weekend . If the sentence stands , Lomu will miss the national provincial championship first division final against Auckland at Eden Park on Sunday . The Dominion newspaper reported today that Lomu was contemplating withdrawing from the Barbarians party , which will be coached by All Black coach John Hart . The two - match tour will include a clash against England at Twickenham . The newspaper said Lomu was angry at the ban and quoted his manager , Phil Kingsley - Jones , as saying yesterday : " Why should he go on a money - making exercise for the NZRFU when it was using its procedures to trip him up ? " But Kingsley - Jones said today that the player had never threatened to pull out . " That ' s rubbish , " he told NZPA . " All we were afraid of was that he might be suspended for six weeks and he might not be able to go . " There ' s never been any doubt about his availability . He can ' t wait to play for John Hart . " While he said Lomu was philosophical about the controversy surrounding the tackle , Kingsley - Jones rounded on the Auckland Rugby Football Union for its full - page advertisement in today ' s New Zealand Herald . The same union that promoted a match as a shield challenge before Auckland had won the Ranfurly Shield has featured Counties ' other explosive winger , Joeli Vidiri , and Auckland first five - eighth Carlos Spencer in publicity for the final . Above the players ' pictures are the tags " four semifinal tries ( Vidiri ) ' ' and " five semifinal tries ( Spencer ) " followed by the punchline : " Lomwho ? " Meanwhile , Counties coach Mac McCallion admitted that he was none too optimistic about Lomu ' s chances of being cleared for the showdown with Auckland . " I don ' t think it looks good , but we have our fingers crossed , " he said . McCallion said there had been big support for Lomu from not just Counties ' fans , but also nationwide , with Cantabrians prominent . " It would be a great shame for the many rugby supporters around the country and for the thousands of kids if Jonah didn ' t play , " he said . " I just hope the appeal committee will take into account Jonah ' s impeccable record to date . " McCallion said Lomu was initially reluctant to go ahead with appeal , but was persuaded to do so . He said the backing from the public , as well as Flynn ' s own statement that there was no malice in the tackle , had convinced the union to mount an appeal . Neither Kingsley - Jones nor McCallion will travel with Lomu to Wellington .

PDVSA in deal talks with several U . S . refiners . Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) is in talks with several U . S . companies to buy stakes in their refineries and negotiations with Phillips Petroleum Co are closest to fruition , a senior PDVSA official said Tuesday . " We have currently conversations with Murphy , Clark , Phillips , Coastal , Conoco to get into new refining capacity to be able to accommodate the production we expect to have by the year 2005 , " said PDVSA executive vice president Luis Urdaneta . " We ' re talking to everybody , " he said . The Venezuelan state oil company , which is looking to double its crude oil production capacity to six million barrels per day ( bpd ) by 2006 , has been linked to a number of U . S . refiners recently . To ensure an outlet for its growing production , PDVSA aims to have a total of three million bpd of refining capacity within the next nine years , including 1 . 6 million bpd outside Venezuela , Urdaneta said at a conference sponsored by consultants Petroleum Finance Co and Enerfinance . He later told reporters that no new refinery agreements were imminent , but talks with Phillips for a stake in its 200 , 000 bpd Sweeny , Texas , refinery were the most advanced . " There is nothing real close to a deal today , " he said . " It would take at least two or three months to do something . " Talks with DuPont Co unit Conoco , he said , involved a " dual deal " to buy a stake in its 225 , 000 bpd Lake Charles , Louisiana , refinery as a follow - on to the company ' s $ 2 . 2 billion Petrozuata joint venture to produce extra - heavy crude in Venezuela ' s Orinoco belt . Similarly , PDVSA has been in talks with Coastal Corp about a possible equity stake in its 100 , 000 bpd Corpus Christi , Texas plant , linked to a $ 1 . 7 billion Orinoco project . PdVSA is also talking to Sun Co Inc about its 85 , 000 bpd Yabucoa , Puerto Rico refinery , Urdaneta said . Though not mentioned by Urdaneta , PDVSA sources have previously said they are studying with Amerada Hess a possible equity stake or some other deal involving its giant 545 , 000 bpd plant in St . Croix , U . S . Virgin Islands . Urdanata said the company expects to close next month a previously announced $ 250 million deal to buy out from Unocal the remaining 50 percent stake in the UNO - VEN joint venture , including a 153 , 000 bpd refinery in Lemont , Illinois , and other downstream assets in the MidWest and eastern U . S . In the wake of losing out to Valero Energy Corp last month in a move to buy two of the three refineries owned by Salomon Inc ' s Basis Petroleum , Urdaneta said PDVSA was simply moving on with other negotiations . Valero paid $ 485 million for all three of the plants . " We won ' t pay more than they ' re worth , " he said of PDVSA ' s losing bid for the three Basis Petroleum refineries . PDVSA already is among the largest refiners in the U . S . , with full ownership through its CITGO subsidiary of four plants with total refining capacity of just over 560 , 000 bpd . Its purchase of the UNO - VEN stake and an increased stake in its joint venture with Lyondell Lyondell Petrochemical Corp ' s 265 , 000 bpd Houston , Texas , plant will bring that up to nearly a million bpd .

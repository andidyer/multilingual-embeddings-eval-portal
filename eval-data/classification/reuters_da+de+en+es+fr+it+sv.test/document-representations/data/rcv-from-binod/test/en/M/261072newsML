Mexico stocks jump as Fed stands pat on U . S . rates . Mexican stocks Tuesday posted one of their best days of the month , buoyed by the return of foreign investors encouraged by the U . S . Federal Reserve ' s decision to keep U . S . interest rates steady . The IPC index of blue - chip stocks closed 78 . 88 points or 2 . 48 percent higher to 3 , 252 . 97 points . " A reaction like this was expected if the Fed didn ' t announce a change in rates , " one market analyst said . " Even though trade was abrupt it was backed by good volume ( of 121 . 11 million shares ) . " The push past 3 , 250 points could spark an IPC rally between now and the end of the year , the analyst said , although profit - taking could put some drag on stock prices . Jaime Fernandez , an analyst with the Interacciones brokerage , said despite recent volatility , the IPC clearly has defined a range between 3 , 120 points , when buying starts , and 3 , 400 points , when selling sets in . Even though Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo early Tuesday announced that open unemployment reached a 22 - month low of 4 . 8 percent , the stock market showed little immediate reaction . " You might say that now that several positive indicators have come out together and that interest rates in the United States have been defined , it could start to be taken into consideration " positively on the Mexican bolsa , a dealer said . Topping the list of gainers was Sidek ' s B series , which rose 19 percent or 12 centavos ( 2 cents ) to 75 centavos ( 10 cents ) after the troubled steel company won a seven - month extension to negotiate with its bank creditors . Grupo Financiero Bancomer ' s B shares picked up 26 centavos ( 3 cents ) to three pesos ( $ 0 . 38 ) after winning a BB rating from Standard & Poor ' s for its dollar - denominated debt . Tribasa rose 1 . 05 pesos ( 13 cents ) to 21 . 15 pesos ( $ 2 . 69 ) after announcing that it won a $ 3 . 5 million contract in Chile . On the losing side transport firm TMM ' s A shares fell 10 . 20 pesos ( $ 1 . 30 ) to 39 . 80 pesos ( $ 5 . 06 ) on expectations that it must invest heavily in a new railroad concession that it recently won by bidding 11 . 07 billion pesos ( $ 1 . 4 billion ) on a formerly state - owned rail line . TMM and U . S . partner Kansas City Southern Industries Inc . have not said how how they plan finance their investment . Of 107 stocks traded on Tuesday , 62 rose and 23 fell .

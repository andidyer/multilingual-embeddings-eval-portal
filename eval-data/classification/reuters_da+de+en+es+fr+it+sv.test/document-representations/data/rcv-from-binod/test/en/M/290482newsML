LIFFE cocoa ends at session ' s lows on origin sales . Cocoa futures ended at session ' s lows on Tuesday on origin hedge selling inspired by the weak French franc against sterling . " The continuation of the weak franc versus sterling is making it more attractive for sellers , " said one trader . " More new crop is being hedged , " he said . Traders said sentiment was also undermined by slightly disappointing Dutch fourth quarter 1996 cocoa grind data . " Also the trade is showing more longs than expected , " the trader said . By the close , most - active March stood eight stg down at the day ' s low of 887 stg a tonne . Overall volume was 3 , 431 lots , with March accounting for 1 , 919 lots . The fourth quarter Dutch cocoa grind figure showed a rise of 3 . 90 percent over the same period in 1995 . The trade had anticipated a rise of five percent . Market prices are unlikely to show any sharp movements unless the U . K . and German grind data , expected later this week or early next week , differ sharply from expectations . " Unless something drastic happens with the U . K . and German ( grinds ) I don ' t think it ' ll have an effect , " the trader said . Technically , analysts said if March were to show more strength than of late it would be hard pressed to break through a swathe of resistance reaching into a heavy supply area around 940 stg . On the downside , support is seen at 880 , which is expected to hold . - - Jalil Hamid , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4985

Russian Svyazinvest capital to be 19 trln rbls . Russia will almost triple the capital of state telecoms holding company OAO Svyazinvest with the transfer of government stakes in four companies to its balance sheets , Svyazinvest said on Wednesday . " By all appearances the charter capital will increase to about 19 trillion roubles - - not through new share issues but when the stakes have been re - registered in accordance with the president ' s April decree and the government ' s ( May 23 ) order , " Svyazinvest chief executive Nail Izmailov told Reuters . Svyazinvest ' s current capital is about seven trillion roubles . Last month President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on reorganising the management of state holdings in Svyazinvest and four other companies - - long - distance operator Rostelekom , Tsentralny Telegraf , local phone company Yekaterinburgskaya Gorodskaya Telefonnaya Set and telecoms consultant Giprosvyaz . And a government order dated May 23 calls for an increase in the capital of Svyazinvest , a 25 percent plus one share stake in which is due to be auctioned off , probably next month . Izmailov said government stakes in the four companies had not yet been formally transferred to Svyazinvest . He said the increase in capital would not require approval by shareholders . - - Irina Demchenko , Moscow Newsroom , + 7095 941 8520

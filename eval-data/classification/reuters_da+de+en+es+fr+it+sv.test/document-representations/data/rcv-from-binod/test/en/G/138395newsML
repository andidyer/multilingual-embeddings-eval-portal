NZ powerbroker holds talks with both main parties . New Zealand powerbroker Winston Peters held coalition talks with both leading political parties on Wednesday in a bid to break the deadlock from an inconclusive general election . Peters , Maori leader of the nationalist New Zealand First party , held a first meeting with the centre - left Labour Party and three hours of talks , the second round to date , with the caretaker National Party government . Asked how long the talks would take , Peters replied : " I said on election night six weeks . I think we can do it within that timeframe and conclude the coalition government satisfactorily . That ' s our expectation , that ' s our hope . " He said in reply to another question that the rise of the New Zealand dollar , which hit an eight - year high on Tuesday , lent urgency to the talks . Peters has consistently said the kiwi dollar needs driving down to help exporters . New Zealand ' s first election under proportional representation 11 days ago left Peters holding the balance of power between Labour and National . National , in power since 1990 , won 44 seats and its allies on the right won nine , while Labour and the left - wing Alliance won 50 . New Zealand First gained 17 in the 120 - member parliament . All sides have remained tight - lipped about the negotiations . Richard Prebble , leader of the radical free - market Act New Zealand Party which supports National , told reporters he did not believe Peters would do a deal with either main party . " My prediction is that Mr Peters isn ' t going to side with either party . The moment he sides with either he will lose about a third of his supporters , " Prebble said , predicting a minority National party government would emerge .

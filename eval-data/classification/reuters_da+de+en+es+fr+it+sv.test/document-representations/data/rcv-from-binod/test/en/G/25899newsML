Mexican army faces tough test with new rebels . A new guerrilla group in Mexico is likely to be a far greater military threat to the Mexican armed forces than the rebellion by Zapatista rebels in southern Chiapas state , analysts say . Rebels of the leftist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) stunned Mexicans on Aug . 28 by launching coordinated attacks in at least three states - - Oaxaca , Guerrero and the state of Mexico - - killing 14 people and wounding 20 . On Friday one soldier was killed and two were wounded after a group of 40 to 50 heavily armed men attacked a military convoy in the western state of Michoacan , media reports said . It was not clear if the Friday attack involved the EPR or drug traffickers . Although no one believes the rebels would be a match for Mexico ' s approximately 150 , 000 - strong army in head - on battle , the EPR seems versed in classic hit - and - run guerrilla tactics that will make it an elusive target . " Fighting and fleeing . . . . Our mobility has not given the Mexican army an open front to attack , it has frustrated their battle plan , " the rebels ' Commander Vicente said in a recent interview with Proceso magazine . A negative factor for the rebels may prove to be a lack of popular support . Although many Mexicans dislike the government of President Ernesto Zedillo and have been hard hit by a recession , most are against violence and wary of the EPR ' s Marxist rhetoric . So far the EPR has lived up to its claims to be a highly mobile and well - armed group . It has made its presence known through attacks or propaganda acts in at least eight states in poorer areas of central and southern Mexico , officials said . By contrast , the Zapatista rebels who launched a 1994 rebellion were largely confined to one corner of the southernmost state of Chiapas . The Zapatistas are currently negotiating peace with the government . " The EPR will have an impact far beyond their numbers . . . . The Zapatistas are larger in numbers , but they are easier to control , because they are confined to a much smaller area , " said Roderic Camp , an expert on the Mexican military at the University of Tulane . Camp said Mexico ' s military might not be quick to resort to the " dirty war " tactics used by Latin American armed forces in the 1970s because of increased international attention on human rights . Counterinsurgency efforts in several parts of Mexico will prevent the military from focusing on anti - drug efforts , which the U . S . government has pressed Mexico to pursue . " The Mexican military is not big in numbers for the size of the country or its population . They will be pretty spread out if they have to hunt rebels in several states , " Camp said . The EPR has a modern arsenal of assault rifles such as AK - 47s , AR - 15s and submachine guns , compared with the Zapatistas ' mostly ancient collection of rifles and guns , analysts said . Officials suspect the new rebel group , which appeared two months ago in Guerrero , obtained money from kidnappings , including the high - profile abduction of a rich banker in 1994 that yielded a reported ransom of $ 5 million to $ 35 million .

Peru siege talks creep forward , hostages hear Mass . Roman Catholic Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani visited the Japanese ambassador ' s home on Sunday to hold Mass for 72 hostages held by Marxist rebels and said talks to end the 117 - day siege were creeping forward . Cipriani , part of a three - man panel overseeing talks between the rebels and government , entered the residence at midday wearing his ankle - length black robe and trailed behind him a black suitcase containing the sacraments . He reappeared two hours later but had no comment for waiting journalists . Cipriani was believed to have met with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini inside the besieged mansion . Before entering the compound , Cipriani said that despite a pact of silence between the two sides , the negotiations were making gradual progress . " The talks go on advancing , " he told reporters . " We are in a stage of ( giving out ) very little information . We must not give out any information . " The archbishop passed lines of police , who - - anxious to end the 16 - week - old siege - - wore black T - shirts bearing a " Rescue of the Hostages " slogan and a picture of four officers descending on ropes from an airborne helicopter . While Cipriani delivered spiritual support to the men , most of whom are middle - aged , only a few blocks away the hostages ' relatives attended a Mass given for the captives . " We have come to pray close to them . We are so close to them and yet so far , " said Beatriz de Gumucio , wife of captive Bolivian ambassador Jorge Gumucio . " We are calling for a solution . The government has to open its ears . The government and the country have to listen to us , " said Luisa de Sivina , wife of hostage and Supreme Court justice Hugo Sivina . But Bolivia ' s acting ambassador to Peru had comforting words for the families , saying the sides were edging slowly toward a bloodless end . " I believe the negotiations are progressing very well and we have a certain optimism , " Eloy Avila , of Bolivia , told reporters . Police also believe that rebel leader Cerpa wants to end the siege peacefully , according to a report obtained by Reuters based on an analysis of handwritten notes found in the home ' s garbage . Other clues gleaned from notes in the garbage indicate Cerpa is self - controlled , rational , and would prefer to end the siege peacefully , according to a police document obtained by Reuters . However , " satisfying his ego is a powerful sentiment that feeds his motivation , " the police report states . " He probably wants to be remembered as a hero that achieved his goals without bloodshed , " the three - page report concludes . Cipriani has carried out daily shuttle diplomacy this week between President Alberto Fujimori ' s office and the residence in the rich suburb of San Isidro . Sources close to the talks say negotiations are zeroing in on the rebels ' demand of freedom for jailed comrades in exchange for their captives . Fujimori has publicly ruled out releasing any MRTA prisoners . But sources close to the talks said the two sides were haggling over a compromise settlement . The sources saw no chance of Fujimori agreeing to the release of convicted MRTA fighters . But there was room for possible sentence reductions for low - ranking MRTA prisoners , or release of those detained but not convicted , they said . Fujimori has arranged political asylum for the rebels in Cuba and the Dominican Republic in the event of a peaceful outcome . About 20 MRTA rebels swept into the Japanese ambassador ' s home during a cocktail party on Dec . 17 and took all 500 guests hostage . They gradually released all but 72 of them , keeping Peru ' s foreign minister , Fujimori ' s brother and top Japanese businessmen .

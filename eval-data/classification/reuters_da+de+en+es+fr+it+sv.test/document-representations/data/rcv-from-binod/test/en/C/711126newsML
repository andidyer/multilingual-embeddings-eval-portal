Belco withdraws bid for Hugoton . Belco Oil & Gas Corp said Monday it had withdrawn its offer to acquire Hugoton Energy Corp . On June 30 Belco said it had offered to acquire Wichita - based Hugoton for $ 15 a share - - $ 5 in cash and $ 10 in Belco stock - - subject to due diligence . Belco gave no reason for withdrawing its bid . Belco already owns a 14 . 9 percent stake in Hugoton , which had appointed Petrie Parkman & Co to evaluate strategic alternatives , including the possibility of a merger . Belco said it had released Hugoton from an exclusive negotiations pact that had been due to last until July 11 . A spokeswoman for Belco said there were not enough synergies to justify a merger . She said Belco would either keep its stake in Hugoton or possibly sell it to another company . Hugoton earlier this year withdrew a share offering because of adverse market conditions .

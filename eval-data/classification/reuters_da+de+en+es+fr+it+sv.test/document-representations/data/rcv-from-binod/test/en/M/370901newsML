Australian stocks end steady with focus on results . The Australian share market edged its way to a fractionally firmer close on Tuesday with soft finishes offshore having little impact as local players focussed squarely on upcoming interim profit results . The All Ordinaries index was added 1 . 7 points to 2 , 448 . 1 . For all but the first 30 minutes , the benchmark indicator spent the day rangebound in a six point trading band , with the leaders narrowly mixed as investors awaited company results . " Profit results are all coming out so you would expect people to be pretty watchful , " said analyst David Perry of Austock Brokers , although he added that the broader market had turned in a strong showing given the dip in the Dow and weaker base metals prices . " You would have to say it is a pretty solid performance . " Other players said the domestic market appeared to have decoupled itself from Wall Street at least temporarily , although persistent U . S . weakness would shake confidence , irrespective of company results . " We seem to be doing our own thing a bit , " said broker Robin Forbes of Hartley Poynton . " But it has certainly got a feeling it could go down if the Dow fell for a few days running . " Gawler Craton gold region ringleader Helix Resources was one of the day ' s losers with drilling results not meeting what some broker said were unrealistically high expectations . Its shares plunged to close A $ 1 . 26 ( US $ 0 . 96 ) lower at A $ 3 . 727 . In the industrials , Bank of Melbourne lost ground , its scrip closing 25 cents lower at A $ 8 . 65 , after a flat first half net profit of A $ 40 . 1 million . Rural and energy group Wesfarmers jumped sharply , its shares closing 25 cents up at A $ 9 . 65 , after Monday ' s 47 . 8 percent higher first half operating profit of A $ 90 . 3 million and 18 percent higher interim dividend of 20 cents per share . Other features remained elusive with most of the leaders finishing narrowly weaker while marginally firmer big banks propped the industrials and overall market . The exception was the recent star of the show , Commonwealth Bank , whose shares finally lost some ground after its record breaking run . Its shares ended 17 cents lower at A $ 13 . 59 with its first half profit results due on Wednesday . Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to eight , while about 30 percent of stocks traded remained steady . ( A $ 1 = US $ 0 . 76 )

Danish biker leader offers to end gang war . The leader of Denmark ' s Bandidos motorcycle gang , locked in a bloody war against the rival Hell ' s Angels for almost three years , offered a truce on Thursday saying the war risked harming innocent people . " We want it stopped , because it is hurting many innocent biker clubs and can hurt many innocent people , as well , " Bandidos President Jim Tinndahn told Danish state television . Tinndahn said he did not know who carried out an October 6 missile attack on Hell ' s Angels ' Copenhagen headquarters , which killed two people and wounded 19 . He indicated that a recent spate of bomb , grenade , machine gun and rocket attacks on Hell ' s Angels ' strongholds were the work of rogue bikers not under his orders . " The Bandidos think that this has gone too far and are trying to send a message to those people on the fringe , that we do not exactly have control over , that are doing these things , " he said . Hell ' s Angels declined to comment on the offer .

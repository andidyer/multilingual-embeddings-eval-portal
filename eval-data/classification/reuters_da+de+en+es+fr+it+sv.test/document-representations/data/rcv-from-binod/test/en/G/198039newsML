RTRS - Australian Labor , Democrats may unite on native title . Australian non - government parties may combine to force changes to the government ' s proposed native land ownership legislation , opposition Labor spokesman Daryl Melham said on Monday . Labor and Australian Democrats members of a parliamentary committee backed a report calling for changes to the government ' s proposed legislation , which would itself alter the native title system set up by the former Labor government . " ( Democrats leader Cheryl ) Kernot signed off on all aspects of the Labor minority report , " Melham told reporters . The government does not control the Senate . Labor and the Democrats can get the bill amended if three of the other four Independent and Greens senators join them . Melham said under the government ' s bill approvals for land developments could be delayed by Aborigines pursuing their common law rights through the courts . The minority report recommended against the bill ' s : - - Registration test for native title applications that would make them more difficult to administer by the Native Title Tribunal ; - - Denying the right to negotiate over development proposals by applicants who do not pass a test for registration ; - - Providing for a once - only right to negotiate over development proposals , effectively covering exploration and mining , and denying native title holders the use of the land ; - - Allowing the minister to intervene in certain circumstances , effectively denying the right to negotiate ; - - Giving the minister authority to permit a development on native title land ; - - Limiting mediation to matters that could be litigated in a court ; - - Limiting the right to negotiate to four months from six months before arbitration over mining could begin ; - - Ending Aborigines ' right to stop expedited processing of developments by claiming merely spiritual interference , rather than physical interference ; - - Authorisation of the minister to recognise or deny recognition of native title representative bodies on grounds that the minority report called inadequate . Melham said he would raise the minority recommendations with his Labor party colleagues shortly . The bill , the Native Title Amendment Bill will be debated in the lower house of parliament , the House of Representatives , on December 2 . - - Canberra bureau 61 - 6 273 - 2730

NZCC declines Radio Network clearance to buy C93FM . The anti - monopolies Commerce Commission on Monday declined to clear Radio Network New Zealand Ltd ' s attempt to buy Christchurch radio station C93FM . The Commisssion said it had carefully considered the Radio Network ' s undertaking that it would divest , within one year , all its interests and rights in 94 . 5 FM , which is one of the licences it would acquire from C93FM . " In looking at the divestment undertaking , the Commission concluded that the one frequency , which currently has a very small market share , was insufficient to allow a new entrant or an existing competitor to constrain Radio Network should it acquire C93FM , " The Commission said in a statement . " Even with the divestment , the Commission was not satisfied that Radio Network would not acquire or strengthen a dominant position in the market for radio advertising services in Christchurch . " This was the second time the commission has declined clearance to Radio Network to acquire C93FM . The first application , declined in March , did not include the divestment undertaking . The Radio Network is owned by a consortium comprising Wilson and Horton , Australian Provincial Newspapers and U . S . - based Clear Channel Communications . - - Wellington newsroom + 64 4 471 4273

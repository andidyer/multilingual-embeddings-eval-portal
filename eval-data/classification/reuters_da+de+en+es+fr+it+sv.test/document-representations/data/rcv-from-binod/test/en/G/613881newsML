Two HK Diaoyu isles activists heading for Taiwan . Two Hong Kong activists who leapt aboard a Japanese patrol boat during a protest voyage to the disputed Senkaku or Diaoyu isles , were on their way to Taiwan on Monday on a Taiwanese vessel , the Hong Kong government said . " They are now on their way to Taiwan , " a government spokesman said after Hong Kong made contact with Japanese authorities about the status of the two men . Earlier the Hong Kong government said it was arranging the return of the activists , adding the two men were unharmed . The two leapt onto a Japanese vessel from their protest ship named " Protect - the - Diaoyus " when the two boats collided as Hong Kong and Taiwanese vessels attempted to break through a cordon of Japanese vessels around the disputed islands in the East China Sea . The dispute is over islands called the Senkakus in Japanese and the Diaoyus in Chinese , which are roughly equidistant between Taiwan and Japan ' s southern island chain of Okinawa .

CRICKET - OPENERS GIVE INDIA SOUND THIRD TEST START . Openers Nayan Mongia and Woorkeri Raman gave India a sound start in the third and final test against South Africa at Kanpur ' s Green Park on Sunday . The two put on 76 runs in the first session without being separated . At lunch , Mongia was batting on 41 and Raman on 34 . Left - handed Raman , 31 , last played a test in 1992 during India ' s maiden visit to South Africa . He was recalled for this match to replace Sanjay Manjrekar as the selectors continued their hunt for reliable openers . Raman was the more aggressive of the pair , striking seven boundaries from 77 balls during his two - hour stay at the wicket . Mongia scored briskly by picking up singles and twos , and hit five boundaries from 91 balls . The South African bowlers kept the Indian openers quiet but failed to extract much bounce or movement from the pitch .

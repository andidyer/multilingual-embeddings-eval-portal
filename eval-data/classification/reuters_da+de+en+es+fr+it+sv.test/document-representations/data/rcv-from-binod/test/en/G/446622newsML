Yeltsin meets PM , deputy to mull cabinet reshuffle . President Boris Yeltsin met Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his first deputy Anatoly Chubais on Monday in the latest of consultations on forming a new Russian government , Itar - Tass news agency said . The agency gave no details of the meeting which took place hours after Yeltsin made a surprise offer to the liberal governor of Nizhny Novgorod , Boris Nemtsov , 37 , to become a first deputy prime minister alongside Chubais , 41 . " Two first deputy premiers together with Chernomyrdin should form a youthful cabinet , " Yeltsin said in remarks broadcast by Russian Television . " I will help them in a most decisive and firm way . " Yeltsin said Nemtsov had accepted the offer . Tass said Nemtsov did not attend the meeting . Yeltsin , worried by the growing tension caused by chronic delays in wages and the government ' s inability to handle the crisis , has told Chernomyrdin to review the structure of the cabinet and dramatically improve its performance . But neither the line - up nor the structure of the new cabinet have been made public since Yeltsin ordered the government reshuffle in his state of the nation address on March 6 . Yeltsin is expected to announce the new cabinet later on Monday or on Tuesday .

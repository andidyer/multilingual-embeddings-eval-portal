Judge tells Tokyo gas attack guru to make plea . The presiding judge in the trial of the doomsday cult guru accused of a Tokyo subway gas attack told the defendent on Thursday to prepare to make a plea later this month . Presiding judge Fumihiro Abe told Shoko Asahara , founder of Aum Shinri Kyo ( Supreme Truth Sect ) , that he could consult his lawyers before entering pleas in connection with murder charges in the March 1995 sarin nerve gas attack and the 1989 killings of anti - cult lawyer Tsutsumi Sakamoto , his wife and baby son . " I want you to give testimony on April 24 about the sarin incident and the Sakomoto incident , " Abe told Asahara during Thursday ' s hearing at Tokyo Disctrict Court . " You will also have the chance to say what you want to say about all the charges brought against you , " he added . Asahara , whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto , is on trial for a total of 16 counts ranging from murder to weapons and drug production . He has been accused of masterminding the March 20 , 1995 , gas attack , which killed 12 people and made 6 , 000 others ill . Cult leader Asahara talked over Abe ' s statements in a loud , unintelligible monologue , his first such outburst during Thursday ' s hearing . In previous hearings , Asahara interrupted proceedings with bizarre behaviour which on several occasions led to his ejection from court . However , throughout Thursday ' s proceedings the long - bearded guru , dressed in a dark - blue prison tracksuit , appeared to be almost asleep , waking up from time to time to make incomprehensible utterances in his low , booming voice . Judge Abe told Asahara that Friday ' s hearing was cancelled . " I ' m cancelling tomorrow ' s hearing so you still have time at hand to meet your lawyers and make your preparations , " he said . Asahara , who claims he is an incarnation of the Hindu god Shiva , is on trial on a total of 16 counts , ranging from murder to weapons and drugs production . If he is found guilty on the murder charges he faces a mandatory death sentence by hanging .

Steel prices up , but next year a worry - analysts . Steel prices have continued their upward climb this year and are higher than levels seen in last year ' s fourth quarter , buoyed by production outages and a strike at WHX Corp , industry analysts and sources said . But sources said prices could be in jeopardy next year , when supply pressure from new domestic capacity will put the squeeze on them . " Prices are a lot higher now compared to a year ago , " said Chuck Bradford at UBS Securities . He said hot - rolled sheet , a commodity product , in some cases is $ 50 to $ 60 higher per ton versus last year ' s fourth quarter . Following a steep drop last year caused by heavy discounting by steelmakers , prices this year have been rising while demand has been strong . Steelmakers called for three price hikes this year and managed to partially push them through to customers . Fourth - quarter pricing has been buoyed by temporary production outages at some steelmakers for equipment maintenance and an ongoing strike by the United Steelworkers union at WHX Corp that began October 1 . The resulting missing production has had a tightening effect on the domestic market , analysts said . " I think about six percent of the market is off - line right now , " said Aldo Mazzaferro at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . But analysts and industry sources said new capacity due in the market next year could wreak havoc . A manager at one large Southeast steel distributor said he is paying about $ 320 to $ 325 per ton for hot - rolled sheet , compared with $ 300 per ton last year . " Everybody ' s feeling is that pricing is going to be firm in the ( upcoming ) first quarter , " he said . " But everybody ' s worried about what ' s going to happen after that . " New capacity from upstart minimills and production expansions at existing companies including Nucor Corp will combine to bring about three to four million more tons of steel in the domestic market by the middle of next year . " The real problem could be in the third quarter , " Bradford said . Much of the new capacity will be hot - rolled steel . To cushion themselves from supply pressure , some steelmakers including USX - U . S . Steel Group and AK Steel Holding Corp have been shifting production away from hot - rolled products and concentrating more of it on value - added products including cold - rolled and galvanized steel .

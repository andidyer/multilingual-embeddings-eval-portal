FEATURE - Bulgarian satire flourishes despite tough media law . Bulgaria ' s popular satirical weekly television show Kanaleto is back on the air after a four - month break and finding ever more creative ways to get around tough laws restricting political coverage . Lyuben Dilov , one of Kanaleto ' s three writers and producers , said the show ' s contract with national television bound them to obey the media law , which he said effectively barred private producers from covering current events . " This is why we use metaphors to get round it , " he said . Barred from criticising the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party , the Kanaleto team invites outspoken studio guests to do it for them . One gag - - reviving traditional folk songs from the period of Ottoman rule full of calls to rise up and fight the oppressor - - has produced a spin - off album . Originally known as Cuckoo , the show was launched soon after the end of one - party rule , and Dilov said it had always been subject to political pressure from all sides . It was relaunched as Kanaleto - - a pun linking the words for " TV channel " and " sewer " - - in 1995 . Kanaleto was taken off the air in the run - up to last October ' s presidential elections and came back the following month . Dilov quoted figures from the local branch of the Gallup polling agency showing 4 . 5 million Bulgarians out of a population of 8 . 4 million watch the Sunday night show . " This is why the politicians are so afraid of us , " he said . POLITICIANS MISTRUSTEDBulgarians , confronting severe economic crisis increasingly distrust politicians who have failed to keep promises of a brighter future , whether under socialism or Western - style social democracy . Powerful business interests have stepped into the gap between the two and corruption is rife . Satire offers Bulgarians relief from the awful realities of everyday life . Annual inflation was forecast to reach about 280 percent by the end of 1996 and the national currency , the lev , has fallen from 70 to the dollar last January to more than 500 now . Prime Minister Zhan Videnov promises the 1997 budget will be accompanied by tough structural reform measures , which his critics , including the International Monetary Fund , say should have been implemented years ago . " Politicians don ' t speak a language people understand , they ' re isolated from reality , " Dilov said . " We speak the language of ordinary people . " EX - COMMUNISTS BEAR BRUNT OF SATIREThe ruling Socialist Party , a major target of the show ' s satire , was formed by leading members of the Bulgarian Communist Party who hastily renamed themselves after communist leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted in 1989 . During the presidential elections , Kanaleto handed the satire baton to comedians Hristo Boichev and Ivan Koulekov , who ran a highly successful campaign which attracted protest votes from those disillusioned with the two main parties . They came fifth out of 13 candidates with 1 . 3 percent of the vote . Many Bulgarians , made cynical by seven years of political infighting and lip service to reform , said Boichev and Koulekov ' s nightly campaign spots on national television were the only ones which told the truth about the country ' s crisis . One of the duo ' s campaign promises was that Kanaleto would replace the nightly television news . Dilov said Bulgarians , no strangers to hardship , had developed their particular sense of humour in response to 800 years of foreign rule , under the Byzantine , Ottoman and Soviet empires . " The mixture of the funny and the tragic is peculiar to Bulgarian humour , " he said . Another spin - off from the show , the National Cuckoo Movement , was banned from contesting the 1994 parliamentary election because the court objected to the party ' s name . " Two of our actors were granted political asylum by a court in Dallas , " Dilov said . " Now we ' re constantly getting requests for forged membership cards . " DROPPING BANANA SKINSCuckoo caused a scandal with a 1992 show which announced that " something had happened " at the Kozloduy nuclear plant . Many Bulgarians , used to the communist system where the official media only hinted at the truth , assumed the worst . In another famous spoof , the show got two Africans to pose as journalists and ask members of parliament about Bulgarian - Nubian relations . Vasil Mihailov , a member of parliament ' s foreign affairs committee from the opposition Union of Democratic Forces , spoke enthusiastically about the need for stronger ties , apparently oblivious to the fact that Nubia does not exist . Ever since , he has been know as " The Nubian " . The joke was revived during October ' s presidential election campaign when Boichev and Koulekov visited the Nubian ambassador for one of their campaign spots . He promised them $ 50 billion worth of aid and gave them a ceremonial banana .

Kmart sells Canada unit for C $ 185 mln ( $ 134 mln ) . Kmart Corp . on Monday sold most of its money - losing Canadian discount retail chain to an investor group for C $ 185 million ( $ 134 million ) . Troy , Mich . - based Kmart had been seeking to sell Kmart Canada Co . for about two years . Kmart Canada lost C $ 4 million ( $ 2 . 8 million ) in the first quarter ended April 30 , versus a breakeven year - earlier period . Analysts said the ownership change did not ensure smooth selling for Canada ' s sixth biggest department store chain . Buyers of the 123 - store retailer were York Management Services Inc . , Cherokee Ventures Canada Inc . and a unit of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec , a government - owned public pension fund manager . Cherokee is a member of Denver - based investment firm Cherokee Group of Companies , while York is a New Jersey - based investment and management firm . Kmart maintained a 12 . 5 percent stake in Kmart Canada and said it did not see the deal resulting in further writedowns of the Canadian operation . Congress Financial Corp . provided a C $ 135 million ( $ 97 million ) line of credit to Kmart Canada , which has been losing market share for years and holds about eight percent of the market . Canadian retailers have struggled for the past few years due to an economic downturn and the 1994 arrival of Wal - Mart Canada Inc . , a subsidiary of the world ' s largest retailer Wal - Mart Stores Inc . . Wal - Mart now has the biggest slice of the Canadian department store market , at 24 percent , followed by Zellers Inc . , a unit of Hudson ' s Bay Co . , at 23 percent . William Chisholm , analyst with brokerage Deacon Capital , said the credit line would help prop up the retailer in the short run . But he said the new managers might not succeed where Kmart failed . " If Kmart themselves couldn ' t see turning it around longerterm and making it an attractive business , it doesn ' t sound to me as though this group would be that much smarter . " Consultant Richard Talbot said the new management must turn Kmart Canada around after years of neglect when the chain was on the block . " It ' s not impossible to turn it around , " Talbot said , " but they have to be come far more focused and far more sophisticated than they are right now . " The new owners appointed George Heller as Kmart Canada chief executive . Heller is a former Zellers executive and was most recently a senior executive with privately held Canadian shoe company Bata Industries . Kmart Canada posted 1996 sales of more than C $ 1 . 1 billion ( $ 794 million ) , and employed 12 , 600 full and part - time workers .

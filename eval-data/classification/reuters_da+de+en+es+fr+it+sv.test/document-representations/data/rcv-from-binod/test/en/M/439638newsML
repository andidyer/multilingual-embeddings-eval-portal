Soybean , coffee prices close lower , crude oil firm . Soybean prices closed lower on Thursday as rumors swirled about imports of Brazilian soybeans into the United States , the world ' s largest soybean producer . Soybeans , which hit an 8 - 1 / 2 year high earlier this week at the Chicago Board of Trade amid booming demand from domestic processors , on Wednesday had fallen nearly the 30 cent per bushel limit when a trading house , Glencore , said it had sold 45 , 000 metric tons of soybeans to a U . S . buyer . On Thursday March soybeans closed another 1 - 1 / 2 cents a bushel lower at $ 8 . 21 , after trading as low as $ 8 . 12 . After the close of trading Thursday , a small Kentucky processor , Owensboro Grain Co , confirmed that it had bought 150 , 000 tons of " optional origin " soybeans this week - - meaning the beans could come from the United States or from other producers including Brazil , Argentina or Paraguay . " This market is still showing a negative tone left from yesterday ' s heavy break , " said Jason Roose , analyst with U . S . Commodities . " South American prices are a lot cheaper and we ' re coming into harvest . At these high levels , are we going to be competitive ? " Soybeans are processed or " crushed " to produce soymeal , a high - protein livestock feed , and soyoil , widely used in food and industrial products . The U . S . Agriculture Department on March 11 estimated that U . S . processors would crush a record 1 . 42 billion bushels in the year to September 1 on booming demand . March corn futures closed up 3 cents a bushel at $ 3 . 00 - 3 / 4 after the Agriculture Department reported higher than expected export sales of 1 . 009 million tons in the week to March 6 . Traders had expected sales of 700 , 000 to 800 , 000 tons and the news calmed some fears that China , which has registered large recent sales to South Korea , may hurt U . S . exports . " It ' s coming back and the export sales were good , " said analyst Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter . At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York , coffee prices fell sharply on an easing in supply concerns . May coffee closed down 13 . 85 cents per pound at 182 . 25 cents , a drop of seven percent on the day . " The fundamentals are slowly changing , " said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka . " Higher prices for coffee will bring more coffee into the market . Colombia is selling old - crop coffee to make money . Brazil is selling old - crop coffee to make money . " He pointed to a report from the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters saying Brazilian coffee exports so far this year have reached 2 . 33 million 132 - pound bags , nearly twice the 1 . 18 million bags shipped in the first two months of 1996 . Since early December , coffee futures prices have nearly doubled as worries about low stock levels in both consuming and producing nations , coupled with projections for smaller crops in many Latin American countries , fueled supply woes . At the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude oil prices rose on indications that imports from Europe would slow . April crude oil ended at $ 20 . 70 a barrel , up 8 cents . North Sea loadings of Britain ' s benchmark Brent crude oil were scheduled to slow down in April , traders said . " The Brent loading program assisted us here as the strength in London was carried over to the NYMEX , " said Prudential Securities oil market analyst Richard Redash . In refined products , a cold snap expected to hit the northeastern United States early next week boosted heating oil prices . April heating oil ended 0 . 14 cent per gallon higher at 54 . 22 cents , while April gasoline closed 0 . 40 cent per gallon lower at 64 . 23 cents .

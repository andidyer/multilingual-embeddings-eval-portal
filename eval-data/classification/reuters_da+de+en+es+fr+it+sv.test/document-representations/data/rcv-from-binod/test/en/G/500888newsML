German court says Iran ' s leaders ordered killings . A German court accused Iran on Thursday of ordering political killings in Berlin and indicated President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were involved . The court avoided names but said Iran ' s Committee for Special Operations ordered the crime and described its members as the state president , the country ' s religious leader , the Ministry of Intelligence and other security officials . Prosecutors had said Khamenei ordered the killings and that Rafsanjani approved the slaying of the group of Iranian Kurdish leaders in Berlin ' s Mykonos restaurant in 1992 . The court ' s comments looked sure to infuriate the Islamic republic , which has denied all responsibility for the murders . The German government , which fears a sharp worsening of relations with Iran , declined to comment until after it had heard the full verdict . More than 1 , 000 Iranian exiles outside the court cheered , sang and danced when they heard the news . " The Iranian political leadership ordered this crime , " presiding judge Frithjof Kubsch said as he read out the long opinion following the verdict . " Decisions taken in the Committee for Special Operations are a precondition for attacks carried out abroad . " Kubsch handed down life sentences on Kazem Darabi , an Iranian , and Abbas Rhayel , a Lebanese , for the murders of Sadegh Sharafkandi , exiled leader of the Iranian Democratic Party of Kurdistan , two other party officials and a translator . Two other Lebanese received prison sentences of between five and 11 years for being accomplices . A fifth suspect was cleared . Germany has issued an arrest warrant for Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan . Kubsch cited as evidence a television interview that Fallahiyan gave in August 1992 in which he boasted of Iran ' s success in making " decisive strikes " against opposition groups . " They made a decision to silence an uncomfortable voice , " Kubsch said . " This is an official liquidation measure ordered without a verdict . " Other evidence included a pistol used in the attack , which came from the arsenals of the former Shah ' s army , and the fact that Iranian forces in the country ' s Kurdish region were put on alert two days before the killings , he added . Outside the court , a cheer went up from the crowd when an official of the National Council of Resistance of Iran read out a statement from mujahideen leader Massoud Radjavi . " For years , there has hardly been any doubt about the role of the criminal mullah regime ' s leadership in terrorist acts , " he said . " Now a European court has for the first time named Khamenei and Rafsanjani as the masterminds of the attack in Berlin and Tehran ' s state terrorism . " Kubsch said Iran ' s Committee for Special Operations delegated Fallahiyan to execute the plan . His agents recruited a hit squad in Berlin led by Darabi , a former member of Iran ' s Islamic revolutionary guard . Germany , Iran ' s biggest trading partner and most important friend in the West , has until now doggedly maintained amicable relations while its major allies , particularly Britain and the United States , accuse Iran of state terrorism . Kubsch said the fact Iran had good relations with Germany had been no obstacle to ordering the attack . " The positive relations were useful as they suggested that ties would bear it even if Iran came under suspicion , " he said . Media reports said a Bonn working group expected Iran ' s reaction to the judgment to be limited if Tehran was mentioned only in general terms as the originator of the attack but to be much more severe if Rafsanjani or Khameni were named . Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was quoted by the Iranian daily Kayhan on Wednesday as saying that " a negative verdict by the Mykonos trial will have a negative impact on political and economic ties between Tehran and Bonn " . But he denied that pro - Iranian groups might attack German interests or German nationals in Iran , saying : " We support human values and German nationals will have full security . "

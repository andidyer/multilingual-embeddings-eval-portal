SOCCER - ENGLAND GIVE $ 34 , 000 TO MOLDOVAN ORPHANAGE . England players and the national soccer association have joined together to send 20 , 000 pounds ( $ 34 , 000 ) to help one of the poorest orphanages in the former Soviet state of Moldova , officials said on Wednesday . The money is intended for the Hincesti orphanage outside the capital Chisinau , where 150 girls - - some of whom are mentally and physically handicapped - - live in appalling conditions . Aid workers say 31 children died of cold there last winter . The players learned of the orphans ' plight after beating Moldova 3 - 0 in a World Cup qualifying match in September and decided to donate 10 , 000 pounds ( $ 17 , 000 ) . The Football Association ( FA ) then doubled the money . " Sport can break down so many different barriers , whether it be racism or whether it be something like this , " England coach Glenn Hoddle told BBC television . " As footballers , sometimes we are cocooned in our own little world and sometimes it is nice to maybe branch out from that little world and help those less fortunate . "

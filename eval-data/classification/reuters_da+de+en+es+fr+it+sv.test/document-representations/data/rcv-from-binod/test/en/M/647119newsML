CBOT rice futures end lower , hedging in September . CBOT rice futures ended lower Monday in extremely light volume , with September under slight pressure from hedging , traders said . " It was a very slow day , " said one pit trader . " But this time of year is typically slow . " Seasonally there is not much interest in the rice market because plantings are nearly complete and the trade is waiting for the crop to grow , traders said . Another commercial firm was noted buying July rice futures and selling them against new crop contracts , floor sources said . Activity in the market has also been quashed because many commercial dealers are attending a meeting of the Rice Millers Association in San Diego , traders said . Rice ended one to seven cents per cwt lower with July down seven at $ 11 . 45 . Volume was estimated by CBOT at 150 lots , compared with actual volume of 358 on Friday .

Marvel bondholders , Toy Biz agree on plan . Bondholders of Marvel Holdings Inc . said on Wednesday they reached an agreement with Toy Biz Inc . on a reorganization plan that would give Toy Biz 40 percent of the restructured company . The agreement comes one day after Toy Biz withdrew from a previous reorganization plan and would end a long squabble over control of the famous comic book maker . Under the new plan , Marvel and Toy Biz would become separate subsidiaries of a new holding company . Toy Biz shareholders would receive 40 percent of the new holding company ' s shares and Marvel shareholders would receive the remaining 60 percent . Marvel ' s bank creditors would receive $ 300 million in cash and the equity interest and assets of Marvel units Panini , which makes stickers , and Fleer / Skybox , which makes collector cards . Investor Carl Icahn and the other bondholders said that to infuse capital into the new holding company they would guarantee a rights offering to raise between $ 300 million and $ 500 million in a combination of debt and equity . The bondholders committee represents the owners of $ 894 million in bonds secured against 80 percent of Marvel ' s equity . Toy Biz originally had joined Marvel shareholders , led by Ronald Perelman , and the company ' s banks , in their competing reorganization plan . But Toy Biz withdrew from that plan on Tuesday after a federal judge ruled that the bondholders could vote their 80 percent share of the company .

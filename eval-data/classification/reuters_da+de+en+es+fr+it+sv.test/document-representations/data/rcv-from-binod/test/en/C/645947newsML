Air France head hopes for privatization . Air France Chairman Christian Blanc is hopeful he can convince the new French Socialist government to privatise the airline , despite a communist transport minister hostile to state sell - offs . " Christian Blanc is serene . He thinks that he can convince the government on the privatisation of Air France , " a spokeswoman for the flag carrier said Sunday . Jean - Claude Gayssot , the newly appointed transport minister , told French radio on Friday : " Nobody expects Gayssot will become the minister for privatisation , deregulation and ultra - liberalsm . . . I believe there is a role for the public service . " Blanc has long been eager to free Air France from what he sees as the dead hand of state control and run it as a " normal " commercial company . He has said he hopes for a privatisation later this year or early in 1998 . One of Blanc ' s proposals would involve selling 30 percent stakes in the airline to employees and the state , and five percent to each of its U . S . alliance partners , Delta Air Lines and Continental , the spokeswoman said . The size of the stakes for the U . S . carriers has not been finalised , she stressed . An aerospace executive said if Blanc could persuade the government to accept a partial privatisation of Air France , it would serve as a model for opening up defence electronics firm Thomson - CSF and France Telecom , two other companies slated for privatisation . Blanc has not yet met the transport minister and no meeting has so far been arranged , the spokeswoman said . Air France posted a net profit for 1997 of 394 million francs ( $ 67 . 7 million ) , its first since 1989 , despite the loss of 250 million francs ( $ 43 million ) from strikes . The return to the black was essential to preparing the airline for privatisation . That recovery was made possible by 20 billion francs ( $ 3 . 4 billion ) in state aid , used to repay debt , and which was approved by the European Commission in return for a restructuring plan and eventual privatisation .

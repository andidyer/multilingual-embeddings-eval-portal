Indian cement makers see little cheer in budget . Indian cement companies said there was little in the 1997 / 98 budget for them to cheer about . " We were hoping for direct reliefs - - like cement used for infrastructure projects being exempt from duties , " said T . M . M . Nambiar , managing director of Associated Cement Companies ( ACC ) , India ' s largest cement company . " In that sense the budget is a disappointment , " he said . He said the finance minister announced some measures to promote rural housing which in the long run could lead to increased demand for cement . A reduction in import duty on coal would help cement units on coastal India which import coal , Nambiar said . ACC ' s plant in Madukarai on the south eastern coast imports coal . Gujarat Ambuja Cements , another producer with a plant on the western Gujarat coast , is a major coal importer . Nambiar welcomed the reduction in corporate tax to 35 percent from 40 percent and abolition of double taxation on dividends announced as part of the budget proposals . India is the world ' s fourth largest cement maker . Cement consumption has decelerated in the second half of 1996 / 97 ( April - March ) , cement analysts said . Cement prices have been weakening in major Indian markets in recent months , analysts said . - - Shyam Kumar , Bombay newsroom + 91 - 22 - 265 9000

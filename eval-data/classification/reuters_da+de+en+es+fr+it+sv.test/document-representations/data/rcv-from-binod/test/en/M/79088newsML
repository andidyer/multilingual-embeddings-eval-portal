EU sets barley at $ 141 - 142 / tn , stays off market . The European Union stayed off the world barley market this week but sent traders a signal it may hold out for higher prices before covering key Saudi business . The EU ' s grain panel set an effective export price on barley , through tiny subsidised sales on Thursday , of some $ 141 to $ 142 per tonne fob Europe , grain traders said . Analysts say that price is too high for the trade to cover recent sales to Saudi Arabia , and nearly all bids for barley subsidy at the EU ' s weekly grain tender were rejected . Most of the 1 . 4 million tonnes or more of barley sold week was seen priced in the mid - $ 130s before freight and other costs . Traders expected the European Union would be eager to sell up to 800 , 000 tonnes or so of barley to grab the lion ' s share of the business and had bid at competitive prices accordingly . The highest subsidy bid of 38 . 47 Ecus per tonne was worth little more than $ 127 per tonne fob for October free - market barley exports , traders said . The EU rejected most bids and held the line at roughly the same export price it had last week . The EU grain panel in Brussels granted free - market exports of 5 , 000 tonnes of barley at 27 . 14 Ecus per tonne , equating to some $ 141 per tonne fob , and 8 , 307 tonnes of German intervention barley at 106 . 55 Ecus or $ 142 per tonne fob , traders said . The European Commission may still be uncomfortable with domestic prices , analysts suggested . Despite wobbling on Thursday , these have stayed firm for most of the week that has passed since Saudi Arabia ' s snap purchase tender for 1 . 7 million tonnes between October and December was launched last week . French Rouen - delivered barley was at 870 francs per tonne on Thursday , off the week ' s highs but well above the season ' s lows of 810 francs in mid - August .

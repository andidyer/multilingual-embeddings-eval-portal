Weak marine insurance rates spread - industry body . A surfeit of capacity is pulling marine insurance rates lower around the world and deepening the cyclical downturn in the market , a leading industry body said on Monday . " The soft market now apparent in most classes of marine insurance business is affecting all major underwriting centres , not just London , " Institute of London Underwriters ( ILU ) chairman Nigel Jones said in a statement . " Once again , and despite all the warning signs that have been posted for some time , market share is considered more important than realistic underwriting , " he added . Jones ' comments come a week before marine insurers from nearly 50 countries meet for the annual International Union of Marine Underwriters ( IUMI ) conference in Oslo from September 16 . Jones said that easily available reinsurance and a comparatively good year for marine casualties in 1995 had contributed to the downward pressure at a time when rates should be stabilising . " It is incredible to realise that all the painful lessons learned the last time the cycle changed have so quickly been forgotten or ignored . " " Things can change very quickly , and already this year there are indications that the casualty graph is turning sharply upwards , " Jones added . Half year casualty figures from the ILU , which represents many insurers in the important London Market , showed an increase over the first six months of 1995 , with the Institute expecting more losses to be confirmed later in the year . - - Reuters Insurance News 44 171 542 2769

Oil industry , aid crisis lifts UK - Africa air cargo . Oil industry demand in West Africa and the need for relief aid generated by the situation in Zaire are continuing to support ex - UK air cargo rates to Africa , industry sources told Reuters . Air Gabon ' s David Hall said business has continued to be " very busy since earlier this year " , with the carrier moving around 25 to 32 tonnes on its weekly Boeing 747 Combi flight from London to Libreville and Johannesburg . About 80 percent of cargo is destined for South Africa but oil industry demand stimulated by offshore exploration " has been getting busier all the time with lots of traffic from Houston " . Key destinations are Port Gentil and Pointe - Noire , he added . " We expect to stay busy until the summer holiday season . And we have also picked up diplomatic traffic from Washington and Baltimore , " Hall said . A similar trend was reported by DAS Air Cargo commercial director , Andy Leslie . The airline operates Boeing 707 freighter flights from London Gatwick to Lagos , Port Harcourt and Kano as well as Accra , Banjul and Freetown . " We ' re have interline agreements with all the major American carriers and we are moving substantial quantities of oil industry - related traffic from Houston , " Leslie said . Latest average ex - UK per kg rate for 100 kg to Libreville is around 2 . 42 stg compared to 2 . 41 stg previously . The far more competitive Lagos route is quoted at 0 . 97 stg , two pence up from earlier this month , while 0 . 85 stg per kg can easily be obtained for shipments over two tonnes . Jim Walsh , UK cargo manager of Cameroon Airlines , said although the West African airfreight market depended on seasonal shipments , he is experiencing steady , strong business based on oil industry and development project equipment . " Much of our cargo comprises heavy machinery bound for Third World countries . We are currently doing especially well providing supplies for an oil pipeline being laid between Chad and the port of Kribi , in southern Cameroon , " he said . From the UK , Cameroon Airlines is flying in oil production equipment including drills , building materials and parts required to assemble platforms . But he added that only 30 percent of the airline ' s ex - UK cargo capacity was devoted to the Cameroon market , with 60 percent of the space allocated to Nigeria - - " for mainly electrical and domestic equipment and personal and household effects " , he said . In the remaining 10 percent of space he said that television sets , hi - fi equipment , stereos and personal and household goods were flown for onward transportation from Douala to Libreville , Bangui and Brazzaville on B737 flights . On return flights from Douala , he said that freight mainly comprised mangoes , pineapples and green beans that were bound for the French rather than the UK market . The airline ' s weekly 40 - tonne capacity London Gatwick - Douala Boeing 747 Combi service is operated via Paris - CDG in both directions . Demand for Johannesburg is still strong despite stiff competition from the large number of carriers on the route . Rates have however eased slightly to an average of 1 . 55 stg a kg per 100 from 1 . 60 stg . " A lot of what we are carrying is consumer goods . . . mobile phones , videos and the like . Many South African are still kids when it comes to this type of product , " said Phil Thomsett , UK / Ireland manager of all - cargo Affretair . Business remains strong to East Africa and DAS Air ' s Andy Leslie said : " We ' re very pleased . We ' re very busy . " The airline flies a wide range of cargo from both Europe and Dubai to its African hub at Entebbe , where it has its own bonded warehouse and can turn around its DC - 10 freighter in one hour , he added . DAS has recently acquired a second DC - 10 which will be converted into a freighter by Italy ' s Alenia and is due to enter service late 1997 , he added . DAS has been moving around 100 tonnes of cobalt a week from Zambia to Rotterdam and Antwerp on its DC - 10F and two Boeing 707 freighters , and expects to be carrying 70 - odd tonnes weekly until end - May , he said . It has also been bringing in relief supplies from the UK and Dubai . One flight carried 16 four - wheel drive vehicles from the Gulf state , which had been shipped there by sea from Japan . Average ex - UK air cargo rates to Nairobi are marginally easier at 0 . 93 stg per kg / 100kg compared to 0 . 95 stg previously , with Harare at 1 . 43 stg against 1 . 45 stg and Entebbe steady at one pound a kg . Kigali is quoted at an indicative 1 . 45 per kg ex - UK for 100 kg or around 1 . 25 per kg for one tonne plus . The refugee situation in Zaire has countered the impact of the seasonal decline in flower exports from east and southern Africa , with space bookings ex - UK for relief aid firming . Affretair ' s Thomsett said his carrier ' s present schedule of three weekly UK - Africa freighter flights ( two with DC - 8Fs , one DC - 10F ) is likely to be kept at least until July as the result of relief aid demand . Cargo carriers report increasing enquiries for cargo capacity to Kisangani in Zaire with Bujumbura being used as an alternative , often fed from Entebbe where a number of Russian - built cargo aircraft are now based . " We have just received an enquiry to carry 124 tonnes of aid - - vehicles , medical equipment , high protein foods and such - - from Dar - es - Salaam to Bujumbura , " said Thompsett . Bernard Keay , director of London - based African International Airways said that since last autumn ' s start of the East African flower season his airline has been flying weekly Nairobi - London charters on an ACMI ( aircraft , crew , maintenance and insurance ) basis for British Airways . One of AIA ' s three Swaziland - registered 43 . 5 - tonne capacity DC - 8 - 54Fs has been used and , as the flower season comes to an end , Keay said he is negotiating a new six - month flying contract for an unnamed customer to operate UK - southern Africa charters from May 1 . He added the four key airfreight hubs in Africa , which supported sufficient inbound and outbound cargo demand , were Zimbabwe , Kenya , Uganda and South Africa . - Reuters Air Cargo Service Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax + 5017

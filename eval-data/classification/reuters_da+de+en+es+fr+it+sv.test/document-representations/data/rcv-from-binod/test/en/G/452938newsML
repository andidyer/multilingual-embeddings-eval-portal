Ramos says N . Korean defector in Philppines for short time . President Fidel Ramos said on Wednesday the Philippines had agreed to provide temporary haven to top North Korean defector Hwang Jang - yop but stressed his stay would be " as short as possible " . Ramos , speaking at a news conference , broke official silence over Hwang ' s presence in the Philippines but refused to shed light on the mystery of his whereabouts . " The security of our visitor is of paramount importance , " Ramos said . A special presidential task force has kept Hwang in a secret hideaway since he arrived on Tuesday , officials said , amid fears the 73 - year - old chief North Korean ideologue could be a target of Pyongyang assassins . " After consultations with concerned countries , the Philippines decided to allow the temporary stay of Mr Hwang only for as long as necessary and as short as possible , " said Ramos , reading from a prepared statement . Hwang arrived at nearby Clark air base on Tuesday from China , where he had been marooned in South Korea ' s embassy in Beijing since seeking asylum there on February 12 . Ramos refused to say when Hwang would be flown to South Korea . Security sources earlier said Hwang ' s stay in the Philppines could last up to a week . Ramos said the decision to shelter Hwang " was based on our desire to be of help to our neighbours in their need for third country facilities and to ease tension in the Korean peninsula . " " ( This ) would ensure the continued peace and stability of the Asia - Pacific region , " Ramos added . Asked why the Philippines was chosen to shelter Hwang before he flies to Seoul , Ramos said in jest : " Maybe because we are hospitable , may be because we are peaceful and maybe because we are more attractive , but that is just a guess . " Foreign undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said Manila would still have to negotiate with Seoul how long Hwang would stay in the Philippines . He said Hwang already had a South Korean passport . Security has been tightened at Clark , 80 km ( 50 miles ) north of Manila , amid reports Hwang might fly out sooner than expected . Guards turned away reporters who tried to get into the airport , saying they were on a security rehearsal . North Korea has a history of deadly attacks against its arch - rival South Korea . The two Koreas are still frozen in Cold War confrontation . Just three days after Hwang sought asylum in Beijing , a prominent North Korean defector was fatally shot near Seoul . The victim , Li Il - nam , was a nephew of the former wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il . Ramos ' s refusal to give the slightest hint on where Hwang was being kept deepened the mystery over the whereabouts of the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state , and spurred a flurry of rumours . Military officers said on Tuesday that military helicopters flew Hwang and his party to the northern mountain city of Baguio after the group flew into the former U . S . Clark airbase . But Baguio officials said they were unaware of his presence . Another officer said Hwang was flown to Manila . Checks on the presidential summer house , hotels , a South Korean church , a resort facility and places where South Koreans normally gather in Baguio failed to yield any trace of Hwang . A defence department officer said he believed Hwang was being kept at the armed forces intelligence compound in Manila ' s Camp Aguinaldo but this could not be verified . The officer said military intelligence chief Major - General Benjamin Libarnes was directing the operation and reporting directly to Ramos .

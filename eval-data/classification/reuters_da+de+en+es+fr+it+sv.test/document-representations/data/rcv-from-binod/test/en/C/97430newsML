Book Fair gets first with Internet rights deals . The Frankfurt Book Fair ' s Internet Rights Auction , a world first , has set a framework for writers and publishers to benefit from the publication of their works on the World Wide Web , publishers said on Friday . They said bestselling Irish novelist Maeve Binchy was close to a final deal to sell Internet publishing rights of one of her titles as a result of the auction . " This is the first step toward a new medium of publishing and to a commercialisation of publishing on the Internet , " said Laura Fillmore , president of U . S . publisher Open Book Systems , which organised the auction jointly with the Book Fair . The auction , a test case for the industry , offered Internet rights to Binchy ' s popular novel Circle of Friends , chosen partly to mark the Book Fair ' s Irish theme , and to U . S . Internet expert Gregory Rawlins ' Moths to the Flame : Seductions of Computer Technology . Until now , while texts of books have appeared on the Internet , there have been very few licensing agreements and no established procedure on how writers should be reimbursed for Internet use of their material . On Friday , Rawlins ' publisher , Boston - based MIT Press , said it had provisionally accepted a bid from newly - formed German joint venture , QBIS - Apple Tree , while Binchy is considering two rival offers from unnamed companies . Binchy , in Frankfurt for the Fair , said in a telephone interview she was confident that releasing her work on the Internet would not hurt her book sales , as is often warned . " People said this about radio , then about television , then films and then videos but we have the most buoyant book market ever . This ( book ) world is not like a cake which gets smaller when you cut a slice . . . it ' s more like a pile of stones that grows when you add a new one to it , " Binchy said . Bids for the rights were registered anonymously at a special Internet site and broadcast during the Book Fair , the biggest of its kind , which runs October 2 - 7 . Details were sketchy on the sums involved in the successful bids , with organisers referring to a four figure U . S . dollar sum , but saying final details needed to be worked out . It was also unclear how many bidders were involved , but Fillmore said the Internet auction site had received 15 , 000 hits , or instances of access by interested parties , most of whom were established electronic publishers . All participants rejected the idea that Internet access could damage the book market . " Nobody wants to take a computer with them to bed or onto the beach . What this means is bringing a whole new group of people to read your work , " said Binchy ' s agent Christine Green . Green said Binchy would in any case most likely plump for a proposal to release extracts of her novel in several different languages over the Internet for educational purposes rather than a full - text option . Officials at QBIS - Apple Tree , formed hastily at the Book Fair in response to the auction opportunity , said they were working on ways to restrict access to their Internet site , creating a model that might be extended to more printed works . However Thomas McCorkle , marketing manager for Rawlins ' publisher MIT , said the form the final Internet publication would take was not his priority . " For us this is more a question of how we will be reimbursed , " he said .

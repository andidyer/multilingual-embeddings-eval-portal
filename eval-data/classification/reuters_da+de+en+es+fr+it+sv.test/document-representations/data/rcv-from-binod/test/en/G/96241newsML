Russian officials differ on army problems . Russia ' s new Defence Council met on Friday to tackle a crisis of confidence in the armed forces but the country ' s most prominent soldier snubbed the meeting and it ended with serious differences of opinion . Interfax news agency said the military argued that a shortage of cash was undermining Russia ' s defence capabilities , while the government said the army was too big , with too many generals and too much bureaucracy . " Participants reached the conclusion that serious reorganisation of the armed forces was needed which would take into consideration both the military and political state of the country and real economic conditions , " Interfax said . Security chief Alexander Lebed , who rang alarm bells last month with a public warning that soldiers could mutiny if their wages were not paid , did not attend the meeting in a clear sign of dissatisfaction with his limited role in the new Council . A spokesman said he was busy working on documents relating to a peace deal with breakaway Chechnya . President Boris Yeltsin set up the council in July as a counterbalance to the Security Council of which Lebed is the secretaryFriday ' s closed - door meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , a potential rival of Lebed for the presidency should Yeltsin be unable to continue in office . The 65 - year - old president , facing open heart surgery in the next two months , on Thursday ordered the government to resolve cash problems in the army , where many soldiers have not been paid for months . " I am taking this issue under special control , " Yeltsin said in a radio address from the Central Clinical Hospital . " Russia must have a modern and professional army . Serving in it must be a source of respect and prestige . Both for the man in the ranks and to the officer . We will achieve this . " Yeltsin has been delegating more and more power to Chernomyrdin as he prepares for an operation to improve the blood supply to his heart . The prime minister was representing Russia at a summit of leaders of former Soviet states in the Kazakh capital Almaty later on Friday . The talks were called to discuss Afghanistan . The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 , but pulled out after a bloody nine - year war . Moscow regards the southern flank of the former Soviet Union as its strategic underbelly and Russian border guards patrol Tajikistan ' s 1 , 500 - km ( 900 - mile ) frontier with Afghanistan . Much of Afghanistan is now under the control of the Islamic Taleban militia , although ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum holds several provinces in the north of the country . Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev , speaking before the summit , said on Friday that countries should not meddle in Afghanistan ' s internal affairs . Lebed , who has warned that failure to act in Afghanistan could have serious implications for national security , is also fiercely opposed to the expansion of the Western NATO alliance . But he leaves for Brussels this weekend to meet top NATO officials . It will be the first time the bass - voiced security chief has travelled to the West - - he has said in the past that he knew too many military secrets to be allowed to travel . Lebed ' s main achievement since Yeltsin brought him into his administration between the two rounds of the Russian presidential election has been a peace deal with separatist rebels in the southern region of Chechnya . Separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev met Chernomyrdin on Thursday and they agreed to set up a new joint body to rebuild Chechnya ' s war - torn economy and organise local elections there . Fighting has stopped in the Caucasus region following the peace deal , but eight people were killed and 24 injured there when a military helicopter crashed late on Thursday . A group of separatist fighters helped take the wounded to hospital .

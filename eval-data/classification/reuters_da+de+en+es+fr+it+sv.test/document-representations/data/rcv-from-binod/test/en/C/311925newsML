Frontier Airlines claims United Airlines unfair . Low - cost carrier Frontier Airlines Thursday launched an attack on giant rival United Airlines , claiming the Chicago - based carrier was engaging in predatory practices to drive smaller carriers out of business . Chicago - based United Airlines , a subsidiary of UAL Corp . , dismissed the claims , calling them " groundless " and " ludicrous " . Frontier President Sam Addoms told a press briefing that Frontier will meet next week with officials from the Justice Department and the Department of Transportation in a bid to plead its case . Addoms said United , which has 70 percent of the Denver market , or 77 percent including traffic from its United Express affiliates , is sending a strong message that it will no longer tolerate low - priced competition here . Frontier began service in July 1994 and operates a fleet of 10 Boeing 737 jets on routes linking its Denver hub to 14 cities in 11 states ; 12 of these routes are also served by United . Calling United a " 100 pound gorilla , " Addoms said evidence it has gathered shows fares have risen in cities that Frontier has been driven out of . For instance , charts that Frontier had at the briefing showed average airfares from Denver to Billings , Montana , at $ 168 before Frontier started service , dropping to $ 92 when Frontier did serve the city and then rose to $ 208 after Frontier left . Addoms said Frontier was going public with its complaint in hopes of stirring consumer interest . Addoms said the " public may choose to join us in either of two ways - - they may chose to inform Congress . They also may chose to buy non - United carrier products . . . as their means of sending a clear economic message as to how they feel about the matter . "

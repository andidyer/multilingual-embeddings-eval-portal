Filipino in UAE jail seeks help from victim ' s kin . A Filipino man , in jail in the United Arab Emirates for the past seven years for killing an Indian national , has written to the victim ' s family seeking clemency , the Philippines ambassador Roy Seneres said on Sunday . The ambassador , who was also sending a letter to the family of Harbajan Singh in Britain seeking a meeting with them , said he wanted to convince them to spare the life of John Aquino , 37 . A UAE supreme court had in December overturned a lower court ruling in 1989 sentencing Aquino to death . Under Islamic sharia law applied in the UAE , the family of the victim could ask for the death penalty in a murder case , if the suspect is convicted , or could agree to a jail term and accept financial recompense , known as blood money . Seneres said he did not know when he might go to Britain . " I do not have any definite plan yet . I will not go before I have information his ( the victim ' s ) family is ready to see me " . " We will be mailing a letter to his ( the victim ' s ) family shortly asking for an appointment and hoping for their understanding . . . , " the ambassador told Reuters . " And to it , I will attach a letter from John , written in Filipino - - accompanied with an English translation - - in which he says he is remorseful and seeks their forgiveness , " he added . Previous efforts to seek mercy from Singh ' s family have failed . The UAE ' s supreme court , at the defence ' s request , on Saturday agreed to postpone to June 7 the hearing in Aquino ' s case to give it time to contact Singh ' s family , Seneres said . The court in December overturned a lower court ruling sentencing him to death for killing Singh and the attempted murder of another Indian man during an argument . It said it would retry him . The Federal Supreme Court makes the final ruling on death sentences , but any execution must be approved by UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al - Nahayan . The UAE came under international criticism in 1995 when a court sentenced Filipina Sarah Balabagan to death for stabbing her 70 - year - old employer to death . She said he had tried to rape her . Sheikh Zaid intervened and persuaded the victim ' s family to drop the death sentence in exchange for a financial settlement .

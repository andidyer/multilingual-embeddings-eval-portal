YEAR - HK economy bounding ahead with handover . Hong Kong is experiencing something of an economic renaissance just as its colonial masters prepare to depart after more than 150 years of rule . Soaring stock and property prices on the eve of Hong Kong ' s mid - 1997 return to China indicate rising confidence about the coming year and beyond , with little expected to disrupt the optimism in the short - term , economists said . " The 1997 handover , that has been totally discounted , " said George Leung , chief economist at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp . " We ' re now so close to the 1997 handover , and a number of important issues are clear to public . How China will rule Hong Kong , I admit there are still uncertainties , but the picture is much clearer . It was not possible to plan a few years ago , but now it is , " he said . Although economic growth rates and export performance failed to meet expectations in 1996 , Hong Kong ' s two bellwether confidence indicators rocketed later in the year , supported by improving economic fundamentals and a charm campaign by China . Hong Kong ' s blue chip index , the Hang Seng , added an impressive 30 percent in 1996 as international money poured in , removing some of Hong Kong ' s long - held political discount in response to new expectations of a smooth transition and increased exposure to a stronger Chinese economy . At the same time , property prices in Hong Kong suddenly spiked in October after gaining momentum throughout the summer , prompting government hints of intervention in December to cool rampant speculation . Other economic indicators told the same story . Inflation and unemployment fell in 1996 while interest rates remained steady and private consumption improved . This positive performance countered weaker exports and surprisingly soft growth , both of which are expected to recover in 1997 . " We already see signs of a tentative recovery in place and we are expecting it to take hold over the course of next year , " said Arup Raha , deputy chief economist at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong . Hong Kong ' s economy is expected to expand 4 . 7 percent in 1996 against earlier estimates of five percent , with improvements to 5 . 5 percent forecast next year . The government also revised its annual inflation forecast downwards to 6 . 0 percent from earlier estimates of 6 . 8 percent , and few expect to see any significant change in price pressures over the next year . " Once the economy really recovers steam it would have an effect on inflation , but given that inflation lags real activity it may take some time before inflation picks up , " Raha said . Many economists said the two most prominent features of Hong Kong ' s performance in 1996 were a volatile external sector and a latter - year recovery in private consumption . In marked contrast to the export - driven turnarounds of the past , private consumption is expected to lead Hong Kong ' s recovery this year , underscoring Hong Kong ' s new guise as an increasingly developed economy , economists said . " This is not like 1994 or earlier years , " said Leung . " This is quite different . " Private consumption accounts for a rising 60 percent of gross domestic product in Hong Kong . While exports remain valued at more than 300 percent of GDP , their composition and relative performances are shifting to reflect Hong Kong ' s absorption into the broader economy of Southern China . The government said Hong Kong exports grew five percent in the first nine months , considerably slower than the 12 percent increase recorded in 1995 . Within that total , re - exports - - goods shipped from other regions through Hong Kong to consuming nations - fell by seven percent against a 14 - percent rise in 1995 . A number of reasons were cited for the weakness , including an inventory correction in the United States that hammered electronics exports across the region . A strong U . S . dollar , weak import demand in the United States and China , tension across the Taiwan Strait early in the year and the China - U . S . dispute over protection of intellectual property rights also hurt Hong Kong exports in 1996 . Lehman ' s Raha said a number of factors will support Hong Kong ' s economy throughout 1997 . Recovery in member states of the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development will improve external demand , and so will credit easing in China and its newly - convertible current account which took effect in December . " With the soft - landing in the past few months , and also the reduction of tariffs there is more import demand in China and that will benefit Hong Kong trade , " Leung said . " There will be greater exports as well . No matter which direction it goes , Hong Kong as a re - export centre will benefit . " Although future direction of the U . S . dollar is difficult , if not impossible , to predict , many do not expect to see a repeat of this year ' s 40 - percent gain against the Japanese yen . The stronger greenback in 1996 hurt exports around Asia in 1996 , particularly in states that link their currencies to the U . S . , such as Hong Kong . At the same time , domestic factors will continue to stimulate that elusive " feel - good factor " necessary for a sustained recovery . " Everything is pointing positive , " Raha said . - - Hong Kong Newsroom ( 852 ) 2843 6441

Hurricane Marco nears Jamaica , downgraded to storm . Jamaica braced for a battering on Wednesday but Hurricane Marco weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm as it crept near the Caribbean island . The Jamaican government replaced its hurricane warning with a tropical storm warning ; hurricane watches for Haiti and eastern Cuba were similarly downgraded . " It ' s looking a little ragged , " Mike Hopkins , a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Centre in Miami , said . Torrential rains of up to 15 inches ( 45 cms ) were still expected to drive in alongside the storm , the centre said in an advisory . Marco has barely moved over the last few hours . At 4 p . m . EST ( 2100 GMT ) , Marco ' s centre was 215 miles ( 345 km ) south of Kingston , Jamaica , at latitude 14 . 9 north and longitude 77 . 4 west . It was expected to trek northeastward at about 6 mph ( 10 kph ) to 9 mph ( 14 kph ) during the next 24 hours , bringing it near to Jamaica and then close to Cuba over the next 36 hours . Maximum sustained winds decreased to near 70 mph ( 112 kph ) and were expected to weaken further , the centre said . They were extending up to 140 miles ( 220 km ) from the eye of the storm . The Jamaican government had warned residents to prepare for rough weather as Marco headed toward the island dumping torrential rain in its path . The Jamaica Office of Disaster Preparedness said the island had already been lashed by heavy rains since Oct . 23 , causing $ 3 million in damages to roads and drainage systems . About 170 families were without shelter because of flooding . Disaster committees were on full alert , urging people to stock up on batteries and canned food . But there had been no rain in Kingston by midday on Wednesday and there was no sense of panic , residents said . Honduras and the Dominican Republic were also drenched by heavy rains , not related to Marco , which left thousands of people homeless . Dominican authorities said four hydroelectric dams had filled up and rivers flooded with the overspill . Wide areas were under water including farmlands , Civil Defence Director Eugenio Cabral said . More than 7 , 000 people were driven from their homes by rains in Honduras and one person was killed on Tuesday , local radio stations said . The National Hurricane Centre said downpours would hit Central America over the next day or two , causing flash floods and mudslides . On Tuesday , Nicaraguan civil defence authorities blamed at least two deaths on Marco after flooding washed away homes in the Pacific coast and northern regions . A tropical storm graduates to hurricane status when maximum winds exceed 74 mph ( 119 kph ) . This year ' s Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on Nov . 30 .

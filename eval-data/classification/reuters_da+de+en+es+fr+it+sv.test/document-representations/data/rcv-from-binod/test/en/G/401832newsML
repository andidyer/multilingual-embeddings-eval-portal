Exile office in London irritant in ties with Egypt . Egyptian Islamists in exile have added a new irritant to relations between Egypt and Britain by opening a " political media organisation " in London to launch a propaganda war against the Egyptian government . The International Office for the Defence of the Egyptian People said in a founding statement its mission would be to expose what it called " the regime ' s aggression against the Egyptian people ' s beliefs , dignity , freedom and prosperity " . A senior Egyptian official cited the office this week as another example of European leniency towards the Islamist exiles whom the government blames for political violence at home . Egypt believes the exiles are the masterminds and financiers behind a long campaign of violence led by the Gama ' a al - Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) , the largest organisation fighting to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak and set up a strict Islamic state . The general secretary of the new office is Adel Abd al - Maguid , a lawyer who left Egypt in the early 1990s after defending Islamist militants in the Egyptian courts . In a telephone interview on Tuesday , Abd al - Maguid told Reuters the finance for his office came from a network of members , mainly businessmen in Europe , Egypt and Arab countries . " It ' s completely independent of any political parties . What matters to us is the state of human rights in Egypt , " he added . Egyptian officials and the British embassy in Cairo on Tuesday played down the effect the office would have on relations , which went through a rocky patch last year when Islamists tried to hold an international conference in London . The Islamists called off the gathering due to escalating security costs . " We have received no official protest ( about the office ) and contacts between security organisations in the two countries continue and are in good shape , " an embassy source said . A senior Egyptian official dismissed Abd al - Maguid as an armchair propagandist and said he did not want to honour him by commenting on the opening of his office . " This is an individual whose background is well - known . What do you expect from such people ? They are fugitives on the run from one place to another , " he added . " The British are fully aware of our point of view - - that sheltering these people hurts the host country more than anyone else , " said the official , who asked not to be named . He linked Abd al - Maguid with Islamist militant leader Ayman el - Zawahri , who Egypt believes has won political asylum in Switzerland . The Swiss government says it has no trace of him . The dispute over the political activities of the exiles in London goes back years and is complicated by misunderstandings about the legal status of their organisations . The Arabic - language press and some Interior Ministry officials , based on their own experience , assume that offices such as Abd al - Maguid ' s need government approval to operate . Abd al - Maguid told Reuters that opening his office did require bureaucratic procedures but he declined to give details . The office is trying to register as a charity , he added . Asked what would be the effect of proposed British legislation on incitement by exile groups , he said his office would be safe because it would not advocate " terrorism " or violence against the Egyptian government . Opponents of the new law say the aim is to clamp down on exiles like Saudi dissident Mohammed al - Masari , whom the British tried to deport to Dominica to placate the Saudi rulers . One Cairo diplomat said he doubted the issue would end in a big row . " It won ' t be a repeat of the conference affair . Egyptian - British security relations are good , " he added .

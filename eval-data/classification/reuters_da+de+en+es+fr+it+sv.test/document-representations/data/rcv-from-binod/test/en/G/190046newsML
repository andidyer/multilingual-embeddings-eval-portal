Bosnia peace stabilisation plan backed , U . S . warns . Bosnia ' s three co - presidents agreed with world powers on Thursday on a detailed plan to stabilise the fragile peace in the former Yugoslav republic over the next two years as a condition for continuing international aid . But Western powers differed publicly at a Paris conference over the duration of an extended mandate for NATO - led peacekeepers , and the United States warned Bosnia ' s factions they could face U . N . sanctions if they fail to restore freedom of movement in the ethnically divided country . The accord approved at the three - hour meeting provides a transitional period to make the peace negotiated one year ago in Dayton , Ohio , self - sustaining and build joint institutions , a functioning economy and a more normal life for Bosnians . French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette , who co - chaired the conference , said it had adopted " a contract between the leaders of Bosnia - Herzegovina and the international community " in which world aid was conditional on compliance . " We will respect this contract strictly . . . but it is first and foremost the leaders of Bosnia - Herzegovina who must fully accept their responsiblity , " he told a news conference . The co - presidents - - Moslem Alija Izetbegovic , Serb Momcilo Krajisnik and Croat Kresimir Zubak - - pledged to complete Bosnia ' s joint institutions " as soon as possible " and accepted a 13 - point plan to complete implementation of the Dayton accord . It commits them to allow freedom of movement , facilitate the return of refugees , cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal and increase democracy and press freedom . Without committing the international community to keep a military presence when the mandate of the Peace Implementation Force ( IFOR ) expires next month , the document said : " Recognising the fundamental importance of a secure environment to the task of civilian implementation , the participants welcomed the ongoing study by NATO members in cooperation with other states participating in IFOR of options dealing with the evolving situation . " International mediator Carl Bildt , whose powers were increased by the conference , said the peace process was " not yet self - sustaining " and a successor force must stay for the entire two - year consolidation period . However , German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Bonn insisted it be limited to one year . It would be wrong to give the rival Bosnian factions the impression that international aid could be dragged out over several years , he said . " Our position is crystal clear . One year , " Kinkel said . U . S . Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the meeting : " We have made it clear to the parties that the Security Council will consider imposing measures if they fail to significantly meet their obligations under the peace agreement . " He said the Bosnians would be under close scrutiny regarding freedom of movement and the return of refugees . Aid would also depend on their handing over suspects to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague . De Charette told the meeting that the Bosnians must set up a government before a second conference due in London next month . Senior U . S . official John Kornblum held late - night talks to press the three leaders into agreeing a joint cabinet list , but Bosnian officials said little progress was made . Bosnian state radio said Izetbegovic had resented the sharp U . S . pressure . British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind summed up the message to Bosnia ' s leaders when he told reporters : " The international effort should not be taken for granted . They must not assume that we will be there whatever they do . " It must be dependent on the Bosnian parties showing their willingness to take forward the process of nation building . There ' s been some progress but not enough , " he said . Christopher told the Bosnian co - presidents on the eve of the talks that the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement was at a " very critical stage " after a clash on Tuesday in which two Moslem refugees were killed .

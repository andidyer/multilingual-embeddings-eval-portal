Lenzing raises fibre prices by five pct . Austrian fibre maker Lenzing AG said on Thursday it had raised its fibre prices by five percent at the start of the year in response to increased demand after stockpiles had emptied over the past year . " Lenzing takes the opportunity of this pick - up in demand to raise the price level , which has been low for months , and increases prices by five percent , " the company said in a statement . Lenzing added fibre prices in Europe had reached their lowest level since the start of the 1980s , after producers cut prices in response to a slump in demand particularly over the past year .

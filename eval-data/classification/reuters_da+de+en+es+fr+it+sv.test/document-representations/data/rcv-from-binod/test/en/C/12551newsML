GM German unit sets up China office . Adam Opel AG , the German subsidiary of U . S . giant General Motors , has set up an office in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou , the China Daily newspaper said on Saturday . Opel was trying to take advantage of the undeveloped automobile industry in Guangzhou and would focus on seeking opportunities to produce vehicles and components in the booming south , the newspaper quoted company officials as saying . Pressure was mounting on French car maker PSA Peugot Citroen Group ' s joint venture in the city , where car output had lagged far behind China ' s other main cities , it said . " People are playing close attention to Guangzhou to see who will succeed in persuading Peugot to give up its interest in the venture , " it said . The Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Co , which went into production in 1986 , was able to produce and sell only several thousand cars a year , it said . The China Daily said Guangzhou ' s car industry had also been criticised for over - use of foreign components and for designs that were outdated in comparison with those made in Beijing , Shanghai and northern Tianjin city . But Opel and other foreign car makers were planning to revitalise the industry and turn the city into an automobile manufacturing centre , it said . China has one of the lowest vehicle density rates in the world , roughly one car per 700 people , and the car population is forecast to double to 20 million by the year 2000 .

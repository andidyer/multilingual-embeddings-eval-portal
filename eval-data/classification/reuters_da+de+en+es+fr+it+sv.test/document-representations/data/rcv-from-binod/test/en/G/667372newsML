FEATURE - India - born guitarist boosted by Jerry Garcia ' s spirit . It was pure chance that led Indian - born guitarist Sanjay Mishra to cross paths with Jerry Garcia one day in December 1994 , but the fruits of that unlikely pairing can now be heard in a bewitching , and in some ways historic , album . Mishra ' s " Blue Incantation , " released by Rykodisc in April , features some of the final recordings by Garcia , the legendary Grateful Dead guitarist who died at 53 in 1995 . The unassuming Mishra , 42 , who only last year quit his day job in Washington , is grateful the Garcia connection has sparked interest in his unique blend of Indian and Western music . " It certainly got my music heard by a lot of people who perhaps may not have bought it ( otherwise ) , and hopefully they discovered something else . . . " Mishra told Reuters . Built around a MIDI classical guitar , Mishra ' s music combines traditional guitar and orchestral sonorities , ambient drones and vocal lines from classical Indian music looped on a sampler , all triggered by the guitar and spiced with additional Indian instruments . Garcia appears on three of the album ' s 10 tracks , his liquid electric guitar lines adding a poignant , ghostly shimmer . Mishra said it was almost is if Garcia knew his days were numbered as he poured his heart into this haunting music that might ultimately stand as his most fitting epitaph . ' A CERTAIN GOODBYE QUALITY ' " Especially ( the song ) ' Clouds , ' there ' s a certain goodbye quality to that piece , " he said . " There ' s a lot of pain and sadness in his playing , an otherworldliness about it . " Garcia instinctively nailed his contribution to the 7 - 1 / 2 - minute " Clouds " in the first take , and Mishra said this elegiac , goosebump - inducing song is his personal favourite . Mishra , who lives in Arlington , Virginia , came to the United States in 1977 to study at the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore . He was granted U . S . citizenship on the grounds of " exceptional ability in the arts . " Born in the state of Madhyapradesh in northern India , he grew up in Calcutta . A rebel of sorts , he became transfixed by the Beatles and rock ' n ' roll when he saw the film " A Hard Day ' s Night " when he was about 12 . " In India in those days it was very hard to find a guitar , " he said . " The kind of guitar that was popular was a pedal steel guitar , like a Hawaiian guitar . " The young Mishra fell in love with the guitar for the same reason a Westerner like George Harrison became enchanted with the Indian sitar , he said . " Being from India , the guitar had all the exotic elements for me . Any Indian instruments that I ' d been taking lessons on before that seemed boring . " Over the years , he has drawn inspiration from guitarists as diverse as Garcia , Jimi Hendrix , Julian Bream and Joe Pass . Mishra released his first album , " The Crossing , " on his tiny Akar Music label in 1993 . The following year , while working as public affairs director at Greenpeace in Washington , D . C . , Mishra received a phone call from a woman filmmaker who was researching environmental issues . When she stopped in at the Greenpeace office later in the day , she also introduced her husband , " Jerry . " Mishra was amazed to see that it was Jerry Garcia . BIG FAN OF JERRY GARCIA " I ' d been a big fan of his way back in India , " he said . " So I gave him a copy of my old album , with the caveat that it was a very small project , and nothing , really . " Instead of throwing the album away , Garcia actually played it in his car that day . Mishra was stunned when Garcia phoned up the next day and offered to collaborate . " He was such a warm person and just made me feel comfortable . He was very positive . . . very genuine . " The low - key Mishra had not given much thought to marketing himself , but Garcia , who was not exactly a corporate type , pushed him to be more aggressive about material matters . " He said , ' Marketing ' s a big thing , and obviously you haven ' t marketed it . . . You ' re thinking too small . ' " It was a dream come true when Garcia offered to record with Mishra in his San Francisco studio and foot the bill . Mishra last saw Garcia two months before his death , but their bond continued beyond the grave . In April 1996 , Mishra accompanied Garcia ' s widow Deborah and friend Bob Weir ( Grateful Dead guitarist ) to India , where they secretly scattered Garcia ' s ashes in the Ganges River . The restless Garcia had always wanted to visit India , Mishra said . " I had invited Jerry to India with me back in June . . . So he went , just in a different form . " Unfortunately , the ashes episode caused a flap when some of Garcia ' s relatives found out and objected . But Mishra said the India trip was a magical experience . " This is a person whose music I played in India over the years , and then to be standing there in the Ganges with his ashes , I sort of had to think that this had to be some sort of higher power that did this . " Looking ahead , Mishra said his recent decision to quit his job should free him up for more concerts and touring . His musical score for French director Eric Heumann ' s award - winning film " Port Djema , " released in April by Polygram , has won critical acclaim . Mishra is working on a new album that he hopes to release in the autumn . He will also reissue his 1993 album , which first caught Garcia ' s ear , in a superior , remixed form .

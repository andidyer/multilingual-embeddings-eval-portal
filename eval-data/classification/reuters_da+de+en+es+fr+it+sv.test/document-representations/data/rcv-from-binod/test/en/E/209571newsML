Bosnian Serbs hard hit by economic aid squeeze . Bosnia ' s Serb republic has lost out to the country ' s Moslem - Croat Federation in the post - war aid sweepstakes and suffers from zero growth , low wages and high inflation as a result , the World Bank said on Friday . The World Bank mission director in Bosnia Rory O ' Sullivan said in Sarajevo the international community ' s goal of spending about $ 900 million in reconstruction aid in 1996 was on track . He said 98 per cent of those funds had been allocated to Bosnia ' s Moslem - Croat Federation . " There are many reasons for that . One is the U . N . sanctions which existed against Srpska ( the Serb republic ) right at the beginning ( of the year ) , " O ' Sullivan explained . " Subsequently there was a problem moving around in Srpska in March or April so many of the donors started up designing their operations much later in Srpska than in the Federation . " Bosnia ' s 43 - month war ended with the initialling of the Dayton peace agreement a year ago this week . International mediators who brokered the deal promised billions of dollars in reconstruction assistance to the country ' s two post - war entities , so long as they fulfilled the terms imposed upon them by the peace accord . But both the Federation and the Republic have fallen far short of their Dayton obligations , the mediators say . Observers argue that Bosnian Serb political leaders have been the worst offenders by blocking refugee returns and freedom of movement and failing to surrender war criminals . The Bosnian Serb people have paid a heavy price for their leaders ' dedication to the politics of ethnic partition . " If funds are not invested people suffer . . . . The situation in Republika Srpska compared with the Federation is very dramatic in economic terms , " O ' Sullivan said . He reported a Federation growth rate of 35 - 50 percent compared to zero or negative growth in the Serb Republic . Wage rates in the Federation are three times higher than in the Serb entity . And while inflation in the Federation hovers around zero it is somewhere between 35 and 65 per cent in the Serb Republic . O ' Sullivan said the human cost of this investment pattern was of great concern to the international donor community . " What is perfectly clear is lack of investment . . . is causing immense hardship and anguish for the people of Srpska and I think that the donor community will take that into account , " O ' Sullivan said of prospective funding decisions . " Many of the donors are now trying to introduce programmes to catch up the level of investment ( in Srpska ) . " The donor community is divided on the issue of political conditionality . Some nations reckon witholding funds pressures governments to change their behaviour while others insist that it mostly punishes innocent civilians . For the moment the World Bank is awarding no new grants or loans to either entity in Bosnia because the country ' s leaders have failed to form the joint institutions Dayton called for .

Scientists confident of life on Jupiter moon . Space scientists said on Wednesday they were confident life existed in the muddy waters of one of Jupiter ' s moons . " I am sure there ' s life there , " John Delaney of the University of Washington said in a reference to the Jovian moon Europa . Delaney and the other experts spoke at a news briefing detailing results of pictures from the Galileo probe . Pictures of Europa sent back by Galileo after its closest flyby of the moon in February and released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Wednesday showed a red - coloured sea with a crust of ice about three feet ( one metre ) thick in which huge icebergs several miles ( km ) across were floating , the scientists said . The images were taken as Galileo was 363 miles ( 586 km ) from Europa . Talking to reporters at NASA ' s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , the scientists said they believed all the ingredients for creating and sustaining life forms existed in Europa ' s waters . Delaney , a professor of oceanology , said he and other scientists believed the waters under the ice crust were being warmed by volcanic activity and undersea research on Earth had shown that " volcanic activity supports life without sunlight . " Richard Terrile of the JPL , a planetary scientist , said he believed there was organic matter in sediment at the bottom of Europa ' s ocean and pointed out : " On Earth , these same ingredients in a million years gave presence to life . " Terrile said he would like to see a " machine exploration " of Europa during a future unmanned probe to the moon in the hope of confirming his beliefs . Delaney said he was " very excited " by Galileo ' s pictures . " The bottom line is , it ' s about life . The discovery of life on another planet will surpass anything that has ever taken place in human history , " he said . He added that volcanic activity not only sustained life but encouraged it , saying when a volcano erupted under the ocean on Earth it caused bacteria to " bloom at a massive level . " In an effort to bolster their life - in - outer - space theory , scientists and engineers from around the world were meeting in Pasadena on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss an exploration of Lake Vostok , a subglacial lake under the ice in Antarctica which they believe has conditions similar to Europa ' s sea . Michael Carr of the United States Geological Survey said there was evidence of movement and rotation by the icebergs which could not be explained by wind as Europa is in a vacuum . " The plausible cause for this motion is traction below which implies liquid below . Dr Paul Geissler of the University of Arizona said the pictures showed the sea as a red - brown area on the surface of Europa . He speculated that the red - brown material in the waters indicated it was a " muddy sea , " while Max Coon , a scientist with NorthWest Research Associates , Inc . , concluded after studying the pictures that , " The ice features here ( on Earth ) look very , very like the ones on Europa . " Oceanographer Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute said he believed Europa was still developing and the ice crust was about one million years old , " a mere day in geological terms . " The scientists , who make up the Galileo imaging team and whose task it is to interpret the pictures and data sent back from the spacecraft , also said it appeared that the ice crust was slowly melting because of the warmer waters below which were being heated by volcanic activity . Galileo was launched by the shuttle Atlantis in October , 1989 and arrived at Jupiter to begin its exploration of the planet and its moons in December of 1995 .

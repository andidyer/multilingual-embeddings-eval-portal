MOTOR RACING - FINAL WORD ON ESTORIL RACE WITH TEAMS . Motor racing ' s ruling body hinted on Thursday that the 1997 Estoril Grand Prix might still be run , 24 hours after scrapping it . But Portuguese officials said such a move would need the backing of Formula One teams . The International Automobile Federation ( FIA ) had announced on Thursday it was switching the October 26 race to Jerez in neighbouring Spain because of doubts that needed repairs to the twisting circuit would be completed on time . But after receiving guarantees from the Portuguese government that the work would be done , it issued another statement on Friday saying it hoped a race could still be held in Portugal before the end of the year . " The FIA is confident that the Portuguese Grand Prix will be back on the FIA Formula One world championship calendar for 1998 and thereafter and hopeful that Formula One cars can run again at Estoril before the end of 1997 , " it said . However , Alfredo Cesar Torres , president of the Portuguese Automobile Club and a FIA vice - president , said Thursday ' s decision to switch the race to Spain still stood . The only way a race could be run at Estoril was if teams such as Williams , Ferrari and Benetton agreed to extend the season , raising the total number of races to 18 . " The decision on Jerez was final , " he said in a telephone interview . " To have a new grand prix ( at Estoril ) . . . the FIA has to ask the teams whether they accept an 18th race . " Confusion over the staging of the Portuguese Grand Prix surfaced on Thursday immediately after the initial FIA announcement when Portugal ' s Economy Minister Augusto Mateus said the race was merely being delayed . He said he had given written guarantees to the international race authorities that the needed work would be done by the end of August and in return FIA had offered to let the race be run on November 9 . But Torres said if the teams refused then Estoril would have to wait until 1998 before staging another grand prix . A decision could be taken at Barcelona where the next Formula One race is due to be held on May 25 , he said . The improvements included alterations to the paddock and various spectator facilities as well as enhanced run - off areas .

Euro - MPs demand stricter environment impact rules . European Union countries should be bound by much stricter environmental protection laws , the European Parliament said on Wednesday . The parliament ' s comments came in a report drafted by Belgian Green Paul Lannoye which demands substantial improvements to a new draft directive on environmental impact studies - - COM ( 93 ) 575 . The proposal is designed to tighten up a 1985 European Union law indicating the type of projects which cannot be carried out before a study has been done on their environmental impact . It extends the list of major developments where a study will be mandatory to include such things as dual carriageways , gas and oil pipelines , overhead power lines and chemical storage facilities . EU environment ministers reached a common position on the proposal in July but only after cutting out a series of elements proposed by the European Commission and by Euro - MPs , who gave the draft directive a first reading last October . Parliament said the scope of the draft directive was too narrow - - it still allows member states to approve all defence projects , and far too many intensive farming and electrification schemes , without first studying their impact on the environment . Euro - MPs also criticised the proposal for allowing far too many derogations and leaving it up to individual member states to decide what constitutes an environmentally sensitive area . Impact studies are compulsory in such sensitive areas . Council ' s rejection of the " zero option " - - the decision not to go ahead with a project at all if all the possible options prove to be environmentally unsound - - came in for attack too . Parliament demanded improvements to the draft directive on all these fronts , as well as guarantees that experts employed by the member states to carry out environmental impact studies will be entirely independent and suitably qualified . Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard told Euro - MPs on Tuesday night the Commission could accept amendments to bring large intensive livestock farms and golf courses into the scope of the directive . The proposal needs the support of both ministers and parliament to come into force .

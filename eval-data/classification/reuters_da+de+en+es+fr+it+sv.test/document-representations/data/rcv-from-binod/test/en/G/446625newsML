Yeltsin asks liberal Nemtsov be first deputy PM . President Boris Yeltsin offered a top cabinet job on Monday to an influential and liberal regional leader , Boris Nemtsov , sending another signal of his commitment to boosting Russia ' s stalled economic reforms . Yeltsin made the surprise offer to Nemtsov , the 37 - year - old elected governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region , to become one of two first deputy prime ministers at talks in the Kremlin . Yeltsin , who is working on a gradual reshuffle , had earlier transferred his reformist chief of staff Anatoly Chubais , 41 , to the cabinet with a pledge to make him the only first deputy to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . " There is a very interesting variant , " Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as telling Nemtsov . " Two young men - - you and Anatoly Chubais - - create a fresh young team in the government - - from scratch . No one ( else ) has been appointed yet . All candidates to the government would be agreed with the two first deputy premiers . " Interfax said Nemtsov had accepted the offer and would return to his home region on the Volga River to make a formal announcement . It said Nemtsov , seen as a potential presidential candidate in the year 2000 , would be responsible for the government ' s social programmes , handling natural monopolies and running uneasy relations with powerful regional authorities . Nemtsov was not available for comment and the Kremlin confirmed only that he had been offered the job . It did not immediately confirm the report that he had already agreed to take up the post . Yeltsin ' s offer to Chubais and Nemtsov to form the new government was a clear change from his earlier reshuffle plans . Last Friday Yeltsin announced that the new cabinet would have only one first deputy prime minister and seven vice - premiers , a lower rank . His remarks , made during a meeting with media chiefs , were widely seen as a sign of protracted bargaining between Chernomyrdin and Chubais over the extent of their control over the government . Yeltsin was due to meet Chernomyrdin and Chubais later on Tuesday to discuss the government reshuffle .

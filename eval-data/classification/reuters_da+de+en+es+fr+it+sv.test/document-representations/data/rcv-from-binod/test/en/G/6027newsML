Huge explosions rock Grozny after planes fly over . Huge explosions rocked the Chechen capital on Wednesday after warplanes flew over the city , in what appeared to be the start of large - scale Russian bombing raids . Reuter correspondent Lawrence Sheets , in Alkhan - Yurt a few km ( miles ) southwest of Grozny , said the latest explosions were so loud they could only have come from aerial bombs . Planes had been screaming over the city on and off since 11 a . m . ( 0700 GMT ) , but it had been difficult to tell if periodic blasts came from the air or from heavy artillery fire . The latest explosions sounded after a plane flew over at around four p . m . ( 1200 GMT ) . Another plane followed at a higher altitude a few minutes later . Officials from the Interior Ministry were not immediately available for comment on whether this marked the start of the all - out bombardment threatened by top military officials . On Monday , deputy Russian commander Lieutenant - General Konstantin Pulikovsky gave the rebels 48 hours to withdraw from the city . Civilians flooded out , but the separatists , who captured Grozny on August 6 , have pledged to fight to the death .

Clarke to struggle to find major British tax cuts . Britain ' s Chancellor of the Exchequer , Kenneth Clarke , went into pre - budget meetings with policy advisers on Friday with economic data suggesting that he has little room to cut taxes . But few economists expect him to avoid tax cuts completely in his November budget or bite the bullet and agree an interest rate rise in the run - up to elections , to be held by May 1997 . British finance ministers traditionally retreat with Treasury advisers into rural splendour at Dorneywood , the Chancellor ' s country residence , before the annual budget . Clarke took his team down on Friday to thrash out details , with the meeting continuing on Saturday . The budget is set for November 26 . He has a number of options open to him , should he wish to cut taxes in an attempt to lure disaffected voters back to the fold . But his scope is limited . " The Chancellor will spend this weekend at Dorneywood with a heavy heart , " said Robert Barrie , economist at BZW . He said the state of Britain ' s finances demanded fiscal and monetary tightening , not loosening . " But in the run - up to a general election , both will be left on hold . " Barrie said data this week crystallized Clarke ' s position , showing a tightening labour market feeding through into higher pay settlements and posing an inflationary threat . A sharp 35 , 600 fall in unemployment in September , taking the total number of jobless to a five - and - a - half year low , was coupled with a pick - up in annual average earnings growth to 4 . 0 percent in July and August . September ' s public sector borrowing requirement ( PSBR ) - - the gap between government spending and revenues - - was well above forecasts at 3 . 4 billion pounds ( $ 5 . 4 billion ) . The Treasury has already raised its forecast for the 1996 / 97 PSBR to 27 . 0 billion pounds from 22 . 5 billion but analysts fear that target could be missed . So tax cuts , reducing revenues , hardly seem a good idea , unless offset by spending cuts . Britain ' s public debt has been boosted by overshooting government spending . " The risks that spending cannot be controlled as tightly as planned . . . imply a cautious budget , " according to analysts at Goldman Sachs . In a recent " Green Budget " , produced with the Institute for Fiscal Studies , Goldman Sachs predicted modest tax cuts worth around three billion pounds in November . " The Chancellor will have to consider vociferous calls for tax reductions from his own party . It would be very surprising in this context not to see reductions in headline tax rates , " it said . The ruling Conservatives still trail by 20 points or more in opinion polls and are desperate for action to close the gap . Kevin Gardiner , economist at Morgan Stanley , said Clarke could afford tax cuts of three billion pounds at most and would endeavour to present his budget as a neutral one by reducing planned spending totals . Three billion pounds in cuts could see one / two pence taken off the basic income tax rate of 24 percent . " He could also try to steal Labour ' s thunder by raising personal allowances and lowering the starting rate of income tax , " Gardiner said . The opposition Labour Party has pledged a starting rate of income tax of 10 percent in the long term . It is now 20 percent . Industry groups are pleading for spending to be maintained in key areas , not sacrificed on the altar of tax cuts . This week , the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) urged the Chancellor not to cut taxes or interest rates . But such a strategy would win few votes . " Let ' s get real , " one financial analyst said . " It is a pre - election budget . " ( $ 1 = . 6298 Pound )

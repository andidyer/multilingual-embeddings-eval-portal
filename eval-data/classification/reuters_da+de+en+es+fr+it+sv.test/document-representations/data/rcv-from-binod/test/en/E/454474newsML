BOE ' s George called for 1 / 4 point rate rise in Feb . Bank of England Governor Eddie George told Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke at the their February 5 monetay meeting that he should raise interest rates by a quarter of a point from 6 . 0 percent . George said that while the economy was not accelerating out of hand , it was picking up to a pace that could not be sustained for long consistently with the 2 . 5 percent target for underlying inflation ( RPIX ) . " The Bank continued to advise that , to have a reasonable chance of hitting the inflation target two years ' ahead , the Chancellor needed to begin to take action now to moderate the pace of domestic demand by raising interest rates by 1 / 4 of a percent , " the minutes said . George noted that retail sales and external demand were easing back but said the Bank was worried by the pace of monetary growth . " The Bank ' s concern . . . was not that monetary growth was currently accelerating , it was the persistence of its unsustainably rapid rate of growth . " " The Bank still thought the odds were against meeting the inflation target of 2 . 5 percent or less for RPIX two years ahead , " the minutes added . Clarke said new data since the last meeting had not caused him to change his mind . They continued to show a strong healthy recovery that was sustainable . He saw " no signs of inflationary pressures yet at a level which required action to be taken . In his view , the economy was on course to meet the inflation target two years out . " Clarke said he agreed with the Governor that exchange rate movements should not be allowed to govern monetary policy , but they could not be ignored either . He said sterling ' s strength was already beginning to affect export demand and this influence was likely to continue . The Chancellor added that he was ready to step in when and if the economy did begin to grow unsustainably fast . - - Kate Kelland , London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774

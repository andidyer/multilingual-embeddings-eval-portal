RESEARCH ALERT - CATHAY ESTIMATES CUT . Salomon Brothers said it had cut its 1997 earnings estimate for Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd by 9 . 7 percent to HK $ 3 . 27 billion , due to lower - than - expected interim results from the Hong Kong carrier . It also revised down its 1998 earnings forecast by 16 percent to HK $ 3 . 98 billion , Salomon Brothers said in a report . Cathay posted a 35 percent drop in interim net profit to HK $ 1 . 07 billion , HK $ 82 million below Salomon ' s forecast of HK $ 1 . 15 billion , the brokerage said . " The result was pressured by weak currencies , competitive pressures on yields , softer passenger load factors offset by strong cargo loads , little benefit from fuel price declines , the temporary grounding of the airline ' s A330 fleet and weak Japanese traffic , " Salomon said . The brokerage also reduced its dividend estimates to HK $ 0 . 43 for 1997 and HK $ 0 . 41 for 1998 since it said Cathay needed to conserve cash ahead of its large capital expenditure budget during 1997 and 1998 . Salomon has a hold rating on the stock . - - Hong Kong News Room ( 852 ) 2843 6369

Britain ' s Portman in move to deter ' carpetbaggers ' . Britain ' s Portman building society on Thursday moved to stem a flood of speculators opening accounts in the hope of a bonanza on any stock market conversion by raising the minimum balance for new accounts to 1 , 000 pounds ( $ 1 , 640 ) . The change will take effect from close of business on Thursday and apply to all its current savings products . The Bournemouth - based building society has seen new account openings triple across its 108 branches in recent weeks . So - called ' carpetbaggers ' have been rushing to open accounts at Britain ' s leading building societies , entitling them to a one - off payout should they convert to a bank in the future . Halifax and Alliance & Leicester account holders have already reaped the benefits of conversion earlier this summer , pocketing thousands of pounds in the process . The Nationwide building society , is attempting to fight off an attempt by some of its members to force it to convert . It said yesterday it was closing its doors to new savings account customers after openings leapt to 25 , 000 a day , as many as would usually expect to open in a good week . Portman chief executive Ken Culley said they had reached Thursday ' s decision with great reluctance . " Unfortunately the current volume of speculative account openings is threatening to overwhelm some of our branches and is resulting in diminished levels of service for our established customers . " He said Portman would be keeping the situation under close review . " When the tidal wave of speculative activity shows signs of receding then we hope to restore our minimum opening requirements to their established lower levels . " Until now Portman ' s had maintained its minimum opening requirement for its Instant Access account at 100 pounds and at 500 pounds for its fixed rate savings products .

Yeltsin doctors ' decision to seal political future . Boris Yeltsin ' s doctors meet this week to weigh up their options and decide if , when and how to perform an operation to relieve his heart problems . On those decisions hangs not just the life of the 65 - year - old president who guided Russia through the early days of democracy and into an unpredictable political future . Potential successors are already manoeuvring for power . As Yeltsin lies in hospital , his doctors are making clear that their choices and surgical procedures are far from simple . Renat Akchurin , who is tipped to operate on him , revealed at the weekend that Yeltsin had probably had a third , undisclosed , heart attack just before his re - election in July and might be too sick for bypass surgery to relieve clogged cardiac arteries . Amid signs of reluctance among Russian surgeons to shoulder responsibility alone , top foreign cardiologists including U . S . pioneer Michael DeBakey will be consulted before a doctors ' council meets on Wednesday or Thursday to decide on the surgery . Yeltsin said a fortnight ago he would have the operation at the end of the month . But Akchurin said it may well be put off . That would prolong agonising political uncertainty and leave the president , three months into a new four - year term , confined to the " passive " life he said he chose surgery to escape . Around him , officials would continue to jockey for power while maintaining a discretion born perhaps of good manners but also of a prudent awareness that Yeltsin may make a recovery . Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , 58 , has already been given some extra responsibilities and , the Kremlin clarified last week , would briefly take on full presidential authority if and when the president goes into the operating theatre . His rivals outside his government include Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed , a 46 - year - old reserve general and political novice who makes no secret of presidential ambitions . A third key figure around the sick president is his chief - of - staff Anatoly Chubais . Few see the 41 - year - old liberal economist as a challenger for the succession but his command of the Kremlin administration casts him in the role of kingmaker . A " passive " , inoperable Yeltsin would be a clear target for communist leader Gennady Zyuganov , 52 , the man he beat in the presidential election . Zyuganov says the succession battle has already started and makes clear he wants another shot at power . Soviet communists became experts at maintaining invalids such as Leonid Brezhnev at the helm for years . But their heirs are likely to call for new elections if Yeltsin is incapacitated . Even if the president were to brush aside demands to stand down , his life expectancy without surgery must be questionable . Should the doctors decide next week to operate , the risks are equally hazy , both for Yeltsin and for Russian politics . Details of his health are sketchy but , to judge by doctors ' comments , he may run a higher risk of dying on the operating table than the two percent average for bypass patients . Were he to die or be left incapacitated , the constitution stipulates Chernomyrdin would take over with a mandate to organise a new presidential election within three months . Without Yeltsin to rally them , the Kremlin establishment could find it hard to unite behind a single candidate , renewing the possibility of the communist victory that had seemed likely early this year before Yeltsin threw himself into campaigning . Chernomyrdin might stand . So too might Lebed . Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov , 60 , another Yeltsin ally , could be a contender . On July 3 , Russians voted decisively against a return to communist rule . The president beat Zyuganov by 13 . 5 points . But his campaign promises of better times to come have soured in much of the country , where millions are still owed months of back pay and strikes are mulitplying . It is fertile territory for Zyuganov to build on his 30 million votes . That prospect , however , would raise again the unanswered questions for Russia ' s fledgling democracy - - would the Kremlin meekly accept electoral defeat ? Or can Russian democracy outlive Boris Yeltsin ? As the head of the presidential medical centre , Sergei Mironov , put it on Friday when briefing reporters on Yeltsin ' s and the surgeons ' problems : " You all understand what is at stake . "

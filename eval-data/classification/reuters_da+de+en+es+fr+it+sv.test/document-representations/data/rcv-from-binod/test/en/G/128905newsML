SOCCER SHOWCASE - KLINSMANN SUFFERS FRUSTRATING NIGHT . Bayern Munich ' s prolific striker Juergen Klinsmann suffered another frustrating night as his team were held to a goalless draw by champions Borussia Dortmund in the German first division on Sunday . Klinsmann , Germany ' s captain and hero of Euro 96 , failed to show his usual sharpness in front of goal as the Bavarians were foiled by a brilliant performance by Dortmund goalkeeper Stefan Klos on a damp night in Munich ' s Olympic stadium . Bayern stayed level on points with leaders VfB Stuttgart who also drew 0 - 0 at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday . Both teams are four points ahead of fourth - placed Dortmund . But the Bavarians , who have won the German title a record 13 times , will be upset for not taking three points from an entertaining game which they controlled for long periods . Klinsmann , who scored twice last weekend but has generally struggled to find the net this season , was annoyed that he did not take his chances in the vital top - of - the - table clash . " What we really wanted was those three points , " he said . " We wanted to win here to get ahead in the title race . " Klinsmann worked hard but lacked the composure and deadly accuracy which has helped him to perform at such at high level at major international tournaments in recent years . In the 11th minute all Klinsmann needed to do was square the ball across the goal to two unmarked team mates but the striker hit the ball straight into the arms of the diving Klos . In the 51st minute , Klinsmann struck a good chance over the top of the bar after a great run down the left by midfielder Mehmet Scholl . In the 66th minute , the forward was frustrated by Klos again when the Dortmund ' keeper stopped his left - foot shot on the turn . Klos , one of the smallest goalkeepers in the Bundesliga , was by far the best player on the pitch . His best save came in the first half when he dived acrobatically to turn Mario Basler ' s fierce long - range effort over the bar . But after the interval the Dortmund goalkeeper also reacted superbly to keep out shots from Marcel Witeczek and Dietmar Hamann . " He ' s really played world class in the last few weeks . I hope he can get a place in the national squad , " said Dortmund ' s influential midfielder Andy Moeller , who had a good game after returning from a leg muscle injury . " We could not afford to lose this one otherwise the gap would have got wider . We have to be happy with the result . " The game brought together the cream of German soccer . Fourteen of the country ' s successful Euro 96 squad earn their living at the two clubs . With so much experience on view , the game was bound to be tactical but it also produced some entertaining football for the 63 , 000 capacity crowd . Dortmund , who have struggled with injuries for most of this season , played cautiously and let the Bavarians come at them . Basler was Bayern ' s best player , making some forceful runs from midfield . The visitors ' best chance came in the 10th minute when captain Michael Zorc got on to the end of a cross from Swiss Stephane Chapuisat and forced Bayern ' keeper Oliver Kahn to make a brilliant reaction save with a close - range header . Teams : Bayern Munich - 1 - Oliver Kahn , 10 - Lothar Matthaeus , 2 - Markus Babbel , 15 - Samuel Kuffour , 13 - Mario Basler ( 11 - Marcel Witeczek 65 ) 8 - Thomas Strunz ( 16 - Dietmar Hamann 65 ) , 7 - Mehmet Scholl , 6 - Christian Nerlinger , 3 - Markus Muench , 18 - Juergen Klinsmann , 21 - Alexander Zickler .

French sports minister hails from Communist Party . Marie - George Buffet , one of three Communists in France ' s new Socialist - led cabinet , symbolises a new generation trying to shape a more open Communist Party . At 48 , she was given the youth and sports portfolio in the newly formed government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin . A mother of two and a graduate in history and geography , she joined the party at 20 just after the May 1968 student - workers riots and at a time of demonstrations against the Vietnam war . She rose rapidly through party ranks , joining the central committee in 1987 . Less than a decade later , the party ' s new boss Robert Hue noted her charisma and helped her join the national secretariat . Her openness and talent for human relations was seen as an asset for a Communist Party shedding its hardline Stalinist image after the fall of the Soviet Union . She was put in charge of drafting the report on the party ' s transformation at the last congress . Hue tried to turn her into a familiar face by making her one of the party ' s representatives in television debates during the election campaign that led to a left - wing victory last Sunday . She was elected to the National Assembly for the first time , from the working - class northern Paris suburb of Seine - Saint - Denis . Although she is one of Hue ' s faithful associates , she says she owes her rise in the party to women . She heads the party ' s committee on women . She was a deputy mayor in the Paris suburb of Chatenay - Malabry and a member of the elected regional council of Ile - de - France , the Paris region , in 1977 - 83 . She has sat since 1995 on the town council of Le Plessis - Robinson , also in the Paris area .

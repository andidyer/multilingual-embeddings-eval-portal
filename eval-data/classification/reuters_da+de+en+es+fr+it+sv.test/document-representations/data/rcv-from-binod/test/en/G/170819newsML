Iceland volcano erupts as glacier floods . A violent eruption from an Icelandic volcano on Wednesday sent clouds of ash and smoke soaring 14 , 000 ( 4 , 300 metres ) feet into the air , Iceland meteorologists said . The eruption took place as a vast torrent of water and ice poured from the sides of the glacier that covers the remote volcano in southeast Iceland . Previous eruptions have produced a huge hidden lake that is now spilling over . Officials said the eruption took place shortly before 1500 GMT and was unexpected . Eruptions last month from a nearby volcano - - normally buried under millions of tonnes of ice - - melted vast amounts of water , creating an underground lake that finally cascaded from underneath the glacier on Tuesday . House - sized blocks of ice and millions of tonnes of black , sulphurous water are pouring on to uninhabited regions of Iceland .

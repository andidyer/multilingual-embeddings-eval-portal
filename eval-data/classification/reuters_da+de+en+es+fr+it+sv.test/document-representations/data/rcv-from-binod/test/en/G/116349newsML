SOCCER - AJAX AND RANGERS LIMP INTO EUROPEAN BATTLE . Ajax Amsterdam and Glasgow Rangers are both plagued by injuries as they prepare for Wednesday night ' s European Champions ' League clash in Ajax ' s futuristic new stadium , the Arena . Ajax coach Louis van Gaal , who last week anounced he would quit the club at the end of the season , has been without some of his best players all season , and has seen his side falter both at home and in Europe . Captain Danny Blind and Peter Hoekstra are out long - term and Richard Witschge is only now beginning to recover from injury . Both key strikers Patrick Kluivert and Finn Jari Litmanen are reported to be back doing light training with the squad . Litmanen , the club ' s most prolific scorer in European competition with 19 goals , may play on Wednesday but Kluivert , still nursing a knee ligament injury , is unlikely to appear . Rangers , reeling from a shock 2 - 1 defeat at the hands of Hibernian at the weekend , are similarly depleted . Walter ' s Smith ' s side are short of attackers in particular , with Dutch striker Peter van Vossen stretchered off at the weekend , adding one more to a lengthy injury list . He is now doubtful to play against his former club . Already out are Stephen Wright , Alan McLaren , David Robertson , Trevor Stephen , Ally McCoist and Gordon Durie , while Stuart McCall and Charlie Miller missed Saturday ' s game . Danish stiker Erik Bo Anderson is struggling to recover from a hamstring injury . Van Vossen , who left Ajax 16 months ago , was back training with his old club last week on a trip back to the Netherlands . " They are still an impressive side despite all the injury problems , " he said . " They always play the same way and with the same system no matter what players come and go . " Smith was also cautious about writing Ajax off . " I don ' t think they are in total turmoil as some people might be suggesting , " he said . " They have injury problems and the Bosman ruling affected them during the summer . " There hasn ' t been a better team in Europe over the past three or four years , I don ' t think , but the squad has now undergone a bit of change which is inevitable . " Injuries have been only half the Ajax story this season with the core of the old squad decimated by transfers . Nigerians Nwankwo Kanu and Finidi George , midfield dynamo Edgar Davids and defender Michael Reiziger have all been tempted to Italy and Spain leaving gaps that have been hard to fill . The result has been a dearth of goals - - Ajax have scored just 10 in 10 league games , leaving them in sixth place . In Europe Ajax have continued to struggle , losing at home to Grasshopper Zurich in their last Champions ' League match . Rangers have made a better start on the domestic front and currently top the Scottish premier division . Their weekend defeat by Hibs was their first league loss . But their Champions ' League campaign has started with defeats to both Grasshopper Zurich and Auxerre , result which leave them bottom of Group A .

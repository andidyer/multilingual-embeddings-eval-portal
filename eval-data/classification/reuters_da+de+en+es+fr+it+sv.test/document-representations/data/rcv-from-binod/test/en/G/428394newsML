ALPINE SKIING - VON GRUENIGEN CLINCHES GIANT SLALOM TITLE . Swiss Michael von Gruenigen accomplished his mission in Japan to wrap up the men ' s World Cup giant slalom title with a win on Saturday on the course for next year ' s Nagano Winter Olympics . " I wanted to clinch the title here and not wait until next week , " said von Gruenigen , who won the second - last giant slalom of the season on the sun - splashed Mount Higashidate course in a two - run combined time of two minutes , 41 . 68 seconds . Von Gruenigen , also the reigning world giant slalom champion , took the crown with 560 points , 209 points ahead of his nearest rival Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt , who finished fourth on Saturday . Austria ' s Andreas Schifferer again came close to earning his first World Cup win by placing second in 2 : 42 . 04 . Another Swiss , Paul Accola , who had not mounted a World Cup podium in five years , was third in 2 : 42 . 29 . Von Gruenigen said his goal to clinch the title before the World Cup finals next week in Vail , Colorado , made it difficult for him to take risks in Saturday ' s race . " I was also a little nervous , " said the 27 - year - old mustachioed giant slalom specialist , who racked up his third giant slalom win of the season and 10th World Cup career win . His nerves were not evident on the first run when first out of the gates he set a blistering pace down the technically demanding 1 , 487 - metre course which was unmatched by any of the 59 skiers who followed him . In the second run , von Gruenigen said he stayed cool even after making a few mistakes on the upper section . " I knew I could make it up on the lower part which is very steep and technical , " he said . Schifferer ' s second - place finish matched his previous best World Cup showings , second - place finishes in a super - G last week at Kvitfjell , Norway , and in a downhill two years ago at Bormio , Italy . The 23 - year - old all - rounder said he was rattled by standing second after the first run . " I ' ve never been so close to victory , " he said . " I dont know which event I will win first , but I feel confident I will win this season . " Accola , 30 , who has struggled since winning the World Cup overall crown in 1992 , said his third - place finish was like a rebirth . " For sure , this is my greatest day in five years , " said the Davos native . " I ' ve waited so long to place in the top three . It ' s like a resurrection for me . " Aamodt , who is still chasing speed specialist Luc Alphand of France for the overall title , was shut out of the medals by just one - hundredth of a second . " It ' s too bad because I may need those points , " said Aamodt . " But I didn ' t ski well enough for the podium . " Aamodt ' s teammate Lasse Kjus , defending World Cup overall champion , failed to finish the first run after catching an edge at the bottom of the course . Italian crowd - pleaser Alberto Tomba was knocked out after finishing a dismal 35th in the first run . " I am burned out , " said the 30 - year - old from Bologna . " I don ' t have the energy and training to have a good result on such a demanding course . " Now I don ' t know what will happen with my giant slalom next year , " he added . Tomba , a double Olympic gold medallist in the event , failed to place in a World Cup giant slalom this year and risks being unable to start in the discipline next year unless he can earn at least 400 points before the end of the season . Tomba , who currently has 292 points , has two more chances to boost his total - - Sunday ' s slalom on nearby Mount Yakebitai or the slalom world final in Vail .

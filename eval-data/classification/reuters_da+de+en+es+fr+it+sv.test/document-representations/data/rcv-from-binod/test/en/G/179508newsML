SOCCER - BROOKING NEEDS STITCHES AFTER MEDIA MATCH BRAWL . Former England international Trevor Brooking , now a television commentator , needed four stitches after being involved in a fight with a Georgian journalist during a media match ahead of England ' s World Cup qualifier on Saturday . The former West Ham player , who now works for the British Broadcasting Corportation ( BBC ) was on the receiving end of several crude tackles by Georgian players . " One of them clouted me from behind , " Brooking said . " There was what you might call a verbal exchange . " Then , apparently , while this was going on , another fellow ran 20 yards . I just saw him at the last minute from the side . He thumped me with a real right hook and he must have caught me with a ring or something because he cut me wide open just above the right eye . " I just walked away . I only ever had three bookings in my career and I have never been involved in anything like this . But I knew if I stayed around , it could have got nasty . " Brooking , who was substituted by English Football Association ( F . A . ) chief executive Graham Kelly , was treated by the England team doctor . The match referee sent off two Georgians and the game ended 1 - 1 . Brooking was expected to be fit to take his place in the BBC commentary box at the European group two qualifer between Georgia and England later on Saturday .

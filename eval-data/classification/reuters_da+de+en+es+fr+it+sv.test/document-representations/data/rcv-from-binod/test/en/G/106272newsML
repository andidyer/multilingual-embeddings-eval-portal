Texas student suspended for bottle of Advil . A junior high honour student was suspended on Tuesday for a day after bringing a bottle of non - prescription painkiller Advil to school in her backpack , officials said . The painkiller was found by a drug - sniffing dog going through students ' belongings during gym class . A spokeswoman for the Humble Independent School District just north of Houston said the district ' s policy requires students to give all drugs , prescription or non - prescription , to the school nurse who then dispenses them . " I think the punishment is way too severe . All my grades are going to be affected by this , " the student , Brooke Olson , said after her suspension at Kingwood Middle School . Olson , an honour student and student council member , told reporters that she knew about the district policy , but had forgotten she was carrying the Advil . The school district said the policy was part of their effort to stamp out drug use and protect students . School principal Steve Busch said Advil was just the tip of a potentially lethal drug iceberg . " You go to a grocery store and there ' s a wide range of over - the - counter medications that can have lethal effects on students . So , it ' s easy to minimise this and say , well , it ' s just pain medication - - but it ' s a little more serious than that , " he told reporters . The suspended student ' s mother , Debbie Olson , responded : " I can see where we have to control drugs and I support that , but this was an innocent bottle of Advil . " Last week , a 14 - year - old Ohio student was suspended for four and a half months for giving another student a Midol tablet for relief of menstrual cramps , but the student was allowed to return to class Tuesday after the incident received wide attention . She has filed a lawsuit against the school over her treatment .

Profit - taking ends Chilean bolsa 5 - day bull run . Chilean stocks slumped to a soft close as profit - taking snapped a five - session winning streak with the bolsa expected to remain in negative territory at the opening , said traders . " There ' ll be more of the same tomorrow , " said David Hurd , head of research at Merrill Lynch referring to profit - taking . " The rally was a knee - jerk reaction led by wild rumors that interest rates will come down . " The 40 - share index closed unofficially down 0 . 89 percent at 108 . 07 points . The general index shed 0 . 42 percent to 5 , 140 . 39 points . Turnover shrank to 16 . 1 billion pesos from 22 billion pesos Wednesday . Before Thursday ' s sell - off , blue chip stocks had risen around nine percent on the back of speculation that a cut in interest rates by the Central Bank was imminent . But the optimism was short - lived , with many investors now believing the Bank will not ease up until the end of the March at the earliest , said dealers . Also , analysts only expect modest growth in company earnings in 1997 , which means that such a strong rally at the start of the year cannot not be sustained , said Hurd . " Most analysts are expecting earnings to grow 7 - 10 percent this year , which would suggest a 7 - 10 percent increase in stock prices over the whole year , " he said . Copper products maker Madeco rallied for the second day on news the company has bought a Brazilian cable manufacturer , said traders . Madeco ended up 1 . 87 percent at 1 , 090 pesos . Losers included telecom Telex , down 2 . 34 percent at 1 , 045 pesos , drug - maker LabChile , down 1 . 32 percent at 375 pesos and power utility Endesa , which lost 1 . 27 percent to 234 pesos .

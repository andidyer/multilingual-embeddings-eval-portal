U . S . sends security advisers to tackle Peru crisis . The United States sent security advisers to Peru on Thursday to assist U . S . officials dealing with the hostage crisis in Lima as President Bill Clinton said he was " very concerned " about the captives . " Obviously we are keeping up with it very closely and we ' re very concerned about it , " Clinton said of the hostage drama involving about 400 captives , including many high - ranking diplomats and businessmen . " We ' re concerned about all those held hostage , " Clinton told reporters while posing for pictures at the start of a meeting in the Oval Office . Secretary of State Warren Christopher made clear that Washington ' s concern for the captives should not be viewed as pressure to bow to the demands of the leftist rebels . " The United States has a strong policy against making any concessions and we advise all those involved to follow that policy , " Christopher told a news conference . State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Washington did not wish to " micromanage " the hostage drama , but told reporters : " We don ' t make concessions to terrorists and our advice is that other governments not make concessions either . " " Terrorists win if you give in to them . Terrorists win if you meet their demands , " he said . Hundreds of people are being held in Lima by Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) guerrillas who stormed a reception at the Japanese ambassador ' s residence on Tuesday evening in a bid to win the release of jailed comrades . Burns said the U . S . government had just sent to Lima " a group of American security advisers who will be advising ambassador ( Dennis ) Jett on ways that we can help to protect American citizens . " They had been sent " as a precaution and to basically help ambassador Jett , " he said . The security advisers came from a variety of U . S . government agencies , he added , refusing to give further details . Jett and his deputy chief of mission were at the reception but left before the guerrillas struck . Burns refused to comment on reports that six U . S . officials were among the hostages . Burns said a key task for the U . S . embassy was to ensure protection of about 10 , 000 Americans living in Peru . " You have to prepare yourself for any kind of eventuality , " he said . Attorney General Janet Reno said separately the FBI and Justice Department have been working with Clinton ' s National Security Council staff in reviewing the Lima hostage standoff .

Business generally positive on S . African budget . South African business on Wednesday welcomed Finance Minister Trevor Manuel ' s maiden budget as a confidence - building document which reconciled the government ' s macroeconomic strategy with its development objectives . The South African Chamber of Business ( Sacob ) said the 1997 / 98 budget would promote equity and investor optimism , but government still faced tough decisions . " ( It ) is the first of three budgets in the GEAR ( growth , empowerment and redistribution ) programme . There are formidable decisions to be taken if the macroeconomic strategy is to succeed , " said a statement from Sacob , the country ' s largest business umbrella grouping . The GEAR , which was announced by Manuel in June last year and plots South Africa ' s economic path over the next five years , strives for strong job - creation and solid economic fundamentals . The Afrikaner Handelsinstituut ( AHI ) , a grouping of Afrikaner business interests , said in a statement it supported the budget ' s focus on fiscal discipline and international competitivess . But it was " deeply concerned " at the decline in capital expenditure in nominal terms while increasing emphasis was placed on social spending . Both Sacob and the AHI hailed the announcement that foreign exchange controls would be further relaxed , saying this was a step in the direction of global competitiveness . Sacob also welcomed the budget ' s privatisation intentions - - some of the proceeds will be used to redeem state debt - - and added that many public sector activities would be more effectively handled by private enterprise . Although the business grouping was opposed to ad valorem duties it supported the relief announced in the budget . Manuel said some duties would be lowered to 15 percent from the current 37 . 5 percent . Sacob said it was concerned that the government should ensure the collection of the taxes it levies . The AHI called the increase in excise duties on wine , beer and tobacco " Draconian " , saying they might lead to more smuggling - - exactly the motive Manuel gave for lowering ad valorem duties . Multi - industry giant Anglo American Corp of South Africa said the budget balanced controls on expenditure with efforts to give more attention to social spending . " The spotlight will now fall on the government ' s ability to effectively deliver services within the sound economic framework thus set . " - - Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

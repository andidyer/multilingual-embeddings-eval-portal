IPE Brent climbs to session high on Iran , gasoline . IPE Brent crude rallied to session highs early on Monday afternoon as U . S . gasoline attracted refinery and investment fund buying and dealers digested weekend reports linking Iran with the bombing of a U . S . barracks in Saudi Arabia . " ( U . S . ) gasoline has definitely been leading the way this afternoon but people also seem to be taking the Iran reports a little more seriously , " said a broker . May Brent climbed to an intraday high of $ 18 . 24 a barrel before slipping back to $ 18 . 21 by 1409 GMT , still 33 cents up from Friday ' s close . Brokers said refineries were noted buyers of the May NYMEX gasoline contract . Investment fund interest in the prompt May / June gasoline spread was also helping to boost the complex . The Washington Post on Sunday reported that U . S . and Saudi intelligence authorities had linked a senior Iranian government official to a group suspected of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar U . S . military compound in Saudi Arabia . In Tehran , meanwhile , several hundred students clased with police outside the German embassy during a demonstration against last week ' s Berlin court ruling that Iran ordered the killing of dissidents . Despite the supportive backdrop , and an improving technical picture particularly on NYMEX May crude which left a double bottom on Friday at $ 18 . 96 a barrel , dealers said Brent would struggle to break above nearby resistance in the $ 18 . 30 - $ 18 . 34 range . " It took off early this afternoon but it was in fairly thin volume again so may struggle to break higher , " said a broker . The closure of two of Mexico ' s main crude ports , which shut on Saturday due to violent storms in the Gulf of Mexico , was providing limited support to prices , dealers added . - - Mark Thompson , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7930

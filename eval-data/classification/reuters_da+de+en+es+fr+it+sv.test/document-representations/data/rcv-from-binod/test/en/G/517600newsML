Money , mystery surround Mexican magnate to the end . Emilio Azcarraga , one of the world ' s most powerful media barons , ended his life as he had lived it : in private opulence , cloaked in a miasma of money and mystery . The Mexican magnate , who died of cancer in Miami on Wednesday , spent the last weeks of his life sailing aboard his 240 - foot ( 80 metre ) luxury yacht in the waters off Florida , sources at his billion - dollar media empire Grupo Televisa said on Thursday . Maintaining their late boss ' s legendary aversion to media attention , staff aboard his yacht Eco rebuffed enquiries on Thursday . " We ' ve got no comment , thank you , " one said before hanging up . Shipping company officials said Eco , named after Azcarraga ' s international TV news channel , was custom - made in Germany for a billionaire whose media empire made him one of the richest men in Latin America . " The yacht . . . is high - performance , very sleek , all white , about 240 feet ( 80 metres ) . . . it would be in the $ 40 million to $ 42 million range , " Brian Anderson of Strachan Shipping Company told Reuters . " It has lots of cabins . . . all the features you might see on a yacht and some you might not think of . " It was not clear whether Azcarraga , who was 66 , died at sea or in the hospital in Miami . Televisa said his remains would be cremated on Thursday and his ashes flown to Mexico , but company officials and spokesmen declined to comment on the exact circumstances of his death . A spokeswoman for the Cedars Medical Centre in central Miami said an Emilio Azcarraga had been treated at the hospital ' s emergency room on March 27 , but had no other information . No other major hospital had a record of him as a recent patient . A drawn , ill - looking Azcarraga , who was nicknamed " The Tiger " and was married five times , announced on March 3 in Los Angeles that he was stepping down after 23 years at the helm of Televisa . His son Emilio Azcarraga Jean , 29 , took over the reins in partnership with former chief financial officer Guillermo Canedo White . Despite his reputation as a fearsome businessman who put political ties above journalistic objectivity , Azcarraga was also remembered with fondness by some U . S . acquaintances for his personal charm . One friend recently told how Azcarraga repaid a Los Angeles woman ' s help in finding a missing piece for his backgammon set by ordering $ 25 , 000 worth of office furniture from her store - - and sending it all to a warehouse to gather dust .

Birch rejects claim NZ sold forests too cheaply . New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch rejected a claim by a Cantebury University lecturer that Forestry Corporation was sold for $ 850 million less than what it was worth . Forest economist Ted Bilek told Radio New Zealand he had just finished research on the sale which showed Forestry Corporation could be valued at close to $ 3 billion . Bilek said the $ 2 . 03 billion sale was subsidised by the government to the tune of around $ 850 million . But Birch said Bilek had his sums wrong . Forestry Corp paid an average annual dividend of $ 94 . 5 million in the six years from 1990 / 91 to 1995 / 6 not the $ 232 million annual average used in Bilek ' s analysis , Birch said . " Furthermore , Forestry Corporation forecasted dividends of $ 72 million in 1996 / 97 and $ 73 million in 1997 / 98 . Not $ 232 million in each of those years as claimed by Bilek . " In addition to dividend payouts , Forestry Corp repaid $ 218 million of redeemable preference shares to the government and $ 375 million of debt . But these payments were " one - off " and would not have continued , said Birch " They did not affect the final sale value of Forestry Corp . " Bilek was critical of the whole sale process and said the Corporation could have afforded to develop ownward processing and not raise its debt to unacceptable levels . However , Birch said the government received a very good price , which was the maximum available in the market at the time . " The sale to the Fletcher Challenge - led consortium valued Forestry Corporation ' s assets at $ 2 . 026 billion , this exceeded book value and was at the top end of most commentators ' expectations .

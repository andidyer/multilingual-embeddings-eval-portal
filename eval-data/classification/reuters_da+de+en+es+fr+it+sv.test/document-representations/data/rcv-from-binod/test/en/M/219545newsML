NWE naphtha prices ended slightly higher on Wednesday , continuing to draw support from steady crude oil values and arbitrage interest to the States , traders and brokers said .

A port official did not know when it would reopen . Three cargoes delayed by the weather all had homes and one end - user was believed to have bought two cargoes late last week to alleviate some supply pressure .

Demand for heavier N + A grades was still seen lacklustre due to a negative naphtha / gasoline crack spread . - - John Hanley , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8185

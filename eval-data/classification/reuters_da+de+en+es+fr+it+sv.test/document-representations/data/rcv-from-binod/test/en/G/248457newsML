CRICKET - INDIA WITHIN SIGHT OF SERIES VICTORY . India ' s bowlers , inspired by former captain Mohammed Azharuddin ' s unbeaten 163 , carried their side to the brink of a first series victory over South Africa in the third and final test on Wednesday . The South Africans , set an impossible target of 461 to win , had slumped to 127 for five by the close on the fourth day and facing the near - certainty of a 2 - 1 series reverse on the last day . Azharuddin , sacked as captain earlier this year and nearly dropped from the side altogether , punished the tourists ' attack in the first session after starting the day 12 runs short of his century . The elegant 33 - year - old right - hander , who scored a 74 - ball hundred in Calcutta , duly completed his 16th century in 75 tests and by the declaration had struck 25 boundaries and a six off Pat Symcox in a 288 - ball stay . His sixth - wicket stand of 165 with Dravid ( 56 ) , was an Indian record for any wicket against South Africa . India finally called a halt at their lunch score of 400 for seven , setting the South Africans a target never achieved by a side batting last in 120 years of test cricket . South Africa suffered an early blow when left - hander Gary Kirsten , who scored centuries in both innings of the second test at Calcutta , was trapped leg before for seven by Javagal Srinath . Herschelle Gibbs was bowled by Venkatesh Prasad for five and Darryl Cullinan , at the non - striker ' s end , was run out for two by a direct hit from Tendulkar at mid - off . Skipper Hansie Cronje hit 50 to provide some resistance , sharing a 58 - run fourth - wicket partnership with opener Andrew Hudson ( 31 ) before Hudson was caught by substitute Vangipurappu Laxman off leg - spinner Anil Kumble at forward short - leg . Cronje hit eight boundaries , four in one over from left - arm spinner Sunil Joshi , before falling to the same bowler when Tendulkar took a well - measured catch at extra cover . India could have been in an even stronger position had they not spilt three catches . Kumble failed to hold on to a return catch from Brian McMillan , who was also dropped by Woorkeri Raman off Joshi . Rahul Dravid also dropped Richardson off Joshi at forward short - leg . India , who have not lost a home series since their 1986 - 87 defeat to Pakistan , won the opening test in Ahmedabad , but South Africa levelled the series with a crushing 329 - run triumph in Calcutta .

Mubarak says no discrimination against Copts . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said there was no institutionalised discrimination against Christian Copts in Egypt , the official al - Ahram newspaper reported on Friday . Mubarak was asked in an interview about a law in Egypt requiring special approval to build churches and which was said to be used by people abroad to accuse Egypt of mistreating Copts . " First of all we do not treat Copts in the way these claims levelled against us say , " Mubarak said . " There have been cases of repairs or renovations of churches which we allowed . There has not been any case of a request to build a church appearing and it has not been approved . " Official figures estimate Christians account for 10 percent of Egypt ' s 60 million people , but Christians give a slightly higher figure . Copts also complain that they have never held top ministerial posts and are sometimes discriminated against in the workplace . " I personally don ' t differentiate between a Moslem and a Christian , " Mubarak was quoted as saying . " My measurement is that it ' s enough if he is an Egyptian , be he Moslem or Christian . " Militants have targeted Christians along with senior officials , policemen and occasionally tourists in their attempt to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamist state . Suspected militants massacred 10 Christians in a church in southern Egypt in February and shot dead 13 people in a predominantly Christian hamlet in the south a month later .

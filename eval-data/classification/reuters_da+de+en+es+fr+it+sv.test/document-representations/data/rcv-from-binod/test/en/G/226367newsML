FEATURE - Chinese medicine threatens Sumatran tiger . Two of Indonesia ' s three species of tigers have become extinct and the third is severely threated because of the belief that tiger parts can improve sexual performance , experts say . According to traditional Chinese medical belief , mental problems , laziness , malaria , epilepsy , toothache and lack of sexual appetite can be treated with tiger parts , leading to rampant poaching of the animal in Asia , the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) said . " Poaching is changing all the time . . . this trend for tiger products is new . There are people wanting tiger products who didn ' t want them before , " Ron Lilley , coordinator for species conservation at the WWF in Jakarta , told Reuters . Lilley said tigers in Indonesia , now reduced to about 500 animals on the island of Sumatra , are particularly vulnerable . Poaching is a severe threat , with huge markets for tiger bones in China , South Korea and Taiwan . " This is . . . perhaps a billion - dollar industry , mostly illegal and run by people not interested in sustainability , " he said . According to South Korean immigration statistics , the country imported 3 , 994 kilograms ( 8787 pounds ) of tiger bones from Indonesia between 1970 and 1993 , making Indonesia their largest supplier . That ' s a lot of tigers , Lilley said , since the bones of one tiger weigh less than 10 kilograms ( 22 pounds ) . Speaking this week after the announcement of a joint venture with photo equipment manufacturer Kodak , which has pledged 50 million rupiah ( $ 21 , 000 ) to saving the Sumatran tiger , Lilley said he was not hopeful for the survival of the species . " Our estimate is that 14 tigers are killed every year . . . maybe more . A population of less than 100 tigers has a very low possibility of surviving for the next 50 years because there can be no genetic transfer between generations , " he said . Extinction of the tiger is a real fear in Indonesia , which has seen the Bali tiger die out In the 1940s and the Java tiger disappear in the late 1980s . Despite concerns over poaching , the biggest threat to the Sumatran tiger is the destruction of its habitat , Lilley said . " Tiger populations have crashed without exception in all areas of the world , " Lilley said . In Indonesia , this was " in the balance because conservation areas are being eaten into . " The WWF estimates the world tiger population at about 7 , 200 . There are around 3 , 750 Bengal tigers left in India and just under 2 , 000 tigers in Southeast Asia , excluding Indonesia . Subijanto , a spokesman for the Forestry Ministry , said Indonesia was commited to protecting the tigers , which live within Sumatra ' s four designated conservation areas . The Kerinci conservation project , an area of around three million hectares ( 7 . 4 million acres ) in west Sumatra , was being supported by funds from the World Bank , Subijanto said . Whilse the Sumatran tiger is a fully protected species under the 1990 Conservation Act , Lilley said the amount of money to be made by developing land in a burgeoning Asian economy such as Indonesia often led to the violation of conservation boundaries . " There is not as much money generated in leaving a conservation area as it is . . . as there is in building big roads , airstrips , big hotels , swimming pools . . . , " he said . Agus Purnomo , director of WWF Indonesia , said the 50 million rupiah donated by Kodak would be used specifically to help the survival of the Sumatran tiger . He did not elaborate . Lilley said the money could go to produce information to improve Indonesians ' awareness of conservation areas . " One thing the WWF is trying to do is to work with the Education Departement to try and insert more conservation messages into the formal ( school ) curriculum , " he said . But it is the people who believe medicine made from tiger bones can improve sexual ability that need educating , Agus said . " A tiger can only make love for seven seconds , therefore , why should we use their bones for aphrodisiacs ? " he said .

Australian bond yields ended below the day ' s highs , but never looked like making a full recovery after an early sharp sell - off as events this week left the monetary policy outlook unclear . The benchmark 10 - year bond yield came close to testing 7 . 25 percent just after the opening , having brushed 7 . 0 percent at the start of the week . A strong quarterly capital expenditure report , still high wages growth through enterprise bargaining agreements and a cautiously balanced speech by RBA governor Ian Macfarlane saw bond prices and bill futures make lows for the week initially . Addressing the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia ( CEDA ) on Thursday , Macfarlane said wage bargaining tensions were clouding the inflation outlook and excessive wage rises were difficult for monetary policy . He also said that while the unemployment rate was too high , too easy a policy could cause job losses in the medium term . Today ' s monthly Australian interest rates poll of 29 economists ahead of next Tuesday ' s RBA board meeting gave just a 10 percent chance of an easing in December after the 50 basis point cut in November . However , the survey showed a 50 percent possibility of an easing in the first quarter next year . Meanwhile , the October balance of payments showed the seasonally adjusted current account deficit at A $ 1 . 788 billion and on the high side of expectations , although this had little impact on the market . The widening from A $ 1 . 69 billion in the September shortfall , and despite a 1 . 0 percent rise in exports , was blamed on a further increase in the net income deficit to A $ 1 . 910 billion . Economists said the data had no implications for policy , but did once again highlight the national savings problem . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( SPREADS ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - AUD VS 3 - YR 10 - YR * AUD 3 - YR / 10 - YR SPREAD USD 87 ( + 06 ) 109 ( + 05 ) * FUTURES 56 . 5 ( - 01 . 5 ) CAD 241 ( + 10 ) 114 ( + 05 ) * CASH 59 ( - 01 ) NZD - 29 ( + 06 ) + 14 ( + 05 ) * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The local market ' s weak performance saw yield spreads to other dollar bloc bonds continue this week ' s widening trend .

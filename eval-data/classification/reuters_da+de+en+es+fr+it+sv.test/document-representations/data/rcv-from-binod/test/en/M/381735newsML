FOCUS - Dollar ends above 1 . 70 marks in 34 - month high . The dollar climbed above 1 . 70 marks for the first time since April 1994 at the European close on Monday , continuing its relentless rise on the back of solid economic fundamentals , dealers said . The dollar was bid up to a fresh 34 - month high against the mark but failed to make much headway above 1 . 70 marks due to lack of follow - through buying as U . S . markets were closed for a holiday . But 1 . 70 marks is not the limit yet , analysts said . " The outlook for the dollar is still positive , in view of continued economic problems in Germany and Japan , " said Gerard Lyons , chief economist at DKB International . At 1615 GMT the dollar traded at 1 . 7004 marks , up from 1 . 6880 at the European close on Friday . Against the yen , it was at 124 . 40 , up from 124 . 23 . The Dollar was also buoyant against the Swiss franc , trading at a fresh three - year high at 1 . 4820 francs , up from 1 . 4640 late on Friday . Against the yen , the dollar was also invigorated but concern that central banks might intervene to stem its rise put a lid on further increases . Japan is generally believed to be the least happy of the G3 with persistent dollar strength , meaning the market has focused on the Bank of Japan for possible central bank action . But the Bundesbank last week joined the protest against further dollar gains , and its vice - president Johann - Wilhelm Gaddum told Reuters today he saw no reason for a weaker mark . But with players convinced that fundamentals favour a strong dollar , unilateral - - or even concerted - - intervention is unlikely to cool their ardour , traders and analysts said . The rally has been fired by relatively higher U . S . rates , the prospect of solid growth and dollar - positive capital flows . " If the market feels it ' s only odd people within G7 who want this to stop , or they feel they ' re only going to have a tickle with it , I think the market will take the dollar higher , " said Graham Cocks , vice - president , treasury at Bank of Boston here . It requires a fundamental reassessment of econonomic prospects for the dollar ' s bullish trend to finish , analysts said .

Impassive Rao appears before India court . Former Indian prime minister P . V . Narasimha Rao appeared before a judge at a heavily - guarded makeshift court on Wednesday , his first trial appearance in a string of legal cases that have clouded his legacy . Plainclothes commandos ushered Rao , 75 , from a bullet - proof car to an annexe at New Delhi ' s Vigyan Bhavan conference hall complex to face charges in a seven - year - old criminal forgery case . In the windowless courtroom , Rao was flanked by four bodyguards and sat apart from three co - accused in the case , including an ex - minister and a Hindu guru . Rao remained impassive while his lawyer R . K . Anand argued that the charges , which carry a maximum sentence of seven years in jail , were " fabricated " . The session was still in progress three hours after it started . Rao is the first former or serving prime minister to appear in court to face criminal charges . Former prime minister Indira Gandhi was summoned to court in a civil case in 1977 after a state of emergency imposed by her ended . Rao ' s appearance at the trial hearing capped weeks of legal manoeuvring in a tangled web of cases that have undercut his authority within the Congress party , which suffered a humiliating defeat in general elections in April and May . He resigned in disgrace as Congress chief in September after a judge upheld a summons ordering him to appear in court in a separate criminal cheating case . But he remains head of Congress ' s parliamentary delegation and retains political clout . His influence is magnified by Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda ' s dependence on Congress support to help thwart potential challenges from right - wing Hindu nationalists in parliament . Deve Gowda ' s 13 - party centre - left coalition does not control an outright majority in the lower house of parliament and needs Congress ' s backing . Rao ' s legal woes have compounded his party ' s misfortunes following its worst defeat in the general elections . The small , carpeted courtroom - - chosen by police as a substitute venue considered more secure than crowded local courts - - was filled with two dozen reporters and Congress leaders . No TV cameras or photographers were allowed . Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad and former cabinet ministers Pranab Mukherjee and V . C . Shukla attended the hearing , dominated by arguments over bail . Rao remained silent and expressionless as his lawyer , Anand , argued that the temporary bail , which was granted on October 9 and protects the former prime minister against arrest , should be extended beyond its November 6 expiration date . The Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) , India ' s federal police , on September 26 charged Rao and the three others with involvement in an alleged attempt in 1989 to defame V . P . Singh , a Congress rebel who later became prime minister . They are alleged to have forged documents which aimed to show that Singh ' s son held $ 21 million in a bank account on the Caribbean island of St Kitts . Rao has not commented publicly on the case . " The entire case against me is motivated and fabricated , " Anand , speaking for a silent Rao , told chief metropolitan magistrate Prem Kumar . " There is no case against me . " It was not known when Kumar would rule on the bail request .

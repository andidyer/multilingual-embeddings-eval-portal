Nicaragua ' s Sandinistas appeal to former foes . Nicaragua ' s left - wing Sandinista Front on Monday appealed to former foes living in exile in the United States to support them in this country ' s Oct . 20 presidential election . " ( Exiles ) should urge their relatives in Nicaragua to vote for the Sandinista Front as the best way to reduce poverty and unemployment in their native land , " Sandinista vice presidential candidate Juan Manuel Caldera said at a news conference after a seven - day trip to the United States . Caldera ' s trip was part of a Sandinista " charm offensive " to assure foreign investors and the U . S . government they have left behind their radical left - wing roots and were willing to work with private enterprise and foreign companies . Caldera said he met with Nicaraguan exile groups and business leaders in Los Angeles , New York and Miami , and told them a future Sandinista government would welcome foreign investment and returning exiles . The Nicaraguan exile community in the United States is largely anti - Sandinista . Miami was a center of anti - Sandinista activity during the eight - year civil war against the Sandinista government in the 1980s . While these exiles have the right to vote in Nicaragua , only about 950 have registered to do so , according to Nicaragua ' s Supreme Election Council . " In Nicaragua we need these people who have American business training , and it would be an important achievement for us if they returned to Nicaragua , " Caldera said . More than 500 , 000 Nicaraguans live in the United States , many having fled the 1979 - 1990 Sandinista regime or the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza that preceded it . These half - million Nicaraguan expatriots send $ 600 million a year to their families in Nicaragua , keeping its economy afloat , he said . Caldera is a non - Sandinista rancher whose property was confiscated by the Sandinista government . Analysts have said he was made longtime Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega ' s running mate to show they have left behind their radical roots . Ortega currently trails Arnoldo Aleman of the conservative Liberal Alliance 41 percent to 35 percent in the latest poll .

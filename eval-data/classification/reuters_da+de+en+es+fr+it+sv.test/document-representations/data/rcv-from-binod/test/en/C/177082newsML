Axa seen unlikely to bid for UAP . Shares of France ' s largest insurer UAP hit their highest level on Friday since early March amid renewed market talk Axa was eyeing it as a takeover target but financial analysts said the companies made an unlikely match . UAP ' s shares closed up 6 . 27 percent at 116 . 90 francs while Axa ' s shares were down nearly one percent at 318 . 50 francs . Analysts said struggling Union des Assurances de Paris would be an improbable fit for France ' s most profitable insurer and that there would be too much overlap in their activities . " The last thing Axa wants to do is build up its presence by buying worn out competitors , " said one analyst who did not want to be named . " It has other growth ideas outside France , other ideas of how to grow organically . There would be huge overlap . " Axa won applause last year when it moved to take a 51 percent stake in Australia ' s second largest life insurer , National Mutual , which gave it a foothold in the fast - growing Asian market . Analysts said the deal was in the same vein as its 1991 buy of Equitable Cos which has provided a rich profit stream . But they said a bid for UAP would represent a departure from Axa ' s strategy of targeting undervalued companies offering potential big rewards . " I don ' t see that at its current price , UAP represents outstanding value , " said another analyst . " Axa has made a diet of taking over ailing companies but I ' d like to hope this deal is one they could pass up , " said a third analyst . Until now , they added , Axa has been attractive for its lack of exposure to the French market - - less than one third of its profits come from France . But a takeover of UAP would end that . " The positive aspects of Axa have been its diversification into international markets , " said one analyst . Axa has changed beyond all recognition in the past few years , growing from a sleepy mutual company in the 1980s into a global player . Takeover rumours singling out Axa as the potential buyer have stalked UAP since the beginning of the year as a result of its weak share price . The firm was privatised in May 1994 at 152 francs per share to small investors but its shares have slid and UAP has been undergoing major financial restructuring . The rumours took on new life last week , sending UAP ' s shares higher , following an article in the weekly magazine Nouvel Observateur suggesting Axa was eyeing the insurer . Axa dismissed again on Friday the speculation , saying it was not in talks with UAP . UAP also reiterated there were no talks . Analysts said UAP ' s weak profitability would not fit in with Axa ' s goal of boosting its return on equity to 15 percent after the year 2000 , up from 10 . 9 percent currently . UAP ' s return on equity is just five percent . UAP has taken massive provisions to cover exposure to France ' s ongoing property crisis from which Axa has been relatively spared . UAP reported a seven percent rise in first - half profits to 860 million francs after a big 2 . 0 billion franc loss for 1995 . Analysts said they were now looking to Axa , whose first - half profits rocketed 52 percent to 1 . 98 billion francs , to deliver improvements in return on equity through organic growth rather than new takeovers . Axa recently announced that it had a 30 billion franc war chest , the same amount as analysts calculate it would roughly cost to take over UAP . But analyst say it would be too big a sum . " The sheer size would be a mouthful , " one said .

Separatist wants Kashmiris in India - Pakistan talks . A popular Kashmiri separatist leader urged India and Pakistan on Monday to involve Kashmiris in rare talks later this month between the two neighbouring countries . " Any process of talks , at whatever level , between India and Pakistan without the participation of the people of Jammu and Kashmir can prove unproductive and futile as it has proved in the past , " Shabir Ahmad Shah said in a statement . India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 over Jammu and Kashmir state , which is disputed by Islamabad . India controls two - thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest . Foreign secretaries , or top civil servants , of the two nations are scheduled to meet in New Delhi from March 28 to 31 to revive talks stalled since January 1994 . No agenda has been announced for the talks but Pakistan earlier insisted Kashmir must be on the agenda of any dialogue between the arch - rivals . Shah , considered one of the most popular separatist leaders in Kashmir , was suspended in August last year from a 30 - party alliance of Kashmiri separatist groups , the All Parties Hurriyat ( Freedom ) Conference , because he held a meeting with the U . S . ambassador , Frank Wisner against the Hurriyat ' s wishes . Shah spent 20 years in different Indian jails before he was released in October 1994 . Amnesty International declared him a " prisoner of conscience . " " We would like to act as a bridge between India and Pakistan to bring peace in the region , " Shah ' s statement said . More than 20 , 000 people have been killed in a seven - year - old rebellion in the mountainous Himalayan state , which is mainly Hindu India ' s only Moslem majority province . India accuses Pakistan of arming Kashmiri guerrillas but Islamabad denies the charge .

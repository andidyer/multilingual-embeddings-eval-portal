Arafat says Israel - PLO talks resume on Thursday . Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Monday Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would resume talks on Thursday to revive stalled peace talks . " The Cairo meeting was a preliminary meeting and next Thursday we will continue the meeting , " Arafat told reporters after talks with Jordan ' s Prime Minister Abdul Salam al - Majali . Prodded by Egypt which has been intensifying its mediation to revive the impasse in the peace process , Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met formally for the first time in more than two months in Cairo on Sunday . Peace talks have been frozen since Israel began a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March . Palestinians have demanded Israel halt construction before peace talks can resume . Asked about reports that Israel had committed itself to a pledge to freeze settlement building as a condition to resume peace talks , Arafat said : " Unfortunately there are no Israeli promises to stop settlements . " Diplomatic sources say Egypt is pushing a five - point plan which included a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank for " a sufficient period " . In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel ' s security demands . " We insist on a clear position in all its dimensions by the Israeli side , " Arafat said . Arafat added that Israel should not " run away from its commitments and the honest implementation of what had been agreed " , under a 1993 Israel - Palestinian peace accord . Earlier a senior Palestinian official said the talks with Israel could resume on Thursday . Tayeb Abdel - Rahim , secretary - general of Arafat ' s office , also expressed surprise at comments by Egyptian and Israeli officials that progress had been made on Sunday .

SOCCER - VIERI SAYS JUVE SHOULD SELL HIM . Italian striker Christian Vieri thinks serie A side Juventus would miss a great opportunity if they refused to sell him to Spanish club Atletico Madrid for next season . " Thirty five billion lire ( $ 21 . 9 milliom ) is an enormous fee . If I were in the shoes of my managers I wouldn ' t have to think about it too long : I ' d let Vieri go , " the 23 - year - old striker was quoted as saying in Turin newspaper Tuttosport . Juventus have said repeatedly that Vieri will not go on the transfer market despite vice - president Roberto Bettega ' s comment earlier this month that every player had his price .

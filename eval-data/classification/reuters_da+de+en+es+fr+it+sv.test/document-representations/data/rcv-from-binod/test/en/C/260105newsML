Boeing - MD merger raises stakes for European firms . Boeing ' s merger with McDonnell Douglas will be a blow for Airbus Industrie but should spur Europe towards consolidation in civil and military aerospace that its firms have yearned for , analysts said on Sunday . " The Americans have gone yet another stage towards consolidating their defence industry into just two or three major contractors , who now have the ability to compete very aggressively not only in third markets such as the Middle and Far East , but also in European markets , " said Nick Cunningham , industry analyst at investment bank BZW . " That is what the Europeans have really got to watch out for . " Members of the Airbus Industrie consortium are seeking to incorporate the four - member cooperative as well as to join their military businesses to get the critical mass they need to compete with the new U . S . industry titans . British Aerospace , as Europe ' s largest defence exporter , has made repeated calls for firms to come together to match the might of the U . S . combines hungry for foreign sales after heavy cuts in the U . S . defence budget . Relatively little has been achieved . Europe is waiting for France to privatise its predominantly state - owned industry to open the way for cross - border mergers . Difficulties over such fundamental issues as national pride were epitomised this month when the French government pulled the plug on the sale of defence electronics firm Thomson CSF to Lagardere Group after objections to Lagardere selling the rest of Thomson SA to Korea ' s Daiwoo . Aircraft manufacturers Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation are due to be merged but the process appears to be endless . " The Boeing - Douglas deal has a big message for the French which says let Lagardere get on with Thomson and make sure that Aerospatiale absorbs Dassualt quickly , " said Cunningham . In the civil aircraft industry the merger should not have any immediate impact on Airbus as McDonnell Douglas was already running a poor third to the Europeans in widebody jets . But analysts and industry executives say McDonnell Douglas gives Boeing extra capacity and expertise to get on with developing several new projects at once , which could leave Airbus trailing unless it can get on with its restructuring . Boeing and Airbus are racing to get multi - billion dollar plans for new 600 - seat superjumbo aircraft off their drawing boards while facing a backlog of demand for longer - range and larger versions of other aircraft in their existing ranges . " It should concentrate minds wonderfully at Airbus as to what their priorities are and to bringing in as many equity partners as possible to try and give them maximum resources , " said one analyst . Airbus has been seeking outside partners to help finance its project for the A3XX superjumbo and at the same time an outline agreement on its corporatisation plan was due to be agreed between the Airbus partners by the end of this year , with a view to completing incorporation before the end of the decade . The consortium is trying to determine what assets each partner should put in and what value should be put on them . Airbus comprises Germany ' Daimler Aerospace , Aerospatiale of France , British Aerospace and Spain ' s Construcciones Aeronauticas SA . It was agreed this month that Italian aerospace firm Alenia would also join in future projects .

ALPHATEC BONDHOLDERS TO RECONVENE IN SEPTEMBER . Eurobond holders of Thai electronics company Alphatec Electronics Plc decided to give the company another month to present restructuring plans , a company spokeswoman said on Thursday . " Bondholders ( on Wednesday ) voted to call another meeting on or around September 5 at which a final restructuring plan will be presented , " she said . Bond Trustee Bankers Trust called a bondholders meeting in Zurich on Wednesday after Alphatec failed to pay bond holders who exercised a put option on the firm ' s $ 45 million eurobond in June . Alphatec failed to present a restructuring plan to bondholders at the Wednesday meeting due to legal complications , the spokeswomen said . The firm has so far failed to arrange a legal indemnity for Price Waterhouse which performed an independent financial review of the company earlier this year . The review discovered 10 billion baht ( $ 323 million ) discrepancies in the company ' s books . The Alphatec board , which includes representatives from local bank creditors , is also split on the restructuring plan , the company ' s former Chief Financial Officer Leslie Merszei said in his resignation letter last week .

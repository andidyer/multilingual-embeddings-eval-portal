Clinton has " candid " exchange with Netanyahu . President Bill Clinton held " frank , candid " talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday , rebuffing his call for a U . S . - led Mideast summit while trying to revive stalled peace efforts . Tough talk by both Clinton and Netanyahu reflected the difficulties they face trying to keep an outbreak of violence over new Jewish housing in East Jerusalem from derailing the Israeli - Palestinian peace process . Using diplomatic jargon that usually suggests a strong clash of views and little progress , Clinton said after his two hours with Netanyahu that , " We had a very specific , frank , candid and long talk . " " Now we ' re going to talk to the Palestinians and see whether there ' s something we can do to get this thing going again , " Clinton said . White House officials said a Palestinian delegation was expected to visit the president later this week . At the start of the Oval Office talks , Clinton said Netanyahu ' s suggestion for U . S . - led Camp David - style talks was premature , while the Israeli leader made clear even before going to the White House that he would not reverse his decision to build new settlements . Israeli - Palestinian peace talks have ceased and violence has erupted nearly every day since Israel broke ground for new Jewish housing last month on Har Homa , a 6 , 500 - home project on a hilltop in East Jerusalem that Palestinians call Jabal Abu Ghneim and on land each side claims . " I think it is very important to get this peace process back on track , " Clinton told reporters assembled to witness the opening of the talks . " It ' s important that we not put form over substance , " he said , referring to Netanyahu ' s call for high - profile summitry brokered by Washington . " Its important to know where we ' re going and that ' s what I want to talk to ( Netanyahu ) about . " Netanyahu has proposed that he and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reach a final peace agreement within six months , and said the goal may require an intensive three - way summit like the one that led to accords between Egypt and Israel . The urgency of their meeting was underscored by yet more violence on the West Bank , where a Jewish settler shot and wounded at least two Palestinians during a stone - throwing incident on Monday . McCurry said Clinton " gave the prime minister some serious things to think about " during the meeting , which was hastily arranged as the Middle East peace process crumbled . But aides declined to discuss what those " serious things " might be , noting Clinton ' s observation to reporters that " the more I comment , the more I undermine the chances of success . " But administration officials have said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright might be sent to the region as a follow - up to Clinton ' s diplomatic efforts after the Palestinians talk with Clinton at the White House . Before his session with Clinton , Netanyahu generated thunderous applause from a pro - Israeli American group when he scornfully dismissed those who challenged " our right to build apartments " in mainly Arab East Jerusalem . Netanyahu scoffed at Palestinian condemnation of the project . " This simple act has been described as terrorism - - the terrorism of the walk - up rentals , the terrorism of the condominiums , " he said to laughter from a packed meeting room . The United States opposes all new Israeli settlements in the disputed territory , but has muted its public criticism in hopes of finding a way to defuse tensions .

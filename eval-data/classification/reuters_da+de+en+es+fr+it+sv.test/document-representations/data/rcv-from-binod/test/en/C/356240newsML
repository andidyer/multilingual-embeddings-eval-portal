Best of times for Intel stock behind it - Prudential . Intel Corp ' s spectacular performance both in terms of financial results and stock price appreciation since 1995 may prove difficult to repeat in upcoming years , Prudential analyst Mark Edelstone said . In comments detailing the move to cut his rating to hold from buy on the world ' s top computer chip maker , Edelstone wrote that , " We believe 1996 represented the Best of Times for Intel ' s fundamentals and performance of INTC ( the stock ) . " " But we expect risk factors to increase in 1997 and 1998 , " he said , noting how a historic confluence of strong PC demand , limited competition and the move to Pentium was now behind it . Traders said the Prudential analyst ' s pessimistic comments were behind a sharp selloff in Intel shares that had driven the stock down 8 - 1 / 4 to 157 - 1 / 4 by Wednesday afternoon . " Although we believe 1997 willl be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth , we believe Intel ' s level of earnings risk will increase significantly over last year , " he said . While noting that the company ' s product pipeline for 1997 includes the next generation of its Pentium Pro , code - named Klamath , and a new multimedia version of Pentium , he said he expected minimal software to be ready to harness such power . Edelstone cautioned that " the initial transition ( to MMX - based Pentiums ) could cause some hesitation among PC buyers during the next couple of quarters . " He said the forthcoming Klamath Pentium Pro chips offer " limited improvement in performance over the current Pentium Pro versions , ( which ) could lead to a slower - than - expected ramp once demand from early adopters has been satisfied . " While noting that the risks associated with product transitions are difficult to predict , agressive price cuts and the end of a cycle of manufacturing improvements may have caused Intel ' s gross profit margins to peak , the analyst said . This could cause near - term margin and earnings pressure , he said . Although the introduction of Advanced Micro Devices Inc ' s Pentium - rival K6 chip is unlikely to reduce Intel ' s market share in 1997 , Advanced Micro could force Intel to make price cuts and be in position to take meaningful share in 1998 , he said . " We believe investors should recognize that INTC ' s spectacular advance already discounts much of the strength in the company ' s fundamentals , " he wrote . " In fact , we believe 1997 may be a repeat of 1993 , when Intel ' s earnings more than doubled and the stock only advanced six percent , " he said . " At our $ 170 ( price target ) , we believe it is fairly valued , " Edelstone said . " We expect the stock to remain a market perfomer during the remainder of the year . " Edelstone ' s office said the analyst was traveling and not immediately available to comment . ( ( - - E . Auchard , Wall Street bureau , 212 - 859 - 1736 ) )

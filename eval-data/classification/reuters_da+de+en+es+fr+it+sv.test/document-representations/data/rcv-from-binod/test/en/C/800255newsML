FOCUS - Hanson charge hits H1 , upbeat outlook . Hanson Plc , now a building materials group after the former conglomerate ' s various demergers , reported first half pretax profits of 47 . 8 million pounds ( $ 75 . 8 million ) on Thursday , after taking a sting for over 49 million in charges . But the group said the outlook for the second half remained good , leading it to confirm a final dividend payout of eight pence per share after announcing an interim dividend of four pence . Underlying operating profits showed a rise of nine percent to 121 million , before charges , it said . Hanson , which inherited the name of the once - mighty conglomerate which completed a four - way demerger this year , said exceptional charges stemmed from writedowns in its stake in Australian mining firm RGC Ltd and its Goldfields investment plus losses on the sale of its electrical unit . Lord Hanson , the veteran chairman who is due to retire soon , said in a statement , " The rate of improvement in operating profit showed an increasing trend in the June quarter and Hanson is moving forward in accordance with its long term plan . " That plan consists of moving out of non - core , non performing sectors and concentrating on building materials . Andrew Dougal , chief executive , told a press briefing that despite a flattening out of growth in some British businesses , he remained upbeat . " I am very optimistic indeed for the outlook of our operating divisions . " But the market remained sceptical , with the shares falling 10 pence to 318 1 / 2 . " Hanson always tries to sound optimistic , but the market never believes them , " said one dealer . The results did not top forecasts and some players saw the figures as a chance to cash in their spoils . " It ' s profit taking , they have had a great run , " concluded one market maker . Chris Collins , deputy chairman and the man annointed to take over from Lord Hanson , said the group would be focusing on expansion this year , with the booming U . S . market likely to provide the best deals . " The main expansion over the next 12 months will be in the U . S . We particularly see scope for expanding Cornerstone ( the aggregates to construction division ) . " He added that plans to sell U . S . hydraulic equipment unit Grove Worldwide were proceeding . Hanson is continuing to have talks with a number of potential buyers , he said . Dougal blamed the recent slowdown in some domestic divisions on bad weather which delayed projects and the holiday slowdown . But despite the overall optimism Hanson did warn that the British government ' s cancellation of some road building projects had damaged its aggregates company ARC . Dougal said , " It will effect ARC and as a result conditions in this sector remain challenging . " He said that government cuts in road spending only stored up safety and economic problems for the future as traffic continued to grow . Looking at a divisional breakdown of the results , ARC sales fell to 255 million pounds from 268 million , with profits up to 45 . 4 million versus 42 . 8 million . Cornerstone saw sales rise to 465 million pounds from 446 million , with profits at 26 . 9 million versus 21 . 7 million . Hanson Brick , the second biggest brick - maker in Britain , had sales of 106 million versus 111 million , with profits up to 20 . 7 million from 17 . 5 million . Grove Worldwide sales were 271 million versus 279 million , with profits of 25 . 3 million , down from 28 . 8 million . Associated companies turned in 7 . 3 million in additional profit . This mainly comprises of Hanson ' s stake in Australian gold mining company RGC Ltd , which the group hopes to sell in future . " Our stake in RGC is not long term . . . But now is not the time to sell , " said Collins . ( $ = 0 . 630 British Pounds )

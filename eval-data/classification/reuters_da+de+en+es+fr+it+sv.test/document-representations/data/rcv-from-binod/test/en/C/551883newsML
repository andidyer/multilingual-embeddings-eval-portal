Imation sees 1997 revenue growth difficult . Imation Corp said it may be difficult to increase revenues in 1997 due to the strong dollar , which reduced first - quarter revenues by 3 . 5 percent and earnings per share by $ 0 . 17 , as compared with the first quarter of 1996 . The company on Wednesday reported first - quarter revenues of $ 547 . 7 million with net income of $ 12 million , versus revenues of $ 576 . 1 million and net income of $ 6 . 1 a year ago . About half the revenue decline was due to a decision to exit certain underperforming businesses , Imation said . " We are progressing towards our three year financial goal of $ 150 million improvement in economic profit between 1996 and 1998 . However , the recent strengthening of the dollar makes the achievement of revenue growth difficult this year , " said chief executive Bill Monahan . " We showed strong growth in both Asia and Latin America on a local currency basis during the quarter . Europe was soft this quarter , compared with a very strong first quarter last year . " Gross margins improved to 36 . 3 percent compared with 35 . 1 percent in the first quarter of last year , the company said . The company ' s effective tax rate of 45 percent improved by three percentage points compared with the last half of 1996 .

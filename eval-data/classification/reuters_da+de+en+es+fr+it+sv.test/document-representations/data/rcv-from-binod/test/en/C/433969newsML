PVF Pensions , Rabo call off cooperation . Unlisted Dutch pension management group PVF Pensioenen said on Tuesday it had ended exploratory talks on commercial cooperation with cooperative Rabobank Nederland which were announced last November . " PVF Pensioenen has insufficiently been able to assess which advantages would have been created for its clients through a close cooperation with Rabobank Nederland , " PVF said in a statement . It said it had looked at jointly entering the market for large companies ' pension funds and at cooperating with Rabobank ' s insurance unit Interpolis on employee benefits . " Although an agreement ( on cooperation ) would have been possible , an undesirable situation would have been created where mutual competition in the same market segment would remain , " PVF said . It added it would look at other opportunities to strengthen its position in the coming months . PVF manages 90 pension funds on behalf of large companies and industry sectors . It has total assets under its management of more than 45 billion guilders . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

Argentine mayor bans gays from " love motels " . An Argentine town has banned gays from using pay - by - the - hour " love motels " for amorous encounters by ruling that all couples admitted must be " without exception a man and a woman . " But the mayor of Malvinas Argentinas , a small blue - collar town on the outskirts of Buenos Aires , on Monday denied charges of discrimination leveled by angry gay and lesbian groups . " We would be discriminating if in this new by - law we had specified that fat people can ' t use them , or that preferably only blondes with blue eyes should go there , " Mayor Jesus Cariglino told reporters . " Love - motels " , known by euphemisms such as " transitory hostels " or " lodging hotels , " are a popular refuge for young Argentine couples who still live with their parents or older couples with something to hide .

FEATURE - Moko face tattooing part of Maori renaissance . Ta Moko , the Maori tradition of face tattooing , is undergoing a renaissance as part of a wider cultural revival and assertion of sovereignty . The revival is seen by some as a divisive issue between whites and Maori as well as between Maori and Maori . Some see it as a chilling threat , a hark back to the Maori ' s savage past . It is an integral part of the Maori warrior persona and a potent symbol of rebellion - - a rejection of Western domination . But many Maori today put the revival into the context of Maori spirituality , language rebirth and growing confidence in identity for New Zealand ' s half million Maori . " This is the direction to Maori freedom , self - determination and sovereignty , " said Tame Iti , his own face adorned with the distinctive swirling Maori designs of his tribe and family . " It is how we , as Maori , can revive and express our view of the right to self determination , " Iti said in a recent Television New Zealand documentary , " About Face " . " It is not designed to scare people , but to enlighten . " In the 18th century , travellers and settlers from Captain Cook onwards expressed admiration at the painfully acquired and elaborate adornment on the faces of Maori men of rank , as well as on the chins and lips of Maori women . They had seen similar tattooing in other Polynesian islands , too , and heard the word moko widely used across many Pacific languages to mean " lizard " as well as " tattoo " . SYMBOLS OF REBELLIONMoko became symbols of rebellion during the 19th Century Maori - settler wars but died out by the early 20th Century as European culture asserted its dominance and large numbers of Maori converted to Christianity , and also thanks to a ban via the Tohunga Suppression Act of 1906 . Rare instances of moko tattooing occurred in the 1920s , but it was as part of the raising of Maori consciousness that began in the 1970s that the modern movement became rooted . Pioneers include Maori - dominated gangs , outcasts of society , and others who used art as a vehicle to reassert Maori identity . Moko expert Pouroto Ngaropo said it was no longer primarily to affront European culture , but a positive affirmation . " It is just going to become a natural part of the process of becoming ourselves again , " he said . Chris Natana , who with his wife Taukiri Natana underwent the painful tatooing in front of the television cameras , said the young couple had not taken the moko as a protest . " For me , it shows who you are , what culture you are and what you believe in , " said Natana , who breeds pit bull terriers . " It ' s not what ' s on the outside . It ' s what ' s on the inside that counts , " he said . " You can ' t just take the picture on the face and say ' that ' s a mean man ' . " Taukiri Natana took her moko against her father ' s wishes . Moko tatooist Rangi Skipper said he often meets Maori who disapprove and pakeha ( whites ) who don ' t understand . " They see that as the confrontational face - - the visual representation of Maori resistance , " he said . Skipper uses the modern tatooists ' tools of electric needles , but is studying the traditional technique of carving and grooving the moko with fine albatross bone chisels . APPEARANCE DISTRACTS PEOPLETe Kaha Karoitiana , who underwent moko more than a year ago said he doesn ' t notice it any more , but he has seen people so distracted by his appearance they have walked into doors . Some of the most adverse reactions have come from within his family , and Skipper said some Maori believe the moko should be abandoned . " If that ' s the case , we shouldn ' t be speaking Te Reo Maori ( the Maori spoken language ) , " he added . Who is allowed to undergo moko is also controversial . Iti said anyone has the right to take the moko as long as they understand its responsibilities . " If people get it for the right reasons and they are going to wear it in the right manner , then it is a good thing , " said Ben Dalton , who has had his thighs and buttocks tatooed . " But then if it comes like a fad or if it becomes the latest fashion accessory , it is going to be a bit of a problem , " he said . " It has to have some meaning to it . " While the use of moko as a fashion accessory is disapproved of , acceptance of mokoed Maori in the bastions of European culture is anticipated and welcomed . " We believe moko will take its place in society such as lawyers , such as members of parliament , such as accountants , " said Ngaropo . Member of Parliament Alamein Kopu said she would one day get a moko , while the deputy leader of her Alliance Party , Sandra Lee , also Maori , said she was still thinking about it . " I ' m not rushing . I ' m still partial to my lipstick , " Lee said .

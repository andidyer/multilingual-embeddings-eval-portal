United Airlines changes flyer bonus plan . United Airlines , the operating unit of UAL Corp , said Monday it was altering its frequent flyer program by linking upgrades to ticket revenue as opposed to miles flown . This modification recognizes as United ' s best customers those who are giving the airline the most revenue , United said in a news release . The changes , geared toward maintaining the economic feasibility and longevity of United ' s Mileage Plus program , will allow passengers paying full fare to receive higher priority in obtaining upgrades beginning January 1 , 1998 , United said . Changes going into effect January 1 , 1997 , will allow miles on flown on all of United ' s marketing alliance partners to count toward the status a flyer has under United ' s plan . As of January 1 , 1998 , passengers using United ' s Saver awards will need to book at least 14 days in advance and stay over on a Saturday evening , putting these awards in line with a discount ticket , United said . Saver awards require fewer miles than Premium awards . Also complimentary upgrades will be sent to Premier members based on revenue spent with the airline . United said the number of miles needed to achieve upgrades and free trips will not change under the revised plan . - - Reuters Chicago newsdesk , 312 - 408 - 8787

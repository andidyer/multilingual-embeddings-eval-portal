TENNIS - DEDICATED FANS HEAD FOR PEOPLE ' S SUNDAY AT WIMBLEDON . Eager tennis fans were Wimbledon - bound after tennis officials announced they would open the courts for a repeat of 1991 ' s " People ' s Sunday . " Armed with sleeping bags , tents , air beds and camping stoves , enthusiasts flocked to claim their place at the front of the line for one of the 21 , 000 centre court and number one court tickets up for grabs for only the second time in history . Some had been queuing since Saturday morning , hoping for tickets for Monday ' s play , but the prospect of prime seats on Sunday was a welcome gift . " It ' s such a bonus , " said Alan Brackett of Canvey Island in Essex , south east England . " As long as it doesn ' t rain , " he added ominously . True tennis lovers among the general public were grateful to the abysmal weather which forced the tournament organisers to offer tickets for the two main show courts at 15 pounds ( $ 25 ) each and 6 , 500 ground passes at five pounds each . " This is what the tennis fans want . If you ' ve never had a centre court ticket , it ' s a great opportunity , " said Sheila Dixon from LincolnshireMany , like 61 - year - old Vivian Buckland from Buckinghamshire , are veterans . Buckland has camped out religiously for the last 10 years . " It ' s exciting . It adds to the atmosphere , " she said , revealing that one of her many bags contained white wine and port " to help me sleep . " But her dedication couldn ' t match that of local Nicola Wiseman , who has queued every year for tickets since 1981 . " I love tennis . This is my 17th year . I first came to see ( Ilie ) Nastase , " she said . Irene Clark from Hertfordshire , who is camping out here for the sixth time , said proudly : " We progress a little every year . We get a little more clued up . When we first came we didn ' t even have an air bed . We slept on the pavement . Now we ' ve got a stove and a little table . " But Moira Dixon , who had packed her bags last night on the off - chance the courts would open on Sunday , had different priorities . " I don ' t have a tent , but I ' ve brought my dress , " she laughed , pointing to flowered fabric wrapped in a bag hanging from a branch . " Well , I can ' t go on centre court in my sloppy trousers , can I ? "

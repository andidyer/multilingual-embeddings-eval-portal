Ford working on small sport utility vehicle . Ford Motor Co . , anxious to keep its momentum in the popular sport utility segment , is developing a subcompact car for that market and may boost first - quarter production for the Explorer , company executives said Wednesday . At a press briefing Ford Chairman Alex Trotman declined to say when the new mini - sport utility vehicle would be brought to market . " It ' s on the burner , and I expect we will have at some point in the not - too - distant future a sub - Explorer utility type vehicle , " he said . Industry sources have said Ford may introduce the vehicle in February or March of 1999 . Current plans call for it to be a Mazda - based vehicle similar in size to RAV4 from Toyota Motor Corp . and CR - V from Honda Motor Co . Ltd . that would be built at Ford ' s St . Louis , Mo . assembly facility . Ford Division General Manager Ross Roberts said the automaker wanted to bring the vehicle to market as soon as possible , and might accelerate its introduction . He said a decision has been made on a manufacturing plant , but declined to disclose the location . Commenting on the Explorer , Roberts said Ford was reviewing whether to schedule overtime to increase production during the first quarter of 1997 . Explorer sales for the first 11 months of 1996 were 369 , 491 , and Roberts predicted Ford would sell more than 400 , 000 this year . Ford sold 395 , 227 Explorers in 1995 , making it the third best - selling vehicle in the United States . Trotman also said that Ford expected total 1996 revenues of $ 150 billion , up from $ 137 . 1 billion in 1995 . He painted an upbeat picture for Ford in 1997 as the automaker breaks out from under a record number of new product launches around the world that have hampered results this year . Ford expects improving results in 1997 from its European and Brazilian operations , which lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 1996 due to competitive pressures and higher - than - expected start - up costs , respectively . In the United States , Trotman said Ford will continue to work on driving costs down and improving per - vehicle profitabitly - - two areas where Ford has lagged its domestic rivals in the past . Ford ' s U . S . market share slipped to 25 . 3 percent for the first 11 months of 1996 from 26 percent a year ago , according to Autodata Corp . But Trotman said improving that number was not the top priority for Ford in 1997 . " The goal is to run a balanced business , " he said . Trotman sounded several cautionary notes . With worldwide new vehicle sales forecast at 52 million units for 1997 and global capacity at 65 million to 70 million units , automakers around the world are grappling to stay profitable . The market in Europe is particularly tough , Trotman said , and Ford was considering reducing some of its capacity there , although he declined to discuss specifics . In the United States , Ford predicted total vehicle sales will be flat with the expected 15 . 4 million for 1996 . Western Europe was also likely to see flat sales in 1997 compared to the 14 . 2 million units seen for this year . The biggest growth from now until 2005 will come in South America and Asia Pacific regions , Trotman said . Those two regions are forecast to capture a combined global market share of 35 percent by then , nearly double from the 19 percent they currently have . By contrast , North America and Europe will fall off to 50 percent of the world wide market by 2005 from 65 percent now , Ford predicts .

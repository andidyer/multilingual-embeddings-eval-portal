SOCCER - KLINSMANN UNLIKELY TO TAKE UP EVERTON OFFER . Juergen Klinsmann ' s return to the English premier league is far from certain despite British newspaper reports that he is set to rejoin Tottenham at the end of the season , sources close to the player said on Tuesday . The Germany captain , who has decided to leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season because he is unhappy with the way he has been treated at the club , has had offers to play in Spain , Italy and Turkey as well as England . Although Klinsmann is attracted by a return to Tottenham , where he was very successful two seasons ago , he may still be lured back to Italy where he used to play for Internazionale Milan . Ailing English premier league side Everton , who were reported to be having talks with Klinsmann this week , have a big task on their hands to get his signature . " There are offers from Italy and England but it is not clear where he is going yet , " the sources said . " Tottenham cannot be ruled out . I think Juergen is more likely to take up an offer from a London club ( than Everton ) . " Klinsmann , who recently became a father for the first time , said he would not announce his decision until the German season finished at the end of this month . Bayern said he had not made up his mind yet about his future . Klinsmann has said his priorities at the moment were with his family and helping Bayern win the German title . He left London club Tottenham amid considerable acrimony with chairman Alan Sugar after just one season . But Klinsmann has settled his differences with Sugar , the sources said . Some Munich football followers believe , however , that Klinsmann is more likely to return to Italy than England . He has a house near Milan and his wife is believed to like the area .

IPE natgas ticks up in Q1 in late trade , May rolls . IPE natural gas futures eventually responded to recent rises on the OTC market by climbing in the first quarter of 1998 on Tuesday afternoon , brokers said . But the winter deals were only done in the last quarter of an hour before the market closed . Until then , the only trade seen had been in front month May at lower prices . The May contract expires at the end of the Tuesday trading session . But trade there was thin , with only 25 lots done in four deals . It was not until the end of the session that recent strength on the OTC market filtered through to futures , with January rising 0 . 145 pence to 17 . 35 pence a therm , February up 0 . 25 pence to 17 . 60 pence , and March up 0 . 22 to 14 . 245 pence . But only one trade was done in each month . A total of 80 lots were traded , higher than on Monday but still disappointing in comparison with recent high volumes on the physical market . - - London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 6412

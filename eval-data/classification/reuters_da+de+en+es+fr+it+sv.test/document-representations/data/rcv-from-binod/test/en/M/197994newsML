EMERGING MARKET OUTLOOK - Russia , Brazil / Czech polls . Russia will take centre stage once again this week as investors watch for details of its landmark Eurobond , while elections in the Czech Republic and Brazil will bear strongly the equity markets in both nations . But it is fixed income investors in particular who will be watching RUSSIA for firmer indications of the pricing of its debut Eurobond , likely to be a $ 500 million three to five - year issue due at the end of November . " Russia really is the market that has captured everybody ' s attention , " said one London - based emerging market fund manager . News from the London leg of an international roadshow , attended by Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits , lifted the price of Russian MinFin bonds last week . Although the presentations move this week to the United States and wind up in New York on November 20 , market players are already talking of a yield spread between 300 and 335 basis points over U . S . Treasuries , down sharply from around 400 b . p . over a week ago . Two days later debate will start in the Duma over Russia ' s 1997 budget , and horsetrading for support will carry on in earnest beforehand . Russia - watchers will also be eager for news on whether the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has decided to release the delayed tranche of a $ 10 billion loan , pending IMF satisfaction with Russia ' s efforts on tax collection . But some analysts are optimistic . " A decision on whether or not to release the suspended disbursement is expected in about a week - - the prospects look good , " ANZ emerging market analysts said . " Russian assets now appear to have all the ingredients necessary for further gains . . . an assault on the Vnesh ' s previous high of 82 is just around the corner , " they said . BULGARIA meanwhile will continue its knife - edge performance , teetering on the edge of default amid the on - going absence of IMF help . The Fund ' s proposal for a currency board to restore faith in the lev has won grudging support from Bulgaria ' s opposition as well as its ruling Socialist Party . But last week the lev slipped to all - time lows as ordinary Bulgarians lost confidence in the currency and converted their savings to dollars . The CZECH REPUBLIC meanwhile held first round senate elections on the weekend and investors are hoping the vote will reduce the pressure on the country ' s stock market . They fear a minority showing for the ruling centre - right coalition in the senate , after its weak result in lower house elections in June , will hit investor confidence . Early results suggested a stronger showing for Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus ' s rightwing Civic Democratic Party despite a thin voter turnout . In ROMANIA , president - elect Emil Constantinescu , savouring a historic triumph over ex - communists who held the country in an iron grip , said on Monday he would move swiftly to begin a new era of reform . Constantinescu won Sunday ' s election by a surprisingly large margin , defeating Ion Iliescu who led Romania since its bloody upheaval in 1989 , and until recently was favourite to win again . Exit polls gave Constantinescu a seven or eight point margin over Iliescu , MOLDOVA too went to the polls for its first multi - party presidential election on Sunday . Preliminary results suggested President Mircea Snegur was well ahead of his eight rivals . But if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote , a pre - Christmas run - off will be held between the two top contenders on December 1 . Attention in Latin America meanwhile will focus mainly on BRAZIL after the country posted a monster $ 1 . 3 billion trade deficit for October that was even worse than the $ 1 . 0 billion anticipated . While seasonal factors and high oil prices have weighed in this month ' s data , investors are disappointed by that number and the prospect of a 4 . 0 percent operational deficit , rather than the forecast 3 . 0 percent . " After the Mexican crisis people have been watching these two figures , " said Mohamed Mourabet , Brazil investment analyst at Fleming Investment Management . " Two years ago they would have appeared normal by emerging market standards . " Meanwhile results from the second round of Brazil ' s municipal elections , held on Friday , come out this week , and investors hope this will end the intra - election dolldrums that have flattened its markets since the first round on October 18 . Mourabet said many players were looking at the prospect of a cabinet reshuffle in December or January , and who takes what position will be decided partly in light of the poll ' s outcome . VENEZUELA ' s telecom firm CANTV meanwhile goes under the hammer in an international public offering on November 21 when the government sells most of its 49 percent stake . Last Thursday Venezuela ' s National Investment Fund said buy orders had topped $ 890 million . In Asia , investors are keeping anxious watch on the result of elections in THAILAND , described as the dirtiest and most violent for years . " With Thailand facing a crisis of confidence from foreign investors , whoever heads a new coalition will have to move fast to demonstrate that they have clear policies on the economy and the financial sector , " Foreign & Colonial emerging markets said . " The results of the elections . . . are vital to the near - term health of the economy and stockmarket . " And the risk of an interest rate cut to deter foreign capital inflows may be growing in INDONESIA which is experiencing strong money supply growth . " With Bank Indonesia increasingly resorting to direct controls to curb bank lending , the time may be approaching when interest rates can be cut to try to contain this foreign inflow , " Foreign & Colonial emerging markets added . The IFC emerging market composite investable index , IFC / IPRD , denominated in dollars , was up 0 . 3 percent week on week at 293 . 09 points on Friday . Latin America and Asia were both up 0 . 6 percent week on week , at 531 . 21 and 525 . 36 respectively , while Europe , Middle East and Africa were down 0 . 8 at 133 . 25 . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 2734

Tax rule may bring savings to U . S . companies in HK . A tax ruling by the U . S . Treasury Department before Hong Kong ' s return to Chinese sovereignty could trim taxes that U . S . companies pay for their Hong Kong subsidiaries , tax experts here said . The ruling - - whether to treat Hong Kong and China as one country or to continue to separate them for tax purposes - - is due before Hong Kong ' s transfer on July 1 . Industry groups have been lobbying the government to treat Hong Kong and China as " one country , " which experts said would result in lower U . S . taxes on companies for their Hong Kong subsidiaries . " In view of the uncertainty , U . S . multinationals should consider both scenarios - - one that the status quo will remain ( two countries ) and , secondly , the possibility that one - country tax treatment might be possible , " three tax experts at Coopers and Lybrand said in an article to be published in the Tax Management International Journal , Stanley Sherwood , an international tax partner responsible for the Coopers and Lybrand China Tax Desk and lead author of the article , told Reuters that U . S . multinational companies in general would like to see Hong Kong and China treated as one country . Because of Hong Kong ' s low tax rate of 16 . 5 percent , income of Hong Kong subsidiaries of U . S . companies must be taxed in some cases on a current basis as part of the " anti - avoidance " rule designed to plug the holes created by U . S . tax - haven seekers . If Hong Kong is considered part of China for U . S . tax purposes , the " anti - avoidance " rules would not be applicable and therefore some income would not be immediately taxable . " If Hong Kong is treated as part of China , many of the anti - avoidance rules would go away , " he said . While tax policy - making is in the domain of the Treasury Department , the State Department wields considerable influence in formulating this politically sensitive " one country " treatment , Sherwood noted . Hong Kong does not have any double income tax treaties , and the 1984 Income Tax Treaty between the U . S . and China would not apply to Hong Kong after the transfer . Any change in the tax treatment of U . S . multinationals with affilates in Hong Kong would be a U . S . internal tax decision , Sherwood said . " It ' s going to be disruptive from the tax point of view ( if the change takes place ) , but it does not deal with other relationships that the U . S . government has ( with China ) , " he said .

Manila checking on Filipinos on Saudi death row . The Philippines ' vice president said on Wednesday he will discuss the fate of Filipinos on death row in Saudi Arabia when he visits Riyadh this week and seek an audience with the king about jailed Filipino protesters . Official sources said 33 Filipinos were awaiting execution by the sword in the conservative kingdom , most of them for murder and drugs charges . " I will be looking into the cases ( of Filipinos on death row ) , " Vice President Joseph Estrada told Reuters during an official visit to the United Arab Emirates . " Being the number two man in my country , it is my duty to help my countrymen . " The sources said 16 other Filipinos were arrested in the Saudi capital Riyadh last month after a protest in front of the Philippines embassy . The demonstrators accused the embassy of granting insufficient support to the 500 , 000 Filipinos living and working in the kingdom , the official sources said . " I hope to have an audience with King Fahd to ask for him for an amnesty for those who have committed only minor crimes , " he said , adding some the protestors may have previously broken the law . Estrada , who is due to arrive in Riyadh later on Wednesday , is on an official tour of the Gulf region . He is scheduled to stay in the kingdom for three days before continuing to Bahrain . " I am hopeful because our relationship with Saudi Arabia is very good , " he said . Philippines officials said some of the protesters were among hundreds of Filipinos stranded in the kingdom who could not afford to return home because they quit jobs with local employers before their contracts expired . They said many left their employers complaining of poor treatment , physical and verbal harassment and non - payment of salaries . About four million Filipinos work overseas - - about one million of them in the Gulf - - in hopes of making more money than they can at home . In addition to the half a million Filipinos in Saudi Arabia , about 100 , 000 work in Kuwait , 80 , 000 in the United Arab Emirates and 40 , 000 in Bahrain . Reli German , Estrada ' s communications director , said Filipinos were also stranded in the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia ' s neighbour to the east . A UAE amnesty for illegal foreign workers expired on November 1 , but diplomats say many of the unlawful workers remain . During Estrada ' s stay in the United Arab Emirates , he granted six stranded couples tickets to return home . " One of them was a couple with a seven - month - old baby . The wife left her employer because she said he had maltreated her , " one official said . " Another woman escaped from her employer after he hadn ' t paid her wages for seven months .

RUGBY UNION - LUYT SAYS ALL BLACKS " WORST LOSERS " . Louis Luyt , controversial president of the South African Rugby Football Union ( SARFU ) , refueled his personal war of words with New Zealand in a rare television interview on Tuesday . Luyt caused the All Blacks to storm out of the 1995 World Cup banquet by claiming that South Africa would also have won the tournament in 1987 and 1991 . " I didn ' t say anything wrong as far as I ' m concerned , " the interview - shy Luyt told satellite television viewers in South Africa . " Dr Craven ( SARFU ' s previous president ) first went on record in 1987 saying the All Blacks could not call themselves world champions without the Cavaliers who were then banned . And in 1991 we were not there either . " The victorious Springbok ' s late arrival at the dinner as well as Luyt ' s presentation of a watch to Welshman Derek Bevan who had refereed South Africa ' s contentious semi - final with France also angered guests . Luyt said : " The Springboks arrived one and half hours late ( for the dinner ) . During that time Colin Meades ( the All Black manager ) came up to the table and gave me an ear bashing . " He asked in very strong language where the Springboks were . He said ' we would have been here at seven had we won ' . I said , ' yes , but you didn ' t win ' and he nearly hit me - - that made me believe they are really bad losers . " New Zealand ' s World Cup coach Laurie Mains has since claimed that his team were poisoned by a waitress named Susie before losing the final 15 - 12 . Mains said he knew who had paid her to doctor the All Blacks ' food but declined to name him . John Hart , who coached New Zealand to their first series win in South Africa ( 2 - 1 ) last season , also complained that his party had been treated with " disdain " by SARFU during their tour . SARFU strongly denied the charge and accused Hart of whingeing .

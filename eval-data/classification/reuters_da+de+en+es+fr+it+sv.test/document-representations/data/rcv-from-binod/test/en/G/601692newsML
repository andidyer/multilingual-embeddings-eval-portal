Thousands of Mexican teachers march to protest pay . More than 30 , 000 teachers marched to demand a bigger pay rise on Wednesday , snarling traffic and paralysing the capital ' s congested centre . Teachers from at least four states paraded down two of Mexico City ' s main avenues to press their demands but 2 , 500 riot police wielding clubs and shields massed to prevent them from approaching Los Pinos , the official residence of President Ernesto Zedillo . The marchers chanted anti - Zedillo slogans , but early reports said there appeared to be no sign of the violent clashes that occured during a teachers ' protest on May 15 . " Our six percent pay rise was ridiculous , all it will give us is 3 . 7 pesos ( 47 cents ) a day more , " said Martin Garcia , a young teacher from the poor southern state of Oaxaca . The march was the second big protest since the government announced a special six percent rise in salary and a 10 percent rise in benefits for the teachers , who are traditionally poorly paid here . Inflation is currently running at about 22 percent a year . The latest teachers ' pay hike came on top of a rise of 17 percent awarded in January .

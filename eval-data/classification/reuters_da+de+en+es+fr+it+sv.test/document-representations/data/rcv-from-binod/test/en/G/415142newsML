Albania imposes emergency , curfew , press curbs . Albania ' s beleaguered government issued orders to shoot armed rioters on sight , imposed a dusk - to - dawn curfew and curbed press freedoms on Monday in an effort to smother violent unrest sweeping Europe ' s poorest country . Giant Chinook helicopters sent by Italy plucked foreigners from the southern Albania Mediterranean port town of Vlore , set ablaze and plundered by armed mobs of Albanians enraged by the loss of their savings . Weeks of unrest sparked by the collapse of fraudulent pyramid schemes climaxed this weekend when at least 12 people were killed after crowds in several southern towns raided weapons depots and went on a rampage of burning and looting . In the capital Tirana , parliament elected President Sali Berisha to a second five - year term a day after it voted unanimously to declare an emergency in response to the violence . The deputies issued a deadline of 2 p . m . ( 1300 GMT ) on Monday for " armed rebels " to surrender their weapons or security forces would shoot them without warning . Albanian state television said police had been given powers to shoot stone - throwers on sight and arrest anyone not in possession of valid identity papers in the mainly Moslem nation . It said a nationwide curfew would be in force between 8 p . m . ( 1900 GMT ) and 7 a . m . ( 0600 GMT ) . In Vienna , a spokesman for Berisha dismissed the unrest as the work of criminals intent on toppling the government . " This is a rebellion of ordinary and political criminals who are trying to topple the legitimate power , " Genc Pollo , a member of parliament for the ruling Democratic Party and Berisha ' s spokesman , told Austrian state radio . Berisha himself blamed " communist rebels helped and financed by foreign espionage services " for the violence and vowed to use the " iron hand " of the law to quash the uprising . Italian military helicopters evacuated 35 foreigners , including 20 Italians , from the southern port of Vlore , the foreign ministry said . In Rome , the head of the ministry ' s crisis unit said the foreigners , who included 10 reporters , had arrived at the southern Italian port of Brindisi . Vincenzo Petrone said among the people evacuated were four Germans , one Dutch citizen and at least three Greek nationals . Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi held over an hour of talks on the Albanian crisis with Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini , Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta and Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano . " From the meeting emerged a common concern about the political situation , public order and finances in the country , " a statement from Prodi ' s office said . It added that international institutions should organise financial aid for Albania , Europe ' s poorest country . In Athens , deputy foreign minister Yiannos Kranidiotis said the Greek army was watching the border with Albania closely in case of a mass exodus of people fleeing the violence . " There is a concern that there might be some mass movement . We are watching the situation so we can deal with such an event if it occurs , " he said . The foreign , defence and public order ( police ) ministries were in constant contact and " the army is keeping a close watch on the frontier with Albania " , he said . The Council of Europe ' s parliamentary assembly urged an immediate end to the violence . " This crisis has to be resolved in a peaceful manner , by democratic means and through democratic institutions , " parliamentary assembly president Leni Fischer said in a statement in Strasbourg . Europe ' s top security body , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , said it too was closely monitoring the situation . Curbs on the media came into force at midnight GMT and were promptly condemned by the International Press Institute . " The IPI strongly condemns the introduction by Albania ' s parliament of controls on the media , " the Vienna - based group of editors and publishers representing media in 88 countries said in an open letter to Berihsa .

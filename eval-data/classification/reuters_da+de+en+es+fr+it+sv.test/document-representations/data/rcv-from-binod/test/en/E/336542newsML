Four million of China state firm workers jobless . Almost half of China ' s 70 , 000 industrial state enterprises ended 1996 in the red despite layoffs of about four million workers due to production cuts and bankruptcies , a senior government statistician said on Monday . More than 30 , 000 industrial state enterprises - - or 43 . 7 percent of the total - - posted losses in 1996 , up five percentage points from the previous year , Qiu Xiaohua , spokesman for the State Statistical Bureau , told a news conference . Their combined losses climbed 20 percent in 1996 to 61 . 6 billion yuan ( $ 7 . 4 billion ) from 1995 , Qiu said . " The losses of some enterprises are outstanding , " he said . Qiu blamed the mounting losses on " blind " investment , or excessive investment in industries that appear to be profitable and which is leading to cut - throat competition , monopolies and local protectionism . For example , all but one of China ' s 30 provinces and municipalities are turning out television sets while 23 regions have plunged into manufacturing cars , refrigerators and washing machines resulting in saturation , he said . The government has vowed to curb such " blind " investment , which has resulted in goods stockpiled in warehouses , ranging from shirts to bicycles and wristwatches . Funds of state enterprises tied up in excessive stockpiles totalled 150 billion yuan ( $ 18 . 1 billion ) at the end of last year , Qiu said . " The problem of goods piling up and debts owed to each other has not turned for the better , " Qiu said . " Costs are higher . . . due to excessive competition . " Qui said four million state enterprise workers , or about five percent of the total , were now out of work . Chinese sources say the figure is much bigger , with 27 percent of such labourers laid off or still on the payroll but taking a huge pay cut . The government has been reluctant to push many of its loss - making state enterprises into bankruptcy due to fears of mass unemployment and social unrest . Economic tsar Zhu Rongji has called for further mergers of lumbering state enterprises and fewer bankruptcies . Qiu insisted state enterprises were starting to see a dramatic turnaround . The losses of state enterprises rose by 50 . 8 percent in the first half but the rate of increase slowed to 27 . 1 percent for the July - November period and to only 12 percent in the fourth quarter , Qiu said . Qiu forecast the number of loss - making state enterprises would shrink to less than 30 percent of the total this year from 43 . 7 percent last year . Profits of state firms plunged 88 percent in the first half of 1996 , but fell only 20 percent in the second half and even jumped 14 percent in the fourth quarter , he said . Sales were up and stockpiles down , he said , adding that bank deposits of state enterprises rose by 140 billion yuan ( $ 16 . 9 billion ) in 1996 to 502 . 6 billion yuan ( $ 60 . 6 billion ) compared with 1995 . Qiu attributed the recovery to two interest rate cuts last year . The cuts reduced interest payments of state enterprises by 70 billion yuan ( $ 8 . 4 billion ) a year , he said . ( $ 1 = 8 . 3 yuan )

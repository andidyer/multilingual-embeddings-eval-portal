RTRS - GMA sees profitability in 1996 / 97 . Gold Mines of Australia Ltd ( GMA ) said on Wednesday it is well placed to return to profitability in the year to June 30 , 1997 after it reported a net loss of A $ 16 . 15 million for the 1995 / 96 year . " Directors believe the company is now well placed to return to profitability in 1996 / 97 as development and operating costs at its major operations fall and production improves , " GMA said in a statement accompanying its 1995 / 96 annual results . GMA said it was disappointed with its 1995 / 96 result . Steps have been taken to maximise productivity and reduce unit operating costs at all company sites , including management reorganisation and a greater emphasis on profit generation from all operations , GMA said . It said it expected an improved performance from its mines , the Mount Lyell copper / gold project in Tasmania , the Reedy and Youanmi gold projects , both in Western Australia . The miner said the 1995 / 96 result was affected by an abnormal A $ 25 million write - off of exploration and development costs at Youanmi . GMA said Youanmi is now carried in its accounts at a value , which will result in future amortisation charges being reduced . " The operation ( Youanmi ) is now positioned to make a positive contribution to group profits during 1996 / 97 , " it said . It said the A $ 25 million abnormal loss was partially offset by a A $ 19 . 7 million abnormal profit resulting from the close - out of currency hedging contracts and gold forward contracts . Since then , GMA has entered into longer dated gold hedging and will continue this policy as opportunities arise , it said . Copper hedging contracts remain in place , the miner said . At 12 . 55 p . m . ( 0255 GMT ) , GMA shares were steady at 21 . 5 cents . - - Sydney newsroom 61 - 2 9373 1800

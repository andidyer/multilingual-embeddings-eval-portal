Wet Brent firms on Iraq and market manoeuvres . Short - term tightness and uncertainty over the destination of Brent cargoes in the hands of a major lifted the wet market and firmed cash crude on Monday , traders said . Concern over new U . N . Security Council threats of sanctions against Iraq firmed outright values , with IPE August futures up 29 cents to $ 17 . 94 a barrel at 1215 GMT but North Sea market players were focused instead on the five Brent cargoes amassed by one holder . With a spate of deals last week in other North Sea grades that cleared out much of the availability in the first half of July , little other business was being talked . The major was heard to have placed two Brent cargoes into Spain last week and to be bidding at August - 35 cents for barrels to fill a ULCC to move out of the region , although observers were unsure a sale into the U . S . could be make profitable at current arb levels . " The CFDs are picking up , there are wet Brent shorts out there so right now the short - term market is quite tight , " said one trader , who speculated that some of the Brent barrels had gone into the major ' s refineries . Monday ' s wet Brent numbers were sharply up on last week , with August - 50 / - 40 cts quoted on Friday and a June 26 - 28 cargo traded at August - 60 cents last Tuesday . " I think people expect something creative to happen to those cargoes and some of the key players expect dated to go up into the - 20s this week , " said one trader . Some of that strength may derive from growing U . S . demand for Brent , in response to recent heavy Asian buying of the West African grades they would otherwise have purchased , one trader predicted . This week ' s OPEC meeting was not considered an active factor . After a slow start , paper firmed , with inter - month spreads narrowing and this week ' s contract for differences against August jumping in response to the manoeuvres on the Brent market . This week was quoted at - 25 / - 20 against August , up from - 37 / - 32 , while 150 lots of next week against August traded at - 32 cents . July / August , August / September and September / October spreads all traded at - 16 cents . In the Mediterranean no Urals was seen on offer . With first decade July barrels already committed the grade continued to creep upwards and was assessed around dated Brent - 95 / - 90 cents . Refiners said margins were " not good but still positive " following crude ' s recent gains . Nigerian barrels were similarly firmer . A VLCC of Bonny Light / Medium was heard sold into Japan on Friday with the Light moving around dated Brent + 37 - 40 cents and the Medium at a premium of 13 cents to the Benchmark crude . A VLCC of July 18 - 22 Qua Iboe was heard to have been sold to a U . S . refiner at the end of last week but the talked level of dated Brent + 35 cents fob equivalent could not be immediately confirmed and was thought high by some traders . Regular lifters of Syrian crude awaited state oil company Sytrol ' s second offer for liftings of the Light crude in July . The first offer of dated Brent - 55 cents was met by bids from the lifters 10 - 15 cents lower . One refiner said that in the current situation of poor crude oil availabilities the upper hand was with the seller . Sytrol was expected to come out with their second offer on Monday .

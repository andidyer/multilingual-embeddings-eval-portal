Swiss National Bank cuts discount rate to 1 . 0 percent . Swiss National Bank governors Thursday cut the discount rate by half a percentage point to 1 . 0 percent , matching a record low and weakening the strong Swiss franc . A central bank statement said the move , effective Friday , was in line with the recent decline in Swiss money market rates . An SNB spokesman said the bank decided to cut the discount rate as a means of underscoring the recent decline in money market rates . " The ( rate cut ) move is more a reassurance to the market that the interest rate decline since August will not be reversed , " SNB spokesman Werner Abegg said . Market analysts said the move confirmed a trend already evident in the money market , and underscored the SNB ' s intentions to keep money rates low . The central bank noted in its statement that it had been supplying the money market with additional liquidity since the beginning of August " in order to prevent monetary strain " and as a result , some money market rates fell below the discount rate . " By lowering the discount rate , the Swiss National Bank underlines its expectation that the interest rate decline will continue for some time , " it added . The discount rate was last cut to 1 percent in February 1978 , a record low where it stayed until a return to 2 . 0 percent in November 1979 . The most recent rate change was a drop of 50 basis points last Dec . 14 . The Swiss franc , whose strength has been blamed in part for a sluggish economy by making exports expensive , fell against the dollar and German mark immediately after the SNB announcement . The dollar rose to 1 . 2505 / 2515 Swiss francs about an hour after the SNB announcement from 1 . 2425 before the news .

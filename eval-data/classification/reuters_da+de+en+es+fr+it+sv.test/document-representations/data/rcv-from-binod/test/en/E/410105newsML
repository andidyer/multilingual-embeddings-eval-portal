Polish CPI aim seen possible on slower food prices . Slower growth in food prices so far this year may put Poland ' s 1997 ambitious 13 - percent year - on - year inflation target within reach , a senior government analyst said on Friday . Tadeusz Chroscicki , chief analyst at the government ' s Centre for Strategic Studies , said food prices were likely to rise no more than 0 . 5 percent in February after a 1 . 2 - percent jump in January . " The growth of food prices is clearly slower than that of other goods and services , which lowers the overall consumer price index , " he told Reuters . " The results of the first two months indicate that for the first time , the inflation target ( 13 - percent year - on - year ) in the budget law may not differ from reality , " he said . February year - on - year food price growth is expected to slow to 16 . 2 percent from 17 . 7 percent in January , he said . That slowing trend should continue this year to put the the year - on - year food price index at 14 . 2 percent in March and 11 percent in June , Chroscicki said . During that period , he also expected the overall consumer price index to ease , but not drop below 16 percent from January ' s 18 . 1 percent . - - Warsaw Newsroom + 48 22 653 9700

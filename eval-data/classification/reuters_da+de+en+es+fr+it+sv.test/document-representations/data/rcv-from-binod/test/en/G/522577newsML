SWIMMING - SECOND WORLD RELAY RECORD FOR CHINA . China broke their own women ' s 4x100 metres freestyle relay short - course world record in a great duel against Germany at the world short - course world championships on Saturday . The Chinese quartet of Le Jingyi , Chao Na , Shan Ying and Nian Yin clocked three minutes 34 . 55 seconds , with Germany also inside the old mark in 3 : 34 . 69 . The previous record of 3 : 35 . 97 was set by Lu Bin , Shan , Jia Yuanyuan and Le in Palma de Mallorca on December 4 , 1993 . It was the second relay world mark of the championships for China , who broke their own women ' s 4x200 freestyle record on Thursday . Le gave China a great start with a split of 53 . 32 seconds which would have won her Thursday ' s individual 100 freestyle , in which she actually finished third . Antje Buschschulte pulled Germany back in contention on the second leg and Katrin Meissner cut back a little more on the third leg . Sandra Voelker , the individual silver medallist , appeared to have the race at her mercy when she turned ahead with 50 metres to go but Nian gritted her teeth and overhauled her German rival to claim world title and world record at a stroke . Germany had to console themselves with a European record , beating the 3 : 38 . 77 set by East Germans Sabine Schulze , Meissner , Daniela Hunger and Manuela Stellmach in Monaco on December 12 , 1987 . Sweden finished third in 3 : 38 . 07 , also inside the old European mark .

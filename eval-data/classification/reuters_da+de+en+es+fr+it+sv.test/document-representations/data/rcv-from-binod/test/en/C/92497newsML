Indonesia ready to test Habibie ' s car by next year . Indonesian Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie has said a prototype of a car being developed by the government would be ready for road testing by April 1997 , the official Antara news agency reported on Wednesday . Habibie said that around 60 units of the Maleo car would be sold to the public next year as a means of testing the vehicle . " We will ask the people who own the cars to let us know what the car lacks . We will use this information to improve the car , " the minister was quoted as saying . Habibie said the Maleo , being developed by Strategic Industries Board ( BPIS ) which he heads , will use a 1 , 200 cc engine produced by Australia ' s Orbital Engine Company . The idea for the car comes from Habibie , a German - trained aeronautical engineer , and the Maleo has been referred to as " Habibie ' s Volkswagen " . It was planned that local components would comprise more than 60 percent of the Maleo , he said . In February , Indonesia gave special tax and tariff breaks to PT Putra Timor Nasional to make a national car in partnership with Kia Motors of South Korea . The company , which is owned by President Suharto ' s youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra ( Tommy ) , must reach a local component level of 20 percent by the first year of production , 40 percent by the second and 60 percent by the third . The controversial 1 , 600 cc Timor sedan enters the market this month after criticism from Japan , Europe and the United States that the tax breaks given to PT Putra violate World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) rules .

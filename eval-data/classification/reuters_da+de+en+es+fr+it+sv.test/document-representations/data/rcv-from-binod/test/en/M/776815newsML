Euro Products Outlook - mogas leads complex higher . Gasoline is set to play as dominant role over the next few days as it did last week with the other products clearly overshadowed . Over the last two weeks delivered unleaded gasoline has risen nearly $ 30 from $ 190 and there are now few signs of an early weakness . Some analysts had been saying that fresh supplies in NWE from August 15 - 20 onwards would dampen down prices , but tight prompt local supplies and surging U . S . demand has kept gasoline on the boil . News on Friday that three catalytic crackers at three NWE refineries were shut - down have fuelled the flames . One of two catalytic crackers at Shell ' s Pernis Rotterdam site was shut - down for an unscheduled stoppage in August followed by scheduled maintenance of two months . The downed cracker has capacity of 28 , 000 barrels per day . BP and Texaco encountered difficulties which were expected to last " a few days " with their 55 , 000 bpd cat cracker at their Rotterdam Nerefco site . BP and Mobil ' s 60 , 000 bpd Coryton , U . K . cat cracker also went out of commission last week for " essential mainteance following technical problems , " according to BP . Start - up was not expected before Wednesday of this week . Gasoline ' s strength should keep naphtha firm . Fears that gasoline might weaken thus slowing trans - atlantic demand for naphtha have eased . " The Far East doesn ' t really want it ( European naphtha ) so it can only really go the U . S . , " said one dealer . Lack of arbitrage , a high dollar and a seasonal lull in heating oil demand is likely to produce another quiet week with differentials languishing at low levels . The dollar ' s surge to a new 7 - 1 / 2 year high on Friday capped a week of U . S . currency strength that has dampened demand by making gas oil very expensive . A Friday surge in IPE gas oil in line with persistent motor gasoline strength in the United States is likely to inspire further caution among physical buyers . Little change is in view for barge or cargo spreads . Heating oil barges are likely to range between 25 cents to $ 1 over August IPE . Diesel is likely to bump along at a slender $ 4 premium to the heating oil differential . European high sulphur fuel has enjoyed an unseasonal summer vigour since late June , soaring into the low $ 90s from the $ 80 - $ 85 range where it languished for much of the second quarter . Its strength looks set to continue . NWE bunker markets are poorly supplied because considerable quantities of Russian cracked and straight - run fuel is being shipped to North America and Shell ' s new Pernis facility is producing much less high sulphur material . High sulphur barges should trade at $ 90 - $ 95 range this week . With stocks low cracked Russian that does hit the ARA area is quickly absorbed , with prices expected to be stable . Russian and low sulphur straight - run fuel has been highly sought after as refiners seek to fill their crackers with an alternative to expensive crude . Its vigour should continue . One percent will trudge along in the mid $ 90s . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8980

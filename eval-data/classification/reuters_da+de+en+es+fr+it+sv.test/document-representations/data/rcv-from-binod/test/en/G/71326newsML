Vienna boys ' choir goes an octave higher . The Vienna boys ' choir , one of Austria ' s last male bastions , announced on Monday it would be led by a woman for the first time in its history . Agnes Grossmann , a 52 - year - old Austrian , will replace Peter Marschik as conductor of the globetrotting singers . Her father , Ferdinand Grossmann , conducted the boy ' s choir from 1939 to 1945 , and again in 1956 to 1966 . The Vienna boys ' choir dates its origins to the 15th century and included the young Franz Schubert among its members . The modern choir was established in 1924 . Last month , the Vienna Philharmonic - - male - only since it was set up in 1842 - - said it would begin admitting women because there were not enough qualified men to keep the orchestra going .

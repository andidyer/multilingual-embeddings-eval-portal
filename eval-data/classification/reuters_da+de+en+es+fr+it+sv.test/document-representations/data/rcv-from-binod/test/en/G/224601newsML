CRICKET - AZHARUDDIN LEADS FIGHTBACK WITH BRILLIANT 109 . Mohammad Azharuddin , who retired hurt on Thursday , returned to play one of the finest innings seen at Eden Gardens as India fought back in the second test against South Africa on Friday . Azharuddin , forced to go off after being hit on the arm by paceman Brian McMillan when he had scored six , stroked a brilliant 109 to lead India from their overnight 152 for six to 329 all out . South Africa , with a first innings lead of 99 , were 54 for one in their second innings at tea on the third day , an overall lead of 153 . The day began with India requiring 77 more to make South Africa bat again , and they soon lost one of the overnight batsman , Javagal Srinath being bowled by Allan Donald for 11 . Azharuddin responded to the crisis - - 161 for seven - - with his 15th test hundred . Peppered by short - pitched deliveries by the South Africans seeking to expose his weakness against the short rising ball , Azharuddin unleashed a series of pulls to demoralise the opposition . All bowlers came in for punishment , with Lance Klusener singled out for special treatment . The South African debutant was hit for 21 runs in one over as Azharuddin displayed the full range of his wristy strokes . His partner Anil Kumble was not far behind as he displayed skills befitting a top - order batsman , handling pace and spin with equal ease to hit 88 . When South Africa batted again early in the second session , test debutant Herschelle Gibbs , promoted to replace the injured Andrew Hudson , was out cheaply - - brilliantly caught by a diving Rahul Dravid at forward short - leg , fending a short ball from Javagal Srinath .

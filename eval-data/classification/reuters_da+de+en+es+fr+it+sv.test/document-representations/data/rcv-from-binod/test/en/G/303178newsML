Land mines , police are Bosnia concerns - Joulwan . The commander of NATO forces in Europe said on Monday that land mines and the military potential of factional police forces in Bosnia were key concerns for international peacekeepers there . " I think it ( mine clearing ) has not moved as quickly as we would like , " U . S . Army Gen . George Joulwan told reporters . " Every week in Bosnia , civilians are being maimed or killed by mines . " The supreme allied commander of forces in Europe ( SACEUR ) said clearing thousands of mines sown during the civil war was the responsibility of Serbs , Moslems and Croats and the effort should be increased as a NATO - led peacekeeping force of more than 31 , 000 begins a new 18 - month mission there . " The issue of mines in Yugoslavia is going to be with us for a long time to come " Joulwan said at a breakfast with reporters and added this was an example of the international problem of dealing with so - called " dumb mines . " The four - star general , based in Belgium in a dual role of NATO ' S SACEUR and of U . S . forces in Europe , also expressed concern over the potential for violence involving police forces in Bosnia . These police units , which the New York Times has reported may be stockpiling mortars and other weapons , are sometimes commanded by Serbs , Moslems or Croats loyal to their own factions rather than to all citizens . " I share your concern on the size and armaments of some of the former warring fractions ' police forces , " Joulwan said in response to a question . He noted that the police forces were being overseen by an unarmed contingent of fewer than 2 , 000 international police officers sponsored by the United Nations . " I would like to see an increased role and mandate for them , " said Joulwan of the international monitors . At the same time , he said , local police forces in Bosnia must be trained to efficiently handle routine law enforcement functions so that peacekeeping troops were not faced with such tasks . The United States is providing 8 , 500 troops as part of the new international peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Joulwan said the American soldiers would be rotated every six months , from about April .

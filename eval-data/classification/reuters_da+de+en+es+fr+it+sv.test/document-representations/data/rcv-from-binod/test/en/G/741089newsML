Ranariddh says Hunsen ' s move to isoate Cambodia . Ousted prime minister Prince Narodom Ranariddh on Saturday blasted Cambodian strongman Hun Sen ' s rejection of mediation efforts , saying it represented an end to democracy in Cambodia , isolation and a return to civil war . " In rejecting ASEAN ( Association of South East Asian Nations ) mediation , I think Hun Sen is now isolating Cambodia by himself , " Ranariddh told a news conference . " Now I ' m really afraid , we will have again a civil war in my country . I ' m very sad for my country . From now on democracy is finished , it is ended in Cambodia . " Ranariddh made the comment in Bangkok shortly after Hun Sen rejected efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to find a peaceful solution to the problem in Cambodia . Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh after a bloody July 5 - 6 power grab . Ranariddh also announced his FUNCINPEC party and three other parties were forming a movement aimed at finding a non - violence , diplomatic solution to the polical crisis . He said the new movement , the Union of Cambodian Democrat ( UCD ) , wants all the nations of the world to reject " the illegitimate government " in Phnom Penh and to comdemn the slaughter of innocent people . The UCD also urged all nations to suspend international assistance to Hun Sen ' s government .

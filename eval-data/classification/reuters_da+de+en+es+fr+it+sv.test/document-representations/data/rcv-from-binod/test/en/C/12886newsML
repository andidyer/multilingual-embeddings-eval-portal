Lloyd ' s says 75 pct of Names accept recovery plan . Lloyd ' s of London said on Sunday that 75 percent of its members had accepted its recovery plan as of midday on Saturday . It also said its appeal against an injunction served against it in a crucial U . S . court case would be heard on Tuesday in Baltimore , Maryland . U . S . district judge Robert Payne in Virginia ordered the 300 - year - old insurance market late on Friday night to make more information available to American Names by September 23 . Lloyd ' s has set a Wednesday deadline for its 33 , 500 investors worldwide - - called Names - - to accept or reject its recovery plan . Payne ' s ruling did not prevent U . S . Names from accepting the plan , but those who chose to wait could pay funds into an escrow account no later than September 30 and would have until October 30 to accept or not . Under the recovery proposals , Lloyd ' s aims to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas . The plan includes a 3 . 2 billion pound ( $ 5 billion ) settlement offer to Names to soften the cost to them of this .

Placer exit seen roiling Gibraltar . Placer Dome Inc ' s decision on Wednesday to sell its 30 . 8 percent stake in Gibraltar Mines Ltd creates new uncertainties for Gibraltar ' s already fraught efforts to raise financing for its Lomas Bayas copper project in Chile , analysts said . Placer said it retained Nesbitt Burns to " identify strategic buyers " for the stake because Gibraltar , a copper company , did not fit with its focus on gold . A Placer spokesman said the gold giant had already had contacts with potential buyers but declined to identify them . It aims to sell the stake to a single buyer at a share price " substantially above " Gibraltar ' s current market value , he said . Gibraltar shares were up 0 . 15 at 6 . 20 in Toronto . The Gibraltar stake of about 10 . 1 million shares was worth about C $ 63 million at Wednesday ' s market value . Placer carries the interest at US $ 41 million on its books . Placer shares were down 0 . 05 at 33 . 25Although Placer was expected to exit from Gibraltar over time , the announcement today caught analysts and even Gibraltar off guard . " I ' m a little surprised . . . I don ' t know why they are doing this now . I ' m trying to find out myself , " said Gibraltar chief executive Bill Myckatyn , who said he learned of Placer ' s decision late Tuesday . The Placer spokesman said the catalyst for the announcement was Gibraltar ' s success last week in securing a commitment from underwriters for a US $ 140 million primary debt offering for Lomas Bayas after a previous failure . But several analysts were puzzled by the timing , saying it could hurt Gibraltar ' s efforts to arrange another US $ 55 million in financing for Lomas Bayas . " The surprise component is that Gibraltar is in the midst of trying to finance a new mine . . . For Placer to be a seller does not send a good message to the market , " said Gordon Capital analyst Barry Allan . Also , analysts said Placer would have been likely to get a higher price for the stake if it waited for a recovery in the copper market . Placer , which until 1993 owned 68 percent of Gibraltar , set no target date for the sale to be finalized . Myckatyn said Placer ' s decision " obviously is going to impact " Gibraltar ' s financing efforts for Lomas Bayas . It will review its options , which included issuing subordinated debt to a customer , sale of part of the property or an equity issue . An equity offering may be more difficult due to the sudden availability of Placer ' s stake , Myckatyn said . Lomas Bayas was delayed in July after a collapse in copper prices derailed Gibraltar ' s financing plans . The property is slated to be an open pit mine and processing plant with capacity of 60 , 000 tonnes of copper cathode a year . Total mineable reserves are 2 . 277 billion pounds of copper at a grade of 0 . 36 percent . Analysts said it was unclear who would be interested in buying Placer ' s stake since it would not give the buyer control of Gibraltar . Yorkton Securities analyst Doug Leishman said potential buyers might include Japanese smelters but he doubted Placer would be able to sell the stake above market value . Other analysts speculated that the buyer might also take up a new equity issue from Gibraltar , thus gaining a control position . If the buyer were a strong backer of Gibraltar ' s plans , it would be positive because Placer had not been viewed as a strong champion of Gibraltar , they said . Moreover , Placer ' s presence might have been large enough to discourage new investors , they said . " It could be positive going forward , " said Allan . - - Reuters Vancouver Bureau ( 604 ) 664 - 7314

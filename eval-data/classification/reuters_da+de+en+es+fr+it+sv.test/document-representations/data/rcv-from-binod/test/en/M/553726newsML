S . employment report , traders said . Although the market had been making impressive gains in the past few weeks , nervousness was heightened by concerns over the jobs data and possibilities of a stock market correction , they said . " I ' m getting mixed signals , " said Jerry Hegarty , an equity analyst with Thomson Financial Services , adding that he would be very cautious " till the smoke clears a little bit . " Traders noted that S & P 100 index . OEX options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw a lot of call buying early on in a change of tack from the focus on puts in recent days - - an ominous signal from a contrarian point of view .

" The market of course has had an enormous rally , and today is the first day there ' s call buying , " said Jay Shartsis , director of options trading , R . F . Lafferty & Co . " Theres been a long period of put buying , so I wouldn ' t look for much downside , " he noted . " They could stop , they could pull back a little , but the extended period of bearishness gives the market a potent floor . " Still , he added that he would not start a long position from this point . While some of the anxiety in the market could fade after the jobs data , some traders expected volatility to remain high , given continued divergence between the big blue chips and the smaller caps , namely technology stocks . Bob Dickey , a managing director of Dain Bosworth , said the weakness in blue chips and interest in technology stocks today could be the start of a correction to the concentration of fund flow into blue chip stocks . " It ' s not happening as a trend quit yet , but I ' m anticipating that we will see a selloff in blue chips and a rally after that by the small cap stocks , " he said . The Nasdaq 100 index . NDX was up 7 . 38 points to 882 . 12 shortly before the close , with its options on CBOE seeing good interest on the call side . May 900 calls traded 2 , 551 contracts and May 890 calls 1 , 040 contracts . Dickey said , however , that the overall market could see another major slide in the near future , noting that today ' s pullback in the Dow Industrials . DJI from above 7 , 000 could be the second peak of a double - top formation . He said the Dow could eventually correct to around 6 , 400 and the S & P500 index . SPX down to 730 . - - Chicago Derivatives Desk ( ( 312 - 408 - 8750 ) ) E - mail : derivatives @ reuters . com

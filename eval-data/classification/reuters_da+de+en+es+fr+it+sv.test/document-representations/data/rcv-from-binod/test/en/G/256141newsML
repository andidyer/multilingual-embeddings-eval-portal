Party blackmail said to help Belgium ' s Di Rupo . Belgian newspapers lambasted as a political machination on Friday the verdict of a parliamentary inquiry clearing Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo of allegations that he had had sex with under - age boys . A review by his peers of the allegations , completed on Thursday , found no indications of guilt and therefore no elements that would justify his indictment , a move which would surely have ended his career . Since the affair erupted several weeks ago Di Rupo , a 45 - year - old discreet homosexual and the second most senior government politician , insisted that his relationships involved only partners above the age of consent of 16 . In line with constitutional rules on allegations against ministers , at least three reports by the Brussels public prosecutor had been sent to parliament , which set up a special commission to weigh up the contents of the files . Early on Thursday , after three days and nights of often bitter debate , the commission - - made up of members of all the main parties - - found there was no case to answer . The decision was later endorsed by the full legislature . Was justice done or did party politics prevail ? newspaper commentators asked . Most concluded that the merits of the case had barely been addressed by government parliamentarians , who instead were seen focusing their efforts on preserving the centre - left coalition . A threat by Di Rupo ' s Francophone Socialist Party ( PS ) to break up the coalition if Di Rupo were forced to go is believed to have swung over the commission , and later parliament as a whole , creating the majority needed to exonerate him . The De Standaard newspaper said the CVP , Prime Minister Jean - Luc Dehaene ' s Christian People ' s Party , had shown weakness by giving in to what it described as the PS backmail . Het Laatste Nieuws declared the PS the winner of the wrangling . " The CVP went belly - up , " it said . " In Belgium cynicism has become an art form and blackmail a political instrument that has the blessing of the Prime Minister . " De Morgen said the opposition Flemish liberal VLD party had milked the affair ruthlessly in its bid to sink the government and grab power . From the start the party had put Di Rupo in the dock for purely opportunistic aims . Analysts concluded the PS ' s stubborn refusal to sacrifice a damaged Di Rupo , the CVP ' s focus on damage limitation and the VLD ' s outright crucifixion of the minister all smacked of orchestration rather than investigation of the allegations . The outcome of the affair plunged Belgian politics , already in the doghouse after reports of influence - peddling , corruption , murder and ineptitude , even deeper into the mire . Public confidence in Belgium ' s establishment was already at rock bottom after a child sex and murder scandal that erupted last August . Child rapist Marc Dutroux was arrested in that affair and subsequently the bodies of four young girls were discovered and two others rescued . The scandal brought to light police bungling and corruption , and the gloom deepened at the end of the summer after a former government minister was charged in the case of the 1994 murder of a leading socialist politician . More than 250 , 000 people took to the streets of Brussels in October in support of the Dutroux victims ' families in a demonstration that became a show of disgust at the system . In response the government has rushed through a series of legal reforms , and political leaders have begun a process that should lead to long - awaited democratic changes .

Mexico ' s Zedillo owes property taxes - Opposition . A leading Mexican opposition politician accused President Ernesto Zedillo late on Tuesday of owing his own government several years of overdue taxes on a property near the Pacific resort city of Acapulco . Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , a fiery lawyer who led the conservative National Action Party to second place in the 1994 presidential race behind Zedillo , made the accusation during a live interview with Televisa television network . Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet denied the allegations and said Zedillo did not own any property in the area , according to Mexico City ' s Radio Red . No one at the President ' s office was available for comment . Fernandez on Tuesday paid roughly 290 , 000 pesos ( $ 36 , 000 ) in back taxes on a property in a posh residential district called Punta Diamante on the outskirts of Acapulco . But the conservative said his case received widespread media attention while other politicians , including several members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , also owed taxes in the same development . " There are others who own property in this development that have not paid their property tax for 1994 , 1995 , 1996 or 1997 . . . That includes an important member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party . I ' m not sure you want me to mention his name , " Fernandez told Televisa ' s 24 Horas news programme . " I should think so , " answered news anchor Jacobo Zabludowsky . " Zedillo Ponce de Leon , Ernesto , " said Fernandez . When asked if the former candidate could prove the charges , he said : " Absolutely . I have seen the papers . " Mexico ' s president holds near absolute power for a single six - year term and is rarely held to public scrutiny while in office , even by the press and opposition politicians . Zedillo won the 1994 race with about half the popular vote , but has been dogged by an economic crisis that broke out soon after he took office . The Finance Ministry in Mexico has in recent months carried out a campaign to get wealthy Mexicans to pay their taxes , arresting several high - profile businessmen . Fernandez , who campaigned strongly against government corruption , was hurt by revelations late last year that he had not paid taxes on the property . However , Fernandez remains popular and some people unsuccessfully tried to get him to run for mayor of Mexico City in upcoming July elections .

Gold OTC vols spike higher as bullion slides . Business in over - the - counter gold options was brisk and volatilities soared to levels not seen for nearly a year as the underlying price plummeted , dealers said . One month implied volatilities zoomed up to as high as 11 . 5 percent this week as bullion prices dropped to fresh 3 - 1 / 4 year lows , they said . January had eased slightly on Thursday morning to around 10 . 0 / 11 . 0 percent . " It obviously warrants these volatilities in the short term . It ' s vicious . And some of the buying has filtered into the longer term as well , " an options dealer said . A week ago high bids were at around 10 percent , versus 6 . 1 percent at the end of last year , following a steep decline in the underlying price so far this year . Since Tuesday the gold price has been subject to dramatic gyrations , swinging from highs around $ 360 to a low of $ 351 . 40 amid an overall downtrend . " The vols are not as high as when gold got up to $ 415 ( in February 1996 ) , when one - month got up to 15 percent . So there ' s room for them to go higher , " a dealer said . A concentration of open interest was seen at or around $ 350 an ounce , the psychologically significant support level for spot gold , dealers said . " There ' s a long - term support line at around $ 350 - $ 351 . People seem to have bought in advance of that , " he said . But interest in the $ 345 area , seen by some analysts as the next downside target , and even lower was also cropping up . " Today for the first time I sold a $ 330 strike . The $ 340s have been in play a few times but otherwise they have been concentrated between $ 350 and $ 370 , " a dealer in continental Europe said . Both puts and calls were in demand , and the market was mixed as to the short term future of the gold price , dealers said . However , puts appeared to be taking precedence , reflecting an overall bearish tone . " The market is a bit crazy now , there is a lot of volatility . People are afraid of the downside basically , " one European dealer said . " The puts have been coming in on the short end , and on the long end , the one - year stuff , there ' s been some producer selling of calls around $ 370 and $ 380 , " another dealer said . " The professional market is not as busy as I would have expected . It ' s more lively , but not in big amounts , in 10 - 20 , 000 ounces , " he added . Longer term volatilities were slightly firmer . On Thursday morning , three month implied volatilities were bid at 9 . 0 percent , six months at 8 . 0 to 8 . 75 percent and 12 - month at 7 . 7 percent . " When the market is excited like this it starts in the short term . For now the one year volatility is up just a bit , " the dealer said . - - London newsroom + 44 171 542 2936

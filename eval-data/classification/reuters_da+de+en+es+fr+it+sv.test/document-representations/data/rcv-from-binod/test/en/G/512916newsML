Czech Deputy PM says govt mulls cabinet shuffle . Czech Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux said on Wednesday that the government was considering a cabinet shuffle , but that no agreement had been reached . Speaking at a briefing during a government meeting , Lux said that changes were being discussed , but gave no further details . The government has come under heavy criticism recently after a wave of economic data showed the economy had slowed considerably , with industrial and construction output contracting in both January and February . The economic daily Hospdarske Noviny , quoting unnamed sources , reported on Wednesday that some key ministers , including Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik may be sacked . Kocarnik ' s ministry has been sharply criticised for the current state of the capital markets , which investors say is opaque and poorly regulated . Last week , Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak , responsible for market oversight , resigned after several cases where Czech investment fund managers and major shareholders were found to have been stripping assets of the funds under the noses of regulators . - - Jan Lopatka , Prague Newsroom , 420 - 2 - 2423 - 0003

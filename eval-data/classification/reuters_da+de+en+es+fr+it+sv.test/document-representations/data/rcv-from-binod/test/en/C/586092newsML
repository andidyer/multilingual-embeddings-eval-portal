Venezuela state electric company saddled with debt . Venezuela ' s largest electricity generation and distribution company , state - owned Cadafe , is saddled with debts that dwarf its revenues and retard plans to privatize the company , a top government official said Thursday . Cadafe ' s debts of $ 1 . 5 billion " are 40 times higher than the total annual billing of Cadafe for power sales , " Venezuelan Investment Fund ( FIV ) President Alberto Poletto said in Congress . Low tariffs and the failure of public sector clients to pay their bills led Cadafe to a precarious financial state , said Poletto who runs the state body in charge of privatization . About 30 percent of Cadafe ' s bills are sent to state organizations and 90 percent of those bills are overdue . " Privatization implies paying bills and raising tariffs , " he said .

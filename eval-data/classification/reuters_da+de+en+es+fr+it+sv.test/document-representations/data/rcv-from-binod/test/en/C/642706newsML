Polish Bank Handlowy share ad triggers probe . The Polish Securities Commission ( KPW ) on Friday said a broadcast advertisement by Bank Handlowy SA about its public share offer did not breach Commission rules but it asked the Anti - Monopoly Office to probe the matter . The ad features a taxi driver saying he plans to build a house or educate his son in the future out of proceeds from Handlowy shares . " There are no elements ( in the Handlowy ad ) which would be in conflict with regulations . . . such as guaranteed profits . . . but there is indirect encouragement to buy the shares today and in large numbers , " KPW spokeswoman Beata Stelmach told Reuters . " The commission asked the Anti - Monopoly Office ( UOKK ) to determine whether the commercial complied with rules of fair competition , " she added . According to Polish regulations , an advertisement cannot entice its audience to buy a company ' s shares by saying that they are better than other investments . State - owned Handlowy ' s one billion zloty initial public offering , which is supported by a wide media campaign , started on May 26 and will run until June 13 . In the television and radio advertisement a taxi driver tells a passenger : " Everyone is saying order ( Handlowy ) shares , as quickly and as many as possible , " adding that he himself aims to use his to build a house or send his son to college . The Securities Commission ' s former chief Leslaw Paga , one of several prominent critics of the campaign , told Gazeta Wyborcza daily this week that Handlowy ' s ad posed ethical problems and promised sure , considerable profits . A Handlowy official told Reuters earlier that the bank did not intend to comment on criticisms of the advertisements . ( ( - - Jacek Ramotowski + 48 22 653 9700 ) )

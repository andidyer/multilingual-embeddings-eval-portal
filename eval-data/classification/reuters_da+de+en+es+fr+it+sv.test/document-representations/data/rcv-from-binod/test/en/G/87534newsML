SOCCER - REAL GO TOP AS RAUL CELEBRATES INTERNATIONAL CALL - UP . Teenage striker Raul Gonzalez celebrated his international call - up by putting Real Madrid on the way to the top of the Spanish first division with a 2 - 0 win over Espanyol on Tuesday . With 14 points from six games , Real are one point ahead of Barcelona , who have played one game less . Just six minutes into the match , Raul finished off a fine move down the left by Croatian forward Davor Suker to score his fourth goal of the season . Twenty minutes later Espanyol keeper Toni Jimenez found a 30 - metre free - kick from Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos too hot to handle , and Suker pounced on the rebound to make it 2 - 0 . Both sides had chances to score after the break , but the game became scrappy and Real ' s Italian coach Fabio Capello was clearly unhappy with his team at stages . Real defensive giant Francisco Hierro picked up a heavy knock during the game and is doubtful for Spain ' s World Cup group game with the Czech Republic next week . Real have not been top of the first division since the first game of last season , which they ended in sixth place .

FOCUS - Thistle Hotels sets slim premium on debut . Thistle Hotels on Wednesday made its stock market debut in a flotation valuing London ' s biggest hotel group at 1 . 05 billion pounds ( $ 1 . 6 billion ) . Chairman Robert Peel said he was pleased with the results of the flotation and denied suggestions the company had joined the market near a peak in hotel demand . He told Reuters he had personally bought about 575 , 000 of the shares on offer and was gratified that they had gone to a slim premium in early trading . After rising as high as 175p , the stock later slipped back to close at 172 - 1 / 2p compared with the 170p flotation price confirmed earlier by New Zealand ' s Brierley Investments Ltd whose stake in Thistle falls to 46 from 70 percent as a result of the float . Thistle , formerly Mount Charlotte Group until it was taken over by Brierley in 1990 , saw volume of some 34 . 27 million shares , making it the most actively traded stock in London . " We are all delighted to be a UK public company again and we have had tremendous support from the retail investor , " Peel told Reuters in an interview . " It ' s great to be back . " In its previous incarnation as Mount Charlotte Hotels , which Peel also headed , Thistle was taken over by Brierley in 1990 . Peel said the company had 13 of the top 20 British institutions among its 33 , 000 shareholders . The Thistle chairman played down the significance of the company ' s flotation price being at the bottom of the range between 170p and 210p initially set by Brierley . " At the end of the day what ' s important is that there is a true market price out there , " he said , " and that the environment we are working in is good . " Peel said he did not believe the British hotel sector was close to a peak in demand , having bounced back from a slump in the early 1990 ' s caused by recession and the Gulf war . He said the industry ' s outlook remained promising as long as exchange rate movements did not price U . S . tourists out of Britain and the domestic economy continued to expand at a steady pace of about two percent . Peel said room occupancy rates in London had not yet reached the 80 percent levels common before the slump of the early 1990s . " Things are pretty healthy looking forward , " he said . Thistle raised some 237 . 6 million pounds through the offering . Analysts said the price was pegged at the bottom of the indicated range because of fears that a rush by hotel companies to list on the stock market would dull investors ' appetite . Hotel companies have been seeking stock market listings to capitalise on a recovery in British business and consumer demand after a lengthy downturn . Interest in the sector was given a further boost earlier this year by Granada Group ' s bid for Forte - - the country ' s biggest hotel group . The flotation allows Brierley Investments to realise its aim of reducing its holding in Thistle below 50 percent . Thistle became the New Zealand conglomerate ' s biggest asset after the Mount Charlotte takeover and it was always understood that Brierley would want to cut its holding . A Brierley spokesman in Wellington said a slide in Brierley ' s shares from a recent high of NZ $ 1 . 44 showed investors had expected Thistle to float at the bottom of the price range . Brierley ' s shares closed two cents lower at $ 1 . 37 . Analysts said Thistle had looked expensive at the upper end of the price range . " The general perception was that it was quite an expensive offering on measures such as cash flow , historic return on capital and normalised earnings before depreciation and tax , " said Fraser Ramzan , analyst at Lehman Brothers . Thistle ' s focus is in the four - star market . The group has 100 hotels in total , including 24 in London and 25 in Scotland . ( $ 1 = . 6385 Pound )

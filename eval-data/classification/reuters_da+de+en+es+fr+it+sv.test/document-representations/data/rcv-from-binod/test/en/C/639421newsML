Grinaker may complete unbundling within yr . Grinaker Holdings plans to continue its unbundling and hopes to have it completed within a year , Jack Saulez , chairman of Grinaker unit , information technology company Siltek Ltd said on Thursday . " The unbundling process started with Grinaker Construction . . . That unbundling was very successful and showed it will pay us to unbundle . We are looking at a complete unbundling exercise , but we need to get past this point to think the rest out , " he said . " It could be completed within a year . " Unbundling is a South African term for the sale or flotation of corporate divisions . Saulez was speaking at the announcment of Hewlett - Packard ' s purchase of certain businesses and related assets of Siltek ' s HiPerformance Systems unit . Grinaker Construction was listed separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last December . Holdings company Grinaker ' s Grintek Ltd and Siltek could add about 500 million rand to their share value through an unbundling , Saulez said . Responding to market speculation the group might list its Grinaker Electronics unit , Saulez said : " Grinaker Electronics is too small to list separately , but we might find partners for it . " Local electronics company Persetel Holdings had not approached Grinaker regarding the purchase of a stake in any of its units , or its stake in any other information technology or electronics companies , Saulez said . Asked whether Grintek intended raising its shareholding in Q Data Ltd , Saulez said : " Increasing our stake in Q Data is an option as well . We ' re not discounting any possibilities . Technically we could buy control of Q Data , but I don ' t think it ' s on the cards . " Grintek has a 56 . 9 percent stake in Siltek , which holds 44 . 1 percent of Q Data . Siltek said earlier on Thursday that it agreed to sell certain businesses and related assets of its HiPerformance Systems unit to Hewlett - Packard Co . The two companies said they expected the purchase price , payable in cash on November 1 , to be based on the tangible net asset value of the businesses as at October 31 , plus a payment for goodwill . Siltek said it would explore investing the proceeds of the sale to form business partnership with Hewlett - Packard and other information technology concerns . Shares in Siltek and its majority shareholder Grintek Ltd jumped in Thursday morning trade , shortly after news of the announcement later . Siltek closed 50 cents up at 23 . 50 rand after moving as high as 23 . 60 earlier in the day . Grintek added 10 cents to finish at 400 cents after rising to a day ' s high of 410 cents . - - Johannesburg newsroom + 27 11 482 - 1003

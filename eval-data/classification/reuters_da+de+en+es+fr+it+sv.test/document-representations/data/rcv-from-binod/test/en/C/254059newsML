Statoil sees record high Norway oil output in 1996 . Oil production from Statoil operated fields in Norwegian waters will reach about 475 million barrels in 1996 , the highest volume ever produced by the state energy company in a single year , Den norske stats oljeselskap AS said on Thursday . This year ' s crude output is expected to be six percent up from 1995 when Statoil fields produced 448 million barrels , but production will fall about five million barrels below earlier forecasts for 1996 , according to the company ' s Status Weekly newsletter . Statfjord in the North Sea is the largest single contributor to overall production with the main field flowing around 163 million barrels . In addition , the Statfjord East and North satellites will pumped some 42 million barrels this year . Statoil said low pressure production at Statfjord had yielded more oil than expected from the Statfjord development . Gullfaks will produce close to 160 million barrels , including output from the Gullfaks West satellite . Heidrun off mid - Norway is set to end the year with an output of roughly 76 million barrels . In April Statoil raised production at Heidrun to 250 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) from 220 , 000 bpd . " This field has produced above last year ' s original forecast , but below the revised estimate presented in the spring . This reflects unexpected interruptions caused by problems with the flare tip , " Statoil said . Actual output at the small Yme development also will be lower then previously forecast at eight million barrels due to gas injection problems . The North Sea Veslefrikk field would yield about 26 million barrels , Statoil said . The state oil company said the start up of the Sleipner West development in late August had substantially increased the group ' s condensate production in 1996 . Overall output of unstabilised condensate piped to Kaarstoe , north of Stavanger on the west coast of Norway , for processing will approach 44 million barrels this year , it said . - - Tanya Pang , Oslo newsroom , + 47 22 42 50 41

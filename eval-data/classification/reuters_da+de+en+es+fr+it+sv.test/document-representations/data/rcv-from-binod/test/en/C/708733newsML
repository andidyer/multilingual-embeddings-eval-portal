Indonesia says deregulation package next week . Indonesia will announce a package of economic deregulation measures next week , State Secretary Murdiono said on Friday . " The president has in general agreed on the deregulation package proposed by the ministers , " Murdiono told reporters after a mini - cabinet meeting chaired by President Suharto . " But there are some details which will take time to work out . We hope to announce the package next week , " he added . Earlier , finance ministry officials said the package had been finalised and was to be presented to Suharto at the meeting . The deregulation measures were previously scheduled for last month but Coordinating Minister for Economics and Finance Saleh Afiff was quoted as saying on June 20 there were some differences of opinion among ministers involved in drawing up the proposals . On June 25 , Murdiono said the package was at the final stage , indicating the differences had been resolved . The Indonesian government routinely unveils measures aimed at bolstering economic growth ahead of the meeting of the Consultative Group on Indonesia , a grouping of donor nations and financial institutions led by the World Bank . The group is to meet later this month in Tokyo .

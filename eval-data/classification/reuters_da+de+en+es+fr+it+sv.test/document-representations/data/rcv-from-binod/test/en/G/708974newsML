Mayor Barry declares D . C . safest city in the nation . Washington ' s controversial Mayor Marion Barry said Saturday the streets of the nation ' s capital were the safest in the United States and blamed the media for portraying the city as crime - ridden , rundown and traffic - choked . " It is safe or safer than Topeka , Kansas , " he declared during an interview on the CNN program " Evans and Novak . " Barry , who won a fourth term as mayor in 1994 after serving a prison term on a drug conviction , accused the media of " beating up " on Washington and complained that the District of Columbia ' s unique status made it impossible for him - - or anyone - - to successfully manage the city . Washington D . C . is not a state , but must provide some of the same services as one . It pays for such expensive items as its own prisons and medical payments for the poor while other U . S . cities pass along these costs to their state governments . The city hit financial rock bottom several years ago , unable to pay its bills or provide basic services for its 600 , 000 residents , prompting Congress to take away Barry ' s authority over spending by naming a chief financial officer who answers to a control board . A bail - out plan for the nation ' s capital , backed by President Clinton , is currently making its way through Congress . Barry blamed his predecessor for Washington ' s huge deficits as well as the federal city ' s inability to tax the thousands of people who work in the District by day but live in the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia . Barry adamantly rejected the notion that Congress , which represents hundreds of millions of Americans who do not live in the nation ' s capital , should have any part at all in administering it . " Absolutely not . You look at Paris , you look at other nations ' capitals , including Communist Beijing , the local people decide how to manage their government . . . Congress has given us a Trojan Horse , " he said . " The best manager in America , in the world , couldn ' t manage this government the way it ' s structured . " Barry urged visitors to come to Washington - - where tourism is a major source of income - - declaring that " the downtown part of our city is safer than any city in America . " He said the facts did not substantiate the media ' s bleak scenario , despite a recent independent study showing a huge jump in homicides , robberies , car thefts and assaults between 1985 and 1997 . " New Orleans has a higher homicide rate than Washington . Atlanta , Newark , another dozen cities have high homicide rates . . . homicide and violence is a product of the American society , in Chicago , in Los Angeles , in New York , in Detroit . . . this is the life if a big city , " he said . FBI statistics , quoted in Saturday ' s Washington Post , said New Orleans had 351 murders last year while Washington had 397 . Barry declared crime overall was down in Washington , and took credit for what he called a more efficient and dependable government . " I think most people would agree that I have led us from the valley of despair . . . to a mountaintop of happiness and hope , " he said . Barry declined to say whether he would seek a fifth term in 1998 , although a recent Washington Post poll showed that 80 percent of people in the District did not want him to run for re - election .

In the coastal city of Jepara , an angry crowd attacked a police station after a PPP supporter died in a road accident involving a car driven by a policeman , Kompas newspaper reported . The PPP is one of the three political parties allowed to contest the general elections . The other two parties are Golkar and the Christian - Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) . The election campaign will last through May 23 and each party is allotted a separate part of the country in which to campaign each day . The three parties are vying for the backing of nearly 125 million voters to fill 425 elected seats in the 500 - House of Representatives . The other seats are alloted to the military , which does not vote . The PPP has repeatedly defied a ban on street parades during the campaign period . The party campaigned across the main island of Java on Sunday and brought out tens of thousands of supporters onto the streets in major cities , including Jakarta . Central Java province has been particularly tense in the run - up to the election following clashes between PPP and Golkar supporters . The first clashes broke out last month after reports that a popular folk singer who had campaigned for the PPP in the past announced that he would be a Golkar candidate in the elections . Golkar , in power for 30 years under President Suharto , is expected to easily retain its majority in parliament . It is seeking to push its share of the vote over 70 percent from the 68 percent it won in the last polls in 1992 . The PPP won 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent .

Taiwan confirms president Lee to meet Dalai Lama . Taiwan said President Lee Teng - hui would meet the visiting Dalai Lama on Thursday in an encounter Beijing has already scorned as the collusion of " splittists " bent on dividing communist China . In another development certain to pique China , a longtime anti - communist group said it had arranged a Wednesday supper between Tibet ' s exiled spiritual leader and Lien Chan , Taiwan ' s vice president and premier . President Lee and the Dalai Lama had both said they wanted to meet and planning for their encounter had been an open secret for days , but until Wednesday , Taiwan ' s Nationalist government had refused to confirm the meeting . Reflecting the acute Taiwan - China tensions surrounding the Dalai Lama ' s Taiwan stay , Lee ' s audience would take place at the Foreign Ministry ' s Taipei Guest House rather than his office . " The meeting will last about an hour , " a Lee aide said . Lien ' s date with the Dalai Lama would take place discreetly at a downtown Taipei hotel , according to the sponsoring World League for Freedom and Democracy - - a private group whose title once included the word " Anti - Communist " . The Dalai Lama , revered by Tibetan Buddhists as a god - king despite his decades of exile in India , has said he hoped to discuss " spiritual reforms " with Lee , a devout Presbyterian . Chang Ling - chen , a National Taiwan University political scientist , said the island should expect more China protests . " The Chinese communists have never stopped oppressing Taiwan diplomatically , but the meeting will prompt them to accelerate their diplomatic oppression , " Chang said by telephone . " No matter how the sides play down the meeting , no matter what they discuss during the meeting . . . the meeting itself is politically significant , " Chang said . The planned encounter had angered Beijing , which has painted the Dalai Lama ' s Taiwan tour and the Lee meeting as part of a strategy to secure independence from China for both Tibet and Nationalist - ruled Taiwan . Beijing on Tuesday scorned the Dalai Lama ' s statement that he sought only self - rule for Tibet , not independence . " On one side the Dalai Lama publicises internationally the view that he does not want Tibetan independence , on the other side he everywhere engages in activities to split the motherland , " government spokesman Cui Tiankai said in Beijing . " This makes clear he is basically not sincere and has certainly not put aside his stance for so - called Tibetan independence , " Cui said . The exiled Republic of China government that has existed only on Taiwan since its 1949 civil war loss of the mainland still maintains that the island should one day reunite with China , though not before Beijing adopts democracy . But Taiwan ' s democratic reforms since the 1980s have given new voice to open calls for a sovereign Republic of Taiwan . That angers China , which calls Taiwan a rebel - held region that must " reunify with the motherland " . The Dalai Lama arrived in Taiwan on Saturday for an unprecedented six - day visit , his first return to Chinese soil since he fled his Himalayan homeland in 1959 after the failure of an uprising against Chinese rule of Tibet . Since his arrival on Saturday , the Dalai Lama was known to have met only a few senior Taiwan officials , including Interior Minister Lin Feng - cheng and Provincial Governor James Soong .

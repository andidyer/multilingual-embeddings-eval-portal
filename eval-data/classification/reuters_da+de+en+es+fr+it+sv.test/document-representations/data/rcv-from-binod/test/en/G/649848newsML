HK Democrats sue over China - appointed legislature . Hong Kong ' s Democratic Party filed a court injunction on Tuesday to challenge the constitutional legality of Beijing ' s hand - picked shadow legislature set to replace a democratically - elected assembly upon the June 30 handover of the British colony . Legal experts said the move , just 21 days before China takes over , had little chance of success but would cause intense embarrassment and may temporarily block the Beijing - selected chamber already forced to meet across the border in China . Democratic Party legislator Albert Ho , who like fellow party members will be cast out of office when the Provisional Legislature is installed , filed the writ in the High Court on behalf of party co - founder Ng King - luen , 74 , the plaintiff . " That organisation unlawfully seized law - making power which belongs solely to the present Legislative Council , " Ho told reporters . Britain and its Western allies have attacked the new assembly , questioning its legitimacy and plan to boycott any investiture ceremony . In Washington , U . S . State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Secretary of State Madeline Albright , who will be a guest at the handover ceremony , would not go to the swearing - in .

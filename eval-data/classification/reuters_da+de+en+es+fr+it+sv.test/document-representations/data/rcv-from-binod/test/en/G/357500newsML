Romania wins strong French backing on NATO . Romanian President President Emil Constantinescu won strong backing from French President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday for Bucharest ' s drive to join NATO and urged France to act as a " sponsor " of a revived Romania . Chirac told Constantinescu , on his first trip to the West since beating ex - communists in elections in November , that France " would plead strongly with its allies for Romania to be among the first four or five countries to join NATO . " Speaking after an hour of talks in Paris , Chirac did not name any of the other candidates from the former East bloc . Chirac said he " favoured the entry ( of Romania ) in the first wave of NATO ' s expansion , which should in principle be discussed or decided in Madrid on July 7 " . Romania ' s bid for early membership of NATO , once a long shot behind favourites Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , has gained some ground in recent weeks largely because of French support . Slovenia ' s prospects have also improved . Chirac told reporters Bucharest ' s drive was " legitimate " and " justified " . French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette also said last month that Paris would back Bucharest . Constantinescu , touring European countries , said he hoped France would reassert close ties with Romania that included strong economic and cultural links in the 19th century . France also helped Romania battle Germany in World War One . " We want to believe that France . . . will agree once again to be the sponsor of a revived Romania , " he said in a speech to the French Institute of Foreign Relations ( IFRI ) . He said Romania could help Western Europe by acting as a mediator in eastern Europe , thanks to ties with nations including former Yugoslavia , Moldavia , Hungary and countries on the Black Sea . " There is no alternative to European and Euro - Atlantic integration " for Romania , he said . Opinion polls even before the elections showed that 95 percent of voters wanted integration into Europe , he said . Constantinescu also said he had found a " great friend of Romania " in Chirac . Chirac is to visit Romania on February 20 and 21 , the first Western leader to travel to Romania since the elections . Chirac said France would help Romania ' s efforts to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) " which is the immediate problem , but also the European Union , which we strongly desire " . Before joining the EU , Constantinescu said Romania had to tackle deep economic problems . He said official statistics by the former ex - communist leaders drastically underestimated budget deficits and grossly overestimated economic growth . " Privatisation reforms in Romania were linguistic , " he added , saying that the names of companies were changed but that communist - style management remained .

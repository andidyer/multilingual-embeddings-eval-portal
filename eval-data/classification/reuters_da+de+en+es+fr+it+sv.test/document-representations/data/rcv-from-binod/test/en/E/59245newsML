Kuwait central bank seeks more economic reform . Kuwait ' s central bank governor said the Gulf Arab country ' s economy needed further reform despite the " positive improvement " of 8 . 2 percent growth in 1995 , state - owned Kuwait News Agency reported . " He warned . . . against reading too much into this positive improvement because it was linked to international developments in the oil and financial markets , " the agency reported , referring to the governor , Sheikh Salem Abdul - Aziz al - Sabah . The agency said Sheikh Salem was commenting on a previously - reported 8 . 2 percent gain in gross domestic product to 7 . 952 billion dinars ( $ 26 . 595 billion ) in calendar 1995 compared to a 1 . 6 percent rise to 7 . 349 billion in 19UU . " Sheikh Salem called for more efforts to improve the economy and continue economic growth with steady ( growth ) averages through serious planning to overcome structural imbalances , " the agency said . " Through these reforms we can broaden the production base in the non - oil sector and diversify and increase sources of income , " it directly quoted him as sayingIndependent economists have said the oil - exporting country ' s economic growth was the result of higher than expected prices for oil , which accounts for 85 percent of export earnings . The agency added : " Sheikh Salem linked economic development to the oil and foreign investment sectors , and said their improvements were due to international circumstances that should not be depended on or taken for granted . " Sheikh Salem said Kuwaiti consumption was high and did not correspond to any marked increase in local production of non - oil products . He said consumption exceeded local production of non - oil goods by 128 percent in 1995 , little changed from 126 percent in 1989 , despite a fall in Kuwait ' s population during the period due to demographic changes caused by the 1990 - 91 Gulf crisis . The governor forecast a " tangible " drop in the state budget deficit in the 1995 / 96 fiscal year that ended on July 31 " in light of a continued drop in the deficit over the previous four years . The agency gave no figures . The Kuwaiti government has said it expects the 1995 / 96 deficit to be less than half the 1 . 32 billion dinars projected because of higher than expected oil prices and lower than expected government spending . The government had planned for spending of 4 . 23 billion dinars , equivalent to 53 percent of 1995 gross domestic product , and revenues of 2 . 910 billion in 1995 / 96 . Sheikh Salem commended heightened stock market activity in 1995 , noting volume as measured by the number of traded shares jumped 226 . 3 percent and share prices rose on average 39 . 5 percent , the agency said . ( $ 1 = 0 . 299 dinars )

U . S . , Mexico pledge to step up drug fight . The United States and Mexico on Wednesday pledged to step up their fight against drug trafficking and Mexico said it would accept more U . S . - donated helicopters to help eradicate drug crops . On the last day of a two - day visit to Mexico by U . S . anti - drug chief Barry McCaffrey , officials gave strong signs that the recent firing of Mexico ' s previous attorney general , U . S . favourite Antonio Lozano Gracia , had not rocked the two countries ' anti - drug ties . " We don ' t what rhetoric , we want advances . I invite you to compare rhetoric with deeds in June , " McCaffrey told a news conference , pledging solid achievements before his next scheduled meeting with new Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar next year . U . S . and Mexican officials meet regularly as part of a top - level bilateral drug control group formed nine months ago . Washington ' s drug cooperation would be underscored by its supply to Mexico of 73 U . S . helicopters , 20 of which have already arrived , officials said . They would be capable of transporting 21 , 000 troops striving to wipe out marijuana and opium poppy crops . A document released after the news conference said that in the first 11 months of 1996 , Mexico had wiped out 34 , 000 hectares ( 84 , 000 acres ) of drug crops , of which almost half were poppies , the raw material of opium . Mexico is a transshipment point for as much as 70 percent of South American cocaine passing into the United States , and relations between the two countries have often been soured by U . S . criticism that its southern neighbour was not doing enough to stem the tide . Mexico ' s drug team was recently shaken up with the firing earlier this month of Lozano and the appointment of a military officer to head the National Anti - Drug Institute .

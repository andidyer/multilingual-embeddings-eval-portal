FEATURE - Business booms for soul - searcher Chopra . The first observation Deepak Chopra had on Singapore was that it lacked " carefreeness and playfulness " . He then went on to calmly argue against hard work and competitive drive as key ingredients for success to an audience brought up in a culture based on such values . In Singapore for a one - day seminar in November , the best - selling author of books that link health and success with spirituality had other thought - provoking responses for sceptics , fans and the plain curious . " Hard work , discipline and ambition lead to heart attacks and to hypertension and to drug addiction and to divorce . There is a more creative , more nourishing , more easy , carefree way of doing things , " insisted Chopra . Chopra has written 18 books and sold at least 10 million copies translated into 25 languages - - with esoteric titles like Quantum Healing , Ageless Body , Timeless Mind and The Way of the Wizard . Time magazine called him Emperor of the Soul . Chopra - - seen by some as a quack , by others as a messenger of hope - - has grabbed the attention of millions worldwide through his books , seminars , and television shows as well as through news reports that have sniggered at his connection to Hollywood ' s rich and famous , among them actress Demi Moore . " Hollywood is less than 0 . 1 percent of the people I see , " was his reply to a question on his credibility . However , admitting that the " guru to the stars " tag had distorted public perceptions of his work , he told reporters he had asked his celebrity friends to resign from the board of advisors of his Centre for Well Being in La Jolla , California . In person , Chopra has a presence one would expect from a man who commands a worldwide following . His penetrating eyes are hard to avoid even in a roomful of people . One - on - one , he exudes the concern of a close friend , leaning towards you in rapt attention . " I consider myself an explorer . I raise more questions than I answer , " Chopra said . Believing that intuition , creativity and vision are important ingredients for success , he said his job was to study people who had demonstrated these little - understood qualities - - like Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein . " If I can learn what these people know , then maybe I can do the same things . " Chopra ' s spiritual search led him from being a successful endocrinologist and chief of staff at New England Memorial Hospital back to his Indian roots in the 1980s . He studied Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) and the ancient Indian Ayurvedic method of healing from TM founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Convinced he could open the minds of doctors more effectively to the applicability of holistic healing methods by addressing large medical conferences , he quit his hospital post . Today he has extended his quest for the secrets ingredients of well - being in the corporate world . The essential message is that profitability does not have to hinge on a winner - loser situation . Chopra had no qualms about admitting he makes more money than ever - - his usual fee is US $ 25 , 000 for a three - hour lecture . He is mulling a Broadway musical for children based on The Way of The Wizard and is planning another five to six books , including one on death . Is the soul man afraid of dying ? " No , I don ' t think so . If you are aware death is stalking you all the time , your life would be magical because your priorities will change . " A suitable epitaph , he said , would be : " Deepak Chopra , a good father " . " I feel very grateful to my family and to my children , particularly , who have never taken me seriously - - it keeps me feeling grounded , " he said .

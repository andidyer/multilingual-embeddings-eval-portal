SOCCER - RIVER PLATE WIN ARGENTINE TITLE . River Plate clinched the Argentine championship on Wednesday with a 3 - 0 win over Velez Sarsfield but their celebrations were spoiled by the sending off of star player Ariel Ortega . River , one of the two giants of Argentine soccer , had only needed a draw against the defending champions to win the 1996 - 97 Apertura championship , the first of two tournaments played in the Argentine season . But River , who have won 14 of their 17 games , won convincingly , helped by two goals from Chilean midfielder Marcelo Salas , one of the stars of their campaign . They took the title with two games to spare . The night ' s black spot was the dismissal of the hugely talented Ortega , sent off in the second half along with Claudio Hussain of Velez . Ortega was the only Argentine player to perform impressively as his country drew 1 - 1 at home to Chile in Sunday ' s World Cup qualifier . It was River ' s 25th title in Argentine professional soccer , although many of the earlier championships featured only teams from Buenos Aires . Last year , Velez won both championships , the first team to do so since the two - championship format was introduced in 1991 . Second - placed Independiente were beaten 3 - 2 away by Huracan - Corrientes . Coached by veteran Cesar Luis Menotti , who led Argentina to victory in the 1978 World Cup , Independiente began the competition brightly but faded badly . Boca Juniors , River ' s great rivals , had a doubly miserable night . As well as having to endure River celebrations , Boca , who last week saw coach Carlos Bilardo resign , were hammered 4 - 2 by Rosario Central .

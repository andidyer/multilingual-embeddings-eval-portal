FEATURE - Philippines looks to diversify energy sources . The Philippines , which only four years ago was enduring power cuts of up to 10 hours every day , is now basking in its highest ever generating capacity . But the country has paid a high price for the dramatic turnaround and is now looking to cheaper forms of generation . The 60 - year - old state National Power Corp has power reserves of 40 percent , compared to 1992 when power deficiency levels reached 1 , 000 megawatts and power cuts brought industry to a virtual standstill . " We are keeping a very high level of reserve , at 40 percent , because we await the commissioning of more reliable power plants . Once these power plants are in , then we can drop the reserve requirement to the usual level of 20 percent , " Energy Minister Francisco Viray told Reuters . A 40 percent power reserve means that of the 4 , 000 megawatts required daily by the main Luzon grid , some 1 , 600 megawatts of power plant capacity is on stand - by . Luzon is the Philippines most populous island . Viray said 20 percent was usually regarded as a comfortable reserve and was the level maintained by most Asian countries . Reserves should normally be the equivalent of the capacity of the grid ' s biggest power plant , he added . But he conceded that maintaining a high power reserve level was not without costs . Most of the power plants which make up the reserves were gas turbines fuelled either by diesel or bunker fuel , Napocor system operations officer - in - charge Rolando Bacani said . Power from gas turbines costs about 2 . 0 pesos per kilowatt - hour ( kwh ) while cost of power from other types of plant range from 1 . 30 to 1 . 68 pesos per kwh . " We definitely have sufficient power although we still have some transmission line limitations . The 40 percent reserve is possibly the highest in Philippine history , " Bacani said . Economist and former Philippine National Oil Co chairman Benjamin Diokno said the government ' s energy and power agencies may have erred in overestimating the country ' s power needs . " I think we over - reacted and that because of the mad rush to put on stream more power plants , we have over invested in fuel - fired power plants . It is turning out to be more costly for the country , " Diokno told Reuters . Recognising the need to diversify energy sources , the energy department has put a lid on oil - based power plants . On August 26 , Viray signed an administrative order stopping accreditations to build bunker oil - fired or diesel - fired power plants . " We do not want to be too dependent on one type of fuel . We want to control the share of oil in the power generation mix . We want to diversify and the discovery of the Camago - Malampaya gas field in Northwest Palawan paves the way for the country to start a gas industry , " Viray said . In a newly revised 30 - year Philippine energy programme , covering the years 1996 to 2025 , the Department of Energy reiterated its goal of diversifying energy sources . It envisages oil ' s share in the power generation mix as dwindling from its current 41 . 6 percent to just 8 . 3 percent by the year 2010 . It will largely be replaced by natural gas . By 2010 , natural gas will provide 19 . 6 percent of the power generation , from a current level of zero , followed by coal at 16 . 1 percent from this year ' s 20 . 5 percent . Geothermal power will fall from the current 22 . 6 percent to 12 . 6 and hydro from 15 . 3 to 8 . 6 . Gas production is projected to reach 967 . 2 billion cubic feet in 2025 inclusive of the Camago - Malampaya gas find . The 30 - year plan also discussed the entry of nuclear power after the year 2005 possibly by 2007 , Viray said . This is the first time the government has considered nuclear energy since a debacle in the early 1980s over a 620 - mw nuclear power plant had to be mothballed amid intense legal wranglings over alleged corruption . The energy plan requires 7 . 73 trillion pesos ( $ 295 billion ) , of which 91 percent will be sourced from the private sector . This sum covers the entire energy sector from exploration to refining but most of the financing will be required to install 92 , 138 mw of power over the 30 years . Former presidential energy adviser Peter Garrucho lauds the government ' s efforts to diversify fuel sources . " We have to have competitive power and clearly the best alternatives are natural gas , coal and geothermal , " Garrucho , who is now president of First Gas Holdings Corp ( FGHC ) , told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday . Garrucho said the next challenge was to set up a distribution system to bring natural gas to the market . " One has to deal with difficulties in getting rights - of - way especially in a densely populated market as Manila . But really the direction of spreading it ( power sources ) around , going low cost is really the way to go , " Garrucho added . Conversion $ = 26 . 2

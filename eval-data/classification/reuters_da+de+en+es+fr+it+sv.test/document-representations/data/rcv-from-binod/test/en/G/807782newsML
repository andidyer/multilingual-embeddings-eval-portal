TENNIS - CHANG , KUERTEN ADVANCE AT HAMLET CUP . Top seed Michael Chang had a long night on Long Island Monday . The world number two drew defending champion Andre Medvedev as his opening round opponent at the Hamlet Cup and the Ukranian made Chang work hard for both sets before the American prevailed 7 - 6 6 - 4 ( 8 - 6 ) . Medvedev kept Chang on court for one hour and 45 minutes , prolonging what could have been a swift first set and saving two match points in the second before Chang finally advanced to the second round . In the late match , French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten , decked out in his usual bright blue and yellow outfit , continued to gain hardcourt confidence with a 6 - 4 7 - 6 victory over Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay . The Brazilian , runner - up in Montreal last month , took the second - set tie - break 7 - 5 and promptly prounounced himself a favorite at this final tune - up for the U . S . Open despite a strong field , which features nine top - 20 players . " When I win tie - breaks , I usually win tournaments , " the colorful Brazilian said . Sixth seed Thomas Enqvist got a bit of revenge with a 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory over fellow Swede Thomas Johansson . Earlier this year , Enqvist suffered a serious foot injury when he tripped over Johansson ' s racket bag . Chang looked to be having a surprisingly easy time with Medvedev as he raced out to a quick 5 - 1 lead in the first set . But the 21st - ranked Medvedev stormed back to force a tie - break . Medvedev saved four set points before he doublefaulted at 6 - 7 of the tie - break to hand Chang the set . " I think it was really important to get that first set , " said Chang , who improved his record against Medvedev to 6 - 1 . " Andre was really starting to roll . When players get into that kind of groove , they are hard to stop . " Chang broke Medvedev in the ninth game of the second set to go up 5 - 4 . But he fell behind 15 - 40 before an ace and a Medvedev backhand volley long brought the game back to deuce . Medvedev saved one match point by drilling a winner down the line and survived a second when Chang dumped a backhand into the net . On his third match point , Chang smacked a backhand pass down the line to close it out . " The difference is always deuce points and break points , " said Medvedev . " He ' s been doing this a little bit better than me . " Other than a few key points that went Chang ' s way , Medvedev said : " It was an even match as I saw it . " Fourth - ranked Goran Ivanisevic and Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov , whose ranking reached third in the world with his victory in New Haven Sunday , are scheduled to play their opening matches Tuesday .

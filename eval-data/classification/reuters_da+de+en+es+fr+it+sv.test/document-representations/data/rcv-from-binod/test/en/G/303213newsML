French garden gnome - snatchers declare truce . Gardeners in northwestern France can sleep easier at night - - masked raiders who have snatched more than 30 garden gnomes and " freed " them in nearby woods have declared a truce . Members of the self - styled Garden Gnomes Liberation Front , who operate in bands of seven in respect for Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , have suspended attacks until the spring because most owners have taken the statues inside for the winter , a local journalist reported . Jean - Marc Seigner , a reporter for a weekly in Alencon who met the gnome - snatchers in a forest , said he attended a ceremony at which they " liberated " about a dozen stolen gnomes . The Front claims to have snatched at least 30 of the brightly - coloured garden ornaments . If caught , the gnome - kidnappers risk up to a five - month suspended jail sentence and fines of up to 5 , 000 francs ( $ 930 ) . " The commandos have left the gnomes in a secret place all together in the woods . They seem to hope that if the gnomes are left alone they ' ll start building a cabin to live in , " Seigner said .

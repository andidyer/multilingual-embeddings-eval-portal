Commerce ' s Ehrlich - U . S . trade gap overstated - RFTV . Government data overstate the U . S . trade deficit and the magnitude of the problem is probably somewhere in the tens of billions of dollars per year , a senior Commerce Department official said Friday . " On an annual basis , we ' re probably talking tens of billions , not hundreds of billions , " Commerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich told Reuters Financial Television . Explaining the root of the problem , he pointed out , " We ' re not as good at counting our exports as we are our imports . " Most of the undercounting of exports stems from missing information on small exporters who don ' t file records on their transactions either because they do not know that they need to or because they are not obligated to do so , he said . Ehrlich , who was interviewed on the subject of flaws in the nation ' s statistics , was questioned about potential understatement of Gross Domestic Product growth . While agreeing that in the bigger picture , increases in GDP are most likely understated , Ehrlich said the statistics on the fourth quarter of last year could show growth in the area of 4 percent . " We might well have 4 percent growth in the fourth quarter . We ' ll find out next week , " Ehrlich said . The Commerce Department is scheduled to provide its advance , or first estimate , of fourth - quarter GDP on Jan . 31 . Assessing the statistics overall , the Commerce official stressed that difficulty measuring prices accounts for many of the problems , which he said mainly affect the longer - term view of the economy . Still , he said the data do provide a fairly accurate picture of where the economy is in the business cycle at any given point in time . " In the short term , our data our pretty good . In fact , they are probably the best in the world , " Ehrlich said . " That is , they are good at telling us : Is the economy growing ? Is it growing quickly or slowly ? Is that growth accelerating or decelerating ? " Because of that , Ehrlich said he did not think the deficiencies in the data would " profoundly " affect monetary or fiscal policy decisions in the short term . Nonetheless , he emphasized the shortcomings in capturing longer - term trends , such as the standard of living , the potential for economic growth and productivity growth rate , were a problem with implications for financial markets . " Over time , we ' re starting to move away from reality as we fail to keep up with a rapidly changing economy . That is the challenge , " he said . " If markets don ' t believe the information that we provide to them , the result is going to be more volatility , less adequate and confident performance in markets and that will hurt all participants in them and the economy at large as well , " he added .

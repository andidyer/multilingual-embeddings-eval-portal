HK protest ship skipper apologises for death . Weeping family members on Friday greeted the coffin of a Hong Kong activist leader who drowned in the East China Sea in an anti - Japan demonstration as the skipper of the protest vessel apologised for the tragedy . The body of David Chan was flown from Taiwan to Hong Kong , where his weeping wife and sister and other mourners bowed before the coffin on the airport tarmac . Chan drowned on Thursday after plunging into the sea to press home China ' s sovereignty over a group of islands claimed by Japan . Relatives and friends had draped a red communist Chinese flag with five golden stars over the yellow wooden coffin and gave three traditional bows in a simple airport mourning ceremony . British - ruled Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule next year . Mourners also draped cloth banners over the coffin with the words " Eternal Glory to Chan " and " Noble Patriot . " Ngai Lup - chee , captain of the rusty Kien Hwa 2 , which set sail for the islands on Sunday carrying the protesters and journalists , apologised to Chan ' s family . " I had promised before setting sail for the Diaoyu Islands that I would bring them back safely , " a weeping Ngai said in the airport building . " I failed . I brought one less person back . " Although there were so many Japanese vessels and planes , we still succeeded in getting within one mile of the Diaoyu islands , " the skipper said . " But I still feel I failed . " I didn ' t firmly oppose the request ( by protesters to leap off the ship into the sea ) , and I ' m sorry to David Chan and his family . " Chan led 18 Hong Kong Chinese activists to the islands northeast of Taiwan that the Chinese call the Diaoyus and Japan calls the Senkakus . Japanese coastguard boats thwarted the tanker ' s attempts to land on the isles , where the 18 had hoped to remove symbols of Japanese sovereignty , including a lighthouse . So they resorted to a protest dive . On the airport tarmac were groups of Hong Kong legislators , activists and well - wishers as well as a senior representative of China ' s de facto embassy in the territory . Activists on the tarmac held up banners with the slogans " Perished for your country " and " Your name will be remembered for a thousand years . " Groups of protesters gathered in the morning outside Japan ' s consulate , shouting " down with Japanese militarism " . One group of 50 demonstrators blamed Japan for Chan ' s death . " Maybe more and more people will die if they ( Japan ) don ' t stop their occupation of our territory , " said regional councillor Willie Cheng . " We look for peace . . . they started this not us . " Fellow activists stood in the airport holding flowers . " We will never give up the fight for the Diaoyu islands , " activist Lew Mon - hung shouted . Those who had made the ill - fated voyage stood silently behind Lew , too upset to join the chant . " If Chan dies in Chinese waters then it was worthwhile , but if he died in Japanese waters it is sad , and shame on the Chinese government , " said activist Wong Wai - ming .

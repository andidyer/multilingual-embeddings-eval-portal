TEPCO to buy more oil , gas as reactor use falls . Lower operating rates at Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc ' s ( TEPCO ) nuclear reactors will force it to buy an extra 18 billion yen worth of oil and gas for its thermal power plants , the company said on Thursday . " Our reactor utilisation rates are expected to average about 80 percent this fiscal year , compared with 84 . 1 percent last year , " a TEPCO spokesman said . The rate drop is mainly a result of a 300 - day closure of a 784 , 000 - kilowatt reactor at TEPCO ' s Fukushima No 1 nuclear power plant on the Pacific coast for major revamping , the spokesman said . The reactor was closed on May 26 . According to TEPCO , a one - percentage point drop in reactor operating rates reduces output by 1 . 2 billion kilowatt hours . It takes 4 . 5 billion yen worth of fuel per year to produce the same output at TEPCO ' s thermal power plants . The company said its total purchases of LNG , crude oil and fuel oil totalled to 534 billion yen in the last fiscal year which ended March 31 . The spokesman did not specify how much individual purchases of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) , fuel oil and crude oil would be increased . He said , however , that LNG was likely to play a major role in making up the expected production loss . TEPCO regards nuclear reactors and LNG - burning power plants as its primary production sources . Thermal power plants running on crude and fuel oil are considered auxiliary sources used during peak demand periods . TEPCO used 29 . 6 million barrels of fuel oil , 16 . 7 million barrels of crude oil and 14 . 7 million tonnes of LNG in the last fiscal year . - - Tokyo Energy Desk + 81 - 3 - 3432 - 8837

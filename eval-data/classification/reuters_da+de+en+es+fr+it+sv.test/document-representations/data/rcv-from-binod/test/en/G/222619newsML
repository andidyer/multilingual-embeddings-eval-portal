Argentina says Britain okays more war grave visits . Britain has agreed to let Argentine families who lost relatives in the Falklands War of 1982 visit their graves in the islands on January 20 and February 20 , the Argentine government said on Thursday . " We have agreed with Great Britain on visits by two groups of 16 mourners , who will go in January and February for two days , " Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella told reporters . " This seems to us to be only a small step forward , but positive . " Argentina has been appealing for more visits but many of the 2 , 000 inhabitants of the British - run territory still mistrust the country that briefly occupied them in 1982 and maintain a ban on entry by Argentine passport holders . About 1 , 000 servicemen , most of them Argentine , died in the bloody 10 - week war in which a British task force ousted Argentina ' s troops trying to enforce its sovereignty claim over the islands , which it calls the Malvinas . The Argentine cemetery , on a desolate headland , contains the graves of 255 Argentine soldiers , most of them conscripts . Relatives were able to visit for the first time only in 1991 , under the auspices of the International Red Cross . Di Tella , who has come under fire at home for his " charm offensive " aimed at the islanders , said he hoped visits by mourners would now be allowed " with a certain frequency and normality . "

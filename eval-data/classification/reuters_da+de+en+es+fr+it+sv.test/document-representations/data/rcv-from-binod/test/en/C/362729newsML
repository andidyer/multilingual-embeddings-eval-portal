S . Pickford , Core Lab to merge . British Oil engineering services firm Scott Pickford Plc and Core Laboratories of the U . S agreed to merge on Friday with Scott agreeing to the 59 pence - a - share bid offer from the American company . The offer values the issued share capital of Scott Pickford at around 8 . 9 million stg . Scott ' s decision to approve the bid offer ended a takeover fight which spanned three continents with Australia ' s Aerodata Holdings being the third player . Core had launched a hostile bid for control of Scott after the British and Australian companies had agreed on a partial share exchange at 40 pence for each Scott shares . Core ' s bid offer stalled the share swap briefly before a British court ordered the exchange to go ahead . Aerodata said on Friday that it would " accept Core Lab ' s offer in respect of all of the Scott Pickford shares held by it . . " . According to the swap deal the Australian firm was scheduled to buy 2 . 5 million of Scott ' s shares , representing a 20 percent stake . - - Arindam Nag , - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

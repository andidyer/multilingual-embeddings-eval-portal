Mexico stocks end up after shadowing Dow Jones . Mexican stocks extended mid - session gains to close sharply higher Thursday after a blue - chip rally in New York quelled local fears of a Wall Street meltdown , traders said . " Linkage with New York has not been direct for a while . What the rally there did was ease concerns that the bubble would burst and bring us down with them , " said a Mexico City based trader . The blue chip IPC index ended up 56 . 98 points , or 1 . 74 percent , at 3 , 330 . 14 . Volume , albeit inflated by cross trades , was heavy at 156 . 4 million shares traded . Traders said volume was heavier than for many recent sessions as foreign buyers stepped in during the session . On the broad market , of 105 stocks traded , gainers heavily outweighed losers by 64 to 17 . Tourism firm Situr headed the gainers , followed by its debt - stricken parent company Sidek , up three centavos ( 1 cent ) and five centavos ( 1 cent ) , respectively , at 39 centavos ( 5 cents ) and 73 centavos ( 9 cents ) . Traders noted the gains were technical rebounds and that both shares were trading at a fraction of their respective year highs of 3 . 12 pesos ( 40 cents ) and 4 . 30 pesos ( 55 cents ) . Traders also noted that financial stocks GFB and Banacci were in demand , both of which had seen debt ratings upgraded recently and had lagged behind the market , they said . GFB and Banacci gained 16 centavos ( 2 cents ) and 10 centavos ( 1 cent ) , respectively , to close at 3 . 24 pesos ( 41 cents ) and 16 . 10 pesos ( $ 2 . 05 ) . Most heavily traded loser was mining firm Camesa , off two centavos ( 1 cent ) at 3 . 47 pesos ( 44 cents ) , virtually all of which was accounted for by just one deal . Camesa ' s CFO said in a Reuters interview he expected the firm ' s net pre - tax profits rising by some 25 percent in 1997 .

Poland to consider Bradys conversion in 97 - minfin . The Polish Finance Ministry may consider next year converting the country ' s Brady bonds into other government paper , Krzysztof Kalicki , a deputy finance minister , said on Friday . " We should not rule out considering a Brady bond conversion next year but no decision has been made yet , " he told Reuters in an interview . He said that the 1997 budget bill being debated in parliamentary committees included a provision authorising the finance minister to carry out a conversion operation . @ Following its debt restructuring deal in 1994 with commercial bank creditors , Poland issued $ 8 . 2 billion worth of bonds in return for about $ 14 billion of debt . Three of the six bond issues have a collateral in 30 - year U . S . Treasury bonds with a par value of $ 4 . 8 billion and Kalicki said the conversion would allow Poland to free up the collateral . Kalicki said that Poland had yet to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of such an operation . @ " A partial effect ( of the conversion ) would be that we would free the collateral , but there also opinions that this operation would bring forward large debt servicing payments , " he said . The interest payments currently do not exceed $ 400 million annually but are expected to increase to $ 900 million around 2015 and fall to present levels later on . Kalicki said the final decision would depend on whether the conversion would allow a cut of the total cost of foreign debt servicing and repayment . - - Jacek Ramotowski + 48 22 653 9700

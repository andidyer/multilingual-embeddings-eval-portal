FOCUS - Italy ' s Eni and Enel seek electricity fusion . State - controlled energy group Eni and utility firm Ente Nazionale per l ' Energia Elettrica SpA plan to set up Italy ' s largest independent electricity production company which will be quoted on the world ' s bourses , the two Italian giants said on Monday . Eni and Enel said in a statement they had signed a letter of intent which they hoped would lead to the creation of the new enterprise before the end of 1997 . The outfit will produce cut - price electricity aimed at domestic and foreign markets . " The joint initiative should be seen as an independent , non - subsidised electricity firm also capable of competing at an international level , " the statement added . " The new company . . . will be floated on the main international stock exchanges . " It said the firm would have initial output capacity of 5 , 000 megawatts - - around a third of the amount of electricity which suppliers will be able to put on the market once Enel ' s distribution monopoly is ended . Italy ' s current second biggest electricity producer , the private company Edison , part of the Montedison group , has installed power of around 3 , 200 Megawatts . Parliament is debating when European Union legislation freeing up the electricity market should be introduced , with a decision expected by the end of the year . The joint venture will generate electricity in existing Enel and Eni plants , which will be converted to take advantage of the latest combined - cycle ( gas and coal ) technology . Eni will provide just under half the production capacity . " This technology will allow production at very competitive costs with limited emissions to the atmosphere , thus contributing to energy savings for the country whilst at the same time safeguarding the environment , " the statement said . The deal should also help solve a headache at Enel . The electricity utility has signed a $ 12 billion contract to buy 3 . 5 billion cubic metres of Nigerian natural gas a year for the next 25 years , but does not have the capacity in Italy to process all the gas and has asked to put the deal on hold . If it pulls out all together it will face a large forfeit , but it should be able to use much of the Nigerian gas in the joint venture once it goes into production . Industry sources said the new operation would go on line within 18 months of the final accord being signed . Eni managing director Franco Bernabe was quoted as saying at the weekend that Eni ' s goal was not to simply to enter the electric energy business " which in Italy is a saturated market " but to be able to supply the Eni group ' s oil refineries and chemical plants " with energy at a highly competitive cost . " Monday ' s statement said the combined - cycle plants would produce electricity at 65 lire ( four U . S . cents ) per kilowatt per hour . By contrast , Enel currently pays third party producers 118 . 6 lire per kilowatt per hour for the first eight years of the contract . Legislation for the liberalisation of the electricity market depends in part on how the government plans to sell - off Enel , with some specialists arguing that it should be split into its various production , distribution and transmission activities . Unions are fighting to keep the company in one piece . Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi last week declined to fix a precise date for the Enel privatisation , saying further technical surveys were needed . However he pledged to place a third tranche of Eni on the market by the summer . The sale is expected to reduce the Treasury ' s holding in the group to around 51 percent . $ = 1 , 712 lire

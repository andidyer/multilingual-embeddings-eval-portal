FOCUS - Sears to refund payments from some debtors . Sears , Roebuck and Co . said Thursday it will refund millions of dollars to some of it credit card holders who filed for bankruptcy but still made payments under agreements the retailer handled improperly . The nation ' s second largest retailer said the repayments , announced after the filing of a class - action lawsuit , may have a material impact on its 1997 earnings , but could not say how much of an impact that might be . Sears stock fell $ 3 . 625 to $ 47 . 25 Thursday and with more than 5 million shares traded was the second most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange . Analysts estimated the repayments could cost Sears at least $ 70 million in 1997 net income , but also stressed it was too early to quantify the impact on earnings . " They ( Sears officials ) don ' t know , " said Karen Sack , analyst at S & P Equity Group . " They can ' t quantify it until they do a full investigation . " The issue at hand is the retailer ' s efforts to persuade Sears credit card holders who filed for bankruptcy to continue making payments to Sears , rather than having the debt and their Sears credit wiped out in bankruptcy court . Sears also has been able to threaten debtors with repossession of products if they do not make payments . While Sears did not give a number for the impact on its profits , it said the effect could be material , which it later defined as anything over 5 percent of annual net income . Sears reported net income of $ 1 . 3 billion , or $ 3 . 12 a share , in 1996 . The 1997 earnings impact " could end up being 50 cents to $ 1 a share , and that ' s a lot , " said Peter Schaeffer , analyst at the Dillon , Read & Co . investment bank . The mean analysts ' estimate calls for earnings of $ 3 . 61 a share for Sears in 1997 , according to the First Call service , which tracks analyst forecasts . Schaeffer said he was lowering his recommendation on Sears to hold from buy until he got a better sense of how much the earnings impact would be . Sears has previously trumpeted to analysts its ability to reach these payment agreements , called reaffirmations , with holders of Sears credit cards . The reaffirmation agreements , however , also must be filed with the bankruptcy court , which Sears said Thursday it did not do properly . The company is now facing a class - action lawsuit filed by two debtors in Massachusetts over the credit card issues . Sears said in a statement " it exercised flawed legal judgment in the execution and handling of some debt reaffirmations . " The company said it has filed a voluntary restitution plan in a motion with U . S . Bankruptcy Court in Boston and was conducting a nationwide audit of the agreements . Sears said it reached about $ 400 million in reaffirmation agreements from 1992 through February 1997 . Sears said it has agreed to repay , with finance charges and interest , any improperly handled reaffirmations , and will also offer affected debtors a $ 100 gift certificate . Not all the reaffirmations were improperly filed . The repayments do not involve purchases made with other credit cards , including Discover , Visa and Mastercard . The company also said Thursday that same - store sales , or sales from stores open at least a year , rose 1 percent in March , slightly below estimates . But it was the credit card problem that was hurting the stock , analysts said . While the credit card repayment issue will affect earnings , analysts gave Sears high marks for taking the initiative in dealing with the problem . They contrasted this with problems Sears had earlier this decade in its automobile service unit that tarnished the company ' s reputation . " They spent three years trying to bring the Sears name back , " Sack said of the management team headed by Chief Executive Officer Arthur Martinez . " They ' re going to be doing everything they can now to make sure they maintain the name . "

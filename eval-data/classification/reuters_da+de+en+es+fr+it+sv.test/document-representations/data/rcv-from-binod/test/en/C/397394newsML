Halifax members in favour of conversion . Members of the Halifax Building Society , Britain ' s largest mortgage lender , voted in favour of converting the mutually - owned financial giant into a public company and floating it on the stock exchange , the chairman said on Monday . Halifax Chairman John Foulds said at a meeting of thousands of the Halifax ' s members that the conversion had already been approved through postal votes from the society ' s eight million account holders . Of the eight million Halifax members voting , more than 97 percent voted in favour of the conversion . For the investors ' resolution to be carried , 50 percent of those eligible to vote needed to do so and of these , 75 percent were needed to vote in favour . The flotation , expected to value the society at some 12 billion pounds ( $ 19 . 5 billion ) , is now expected to go ahead in June . Only just over 1 , 000 of the Halifax ' s members actually attended the meeting but many expressed dismay that the society was losing its mutual status and were assured by Foulds that the conversion would be in the best interests of its customers to become a bank .

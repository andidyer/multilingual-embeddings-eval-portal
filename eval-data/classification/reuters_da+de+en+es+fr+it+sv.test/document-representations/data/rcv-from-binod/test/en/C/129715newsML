France disallows Perclose reimbursements . Perclose Inc said second quarter results were hit by the deferral of about $ 500 , 000 related to shipments of products to its French distributor during the quarter . It said the deferral reflects a decision by the French national social security agency to disallow reimbursement to hospitals and clinics for the use of Perclose products . Because this is a recent development , Perclose said it has not been able to assess the impact on future sales in France . But it did say that it believes the ruling will " have an adverse impact on future sales in France and on company - wide sales . It said French sales have recently accounted for about 40 percent of total revenues and have been growing . Perclose makes suture - based closure devices for arterial access site management , which are used following diagnostic and therapeutic catheter procedures .

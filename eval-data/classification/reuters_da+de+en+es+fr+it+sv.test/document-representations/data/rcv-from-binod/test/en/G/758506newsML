BASEBALL - YANKEES ' IRABU IS HAMMERED BY MARINERS . The New York Yankees ' highly touted Japanese pitcher Hideki Irabu got another bitter taste of life in the major leagues Saturday when the Seattle Mariners drove him out of the game in just two innings . After posting an unearned run in the first , the Mariners tattooed Irabu ( 2 - 2 ) , who was bombed for the third consecutive start , in the second . Jose Cruz Jr cashed in a three - run homer and Alex Rodriguez added a two - run blast to make it 6 - 0 . Seattle went on to a 9 - 7 victory . Irabu was tagged for six runs - - five earned - - and four hits , walking one and striking out one . In his last three starts , he has lasted just a combined 13 2 / 3 innings , allowing 17 runs and 20 hits . " One thing that I learned today is that I have to relax , " Irabu said through an interpreter . " There was a lot of energy . I have to be more in control . Hats off to my opponent . They hit the ball well . " The seldom patient Yankee fans booed Irabu . " I did feel the boos because I am part of the New York Yankees , " the big righthander said , gesturing towards his heart . " He didn ' t look relaxed out there , " Yankees manager Joe Torre said of his starter . " He didn ' t look like he had good command or arm strength . When you have a couple of bad outings , you don ' t have the confidence and feel when you get out there . You have to let it fly . He looked like he was trying to be a little too precise . " " Irabu looked like he was adjusting to the major leagues , " said Seattle manager Lou Piniella . " Probably the expectations were too great . He has to settle down and pitch . He ' s got a good arm and will do better . " Suspicions have arisen that Irabu ' s arm has lost some of its liveliness , that his fastballs are slower and straighter than previously . " I was not surprised by what happened , but my performance was not up to expectations , " Irabu said . " I have no problem with my arm whatsoever . These are very good hitters , major league hitters , and if you make a mistake with the ball they will hit it out . " He was asked how he would feel if he lost his starter ' s role and was sent to the bullpen . " I have to pitch the same on the mound if I start , long relief , or close , it is the same on the mound , " he said . Catcher Joe Girardi said he thought Irabu actually pitched better than his previous outing , when he gave up six runs and seven hits in 6 - 2 / 3 innings in a 6 - 2 defeat by the Milwaukee Brewers , his first major - league defeat . " He made some good pitches , threw some good splitters , then hung one to Cruz , " said Girardi . " Rodriguez hit a 3 - 1 fastball . I thought he pitched better than in Milwaukee . He ' ll get better , everyone goes through this . "

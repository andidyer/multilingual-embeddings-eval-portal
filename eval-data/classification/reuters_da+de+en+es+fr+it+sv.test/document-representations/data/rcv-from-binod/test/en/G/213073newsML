HISTORY : Algeria , formerly part of Ottoman Empire , was invaded by France in 1830 and became a colony with more than one million French settlers . Guerrilla war launched by National Liberation Front ( FLN ) on November 1 , 1954 , led to independence proclaimed on July 5 , 1962 . Ahmed Ben Bella , one of the FLN ' s founding members , became Algeria ' s first president in elections held in 1963 . He was overthrown in July 1965 by the defence minister , Colonel Houari Boumedienne , who accused him of demagogy and inefficiency . Colonel Chadli Benjedid was chosen by FLN and army leaders as Algeria ' s third president in 1979 after Boumedienne ' s death in December 1978 . Re - elected for five - year terms in 1984 and 1988 . Chadli eased political repression , but after oil prices fell in 1986 was increasingly forced to implement austerity . FLN era began to unravel with nationwide riots in October 1988 . At least 159 people were killed before the army restored order . To help quell the riots Chadli promised multi - party democracy . The first round of general elections , held on December 26 , 1991 , gave the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) an overwhelming lead . To take power it needed only 28 more seats from run - off voting set for January 16 , 1992 . Chadli resigned on January 11 , 1992 . Diplomats said he was forced out by army officers . A group of military and political leaders took over and scrapped the half - finished election . They named a five - man High Council of State as collective presidency , headed by Mohamed Boudiaf . The authorities declared a state of emergency on February 9 and court orders dissolution of the FIS on March 4 , 1992 . Boudiaf was assassinated in the eastern town of Annaba on Monday , June 29 . The presidency named Ali Kafi , a colonel from the war of independence against France , as head of state . After trial by a military court in Blida , south of Algiers , FIS leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj were jailed for 12 years for subversion . Shooting erupted in Algiers , and clashes broke out round mosques after subsequent mass Friday prayers . Armed force , arrests and the closing of some mosques slowly ended the Friday street violence . Attacks switched to ambushes of police and gendarmerie patrols and against individuals , including intellectuals , doctors and journalists . A night curfew , special courts , more security and , in January 1993 the first executions of Moslem fundamentalists , appeared to have no impact on the violence . Sabotage and instability have affected the economy , already battered by falling oil prices , and heavy repayments on foreign debt run up in decades of centralised economic management . Attacks on foreigners sparked an exodus of thousands , particularly French . More than 100 foreign nationals have been killed , with most of their deaths attributed to the ruthless Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) , a finally - autonomous offshoot of FIS . Ali Kafi stepped down as president at the end of 1994 and a retired general , Liamine Zeroual , was named president . On November 16 1995 , Zeroual returns to power after his victory in the country ' s first plural presidential poll . In April , 1996 , Zeroual resumes marathon - dialogue with legal opposition leaders to forge consensus over his reforms to change the constitution , hold general and local elections in 1997 . On September 15 , 38 political and union leaders sign pact endorsing Zeroual reforms . Main secular opposition parties stay away accusing the Algerian leader of seeking to forge an " anti - Islamist front " rather than a peaceful solution . Early in October , Zeroual announces the referendum will take place on November 28 urging Algerians to support the vote to help restore peace and ensure a " future for their sons " .

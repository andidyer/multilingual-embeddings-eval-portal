Rebels demand talks with Mobutu before ceasefire . Zairean rebels demanded on Thursday negotiations with President Mobutu Sese Seko before a ceasefire and France urged its nationals to leave Zaire and sent troops and aircraft to the region . Kakudji Gaetan , rebel commissioner for foreign affairs , said the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo - Zaire insisted a ceasefire can only follow direct talks . " We are ready for negotiations at any time and we have always said so . If the rest of the world wants that , then they should put pressure on the other side , not just on us , " Kakudji told Reuters at rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Goma . African leaders meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday with Zaire ' s prime minister called for an immediate ceasefire to pave the way for negotiations to end six months of fighting in east Zaire . In Paris , a defence ministry spokesman said France has sent aircraft and about 100 troops to Congo and Gabon in case it has to protect or evacuate its nationals from neighbouring Zaire . " Given the situation , and in order to ensure the safety of our citizens if necessary , the Ministry of Defence has decided to sent extra resources to Libreville and Brazzaville , " he said . The French foreign ministry recommended French citizens whose presence was not essential to leave temporarily because of " the uncertainty linked to the current situation in Zaire " . Officials said France had sent three transport planes - - two C160 Transals and a C130 Hercules - - and two Puma helicopters to Libreville with 40 extra soldiers . The other 60 soldiers would go on to Brazzaville , across the Zaire river from Kinshasa . Rebels have captured more than one fifth of Africa ' s third largest country , including its third - biggest city , Kisangani , sparking unrest and fears of violence or a coup in Kinshasa . In southern France , Mobutu ' s son and spokesman said his father would return to Kinshasa on Friday to seek a solution to Zaire ' s deepening crisis . Mobutu has previously said he would crush the rebels . The 66 - year - old president , released from a Monaco hospital on Wednesday after further cancer treatment , failed to appear at a planned photo session . His son , Mobutu Nzanga , said he was too busy . " He is going to the capital tomorrow . His intention is to find a solution to the present crisis in consultation with parliament , the government and the military high command , " Mobutu Nzanga told Reuters . He said Mobutu did not rule out talks with rebels but would first discuss the issue with political leaders in Kinshasa . Rebel leader Laurent Kabila says he will only agree to a ceasefire after negotiations with Mobutu , or someone appointed by him , on how Zaire ' s ruler for 32 years would step down . Speaking after talks with South African President Nelson Mandela , U . N . Secretary - General Kofi Annan said the U . N . Security Council would consider sending a peace monitoring force to Zaire if both warring sides agreed to a ceasefire . He said he was hopeful a proposed summit in Lome , Togo , on March 26 would bring the government and Kabila ' s rebels closer . He said both sides had indicated in preliminary talks with mediators they would look for U . N . help to monitor a ceasefire . " It is not excluded , if there were to be a ceasefire agreement signed by the parties and if it were to hold , that the U . N . would put in peacekeepers to monitor it , " Annan said . A Ugandan government minister called on Wednesday for the public lynching of Mobutu for neglecting his army and having had to fire foreign mercenaries , who failed to stem rebel advances . The rebel force is dominated by ethnic Tutsis , some of them Zairean Banyamulenge Tutsis and others said by intelligence sources to be members of Rwanda ' s Tutsi - dominated army . The Rwandan government denies any involvement with the rebels . Demobilised Ugandan troops , hired on contract , are also part of the rebel force . Kabila is a Zairean non - Tutsi from Shaba and his field commanders are a mixture of Zaireans and foreigners .

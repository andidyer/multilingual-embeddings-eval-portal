Russian GDP , industrial output shrank in 1996 . Russian gross domestic product fell by six percent last year and output shrank in every sector of the economy , according to figures released on Monday . The figures , from the State Statistics Committee , showed that the electricity and energy sectors showed the smallest decline with falls of two and three percent respectively . But output fell a steep 28 percent in light industries and 25 percent in the building sector . Industrial output fell five percent overall . Russian industrial output has more than halved since 1992 , when the country launched a reform programme aimed at transforming a centrally planned economy into a market system modelled on that in the West . Russian official data tends to under - report a growing private sector , although officials have made big efforts to improve government statistics . Officials say the long - awaited economic turnaround could come this year , but economists say this depends on tough decisions being made during the course of the year to restructure the economy , raise prices for heavily subsidised housing and bankrupt ailing firms . Hard - hit sectors include the defence industries , where the cash - strapped military has been unable to afford new equipment , and firms making automobiles and consumer goods , which face tough competition from imported goods . Analysts say the bright spot in the economic picture is a steep fall in inflation , which tumbled below 22 percent in the year to December , from 131 percent in the year to December 1995 . The government expects inflation of around 12 percent this year . Interest rates on GKO Treasury bills have fallen from peaks of almost 200 percent before the presidential election in the summer to current levels around 35 percent . - - Janet Guttsman , Moscow Newsroom , + 7095 941 8520

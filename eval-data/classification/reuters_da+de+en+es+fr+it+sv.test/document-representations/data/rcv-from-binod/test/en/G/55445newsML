Hijackers seize bus in southern Russia - agency . Hijackers seized a bus on Monday in the capital of the southern Russian region of Dagestan , which neighbours Chechnya , RIA news agency said . RIA quoted Dagestan interior ministry chief - of - staff Sultan Gantilov as saying the hijackers were two Chechens and that they were heading for the airport of the capital , Makhachkala . It did not mention hostages or give other details . Dagestan was the scene of a dramatic hostage - taking by Chechen rebels last January , when Salman Raduyev ' s " Lone Wolf " group took hundreds of hostages in the town of Kizlyar . Raduyev and most of his guerrillas made it back across the Chechen border after holding out at the Dagestani village of Pervomaiskoye for more than a week , including several days under a massive Russian air and artillery bombardment . A fragile peace is holding in Chechnya following a ceasefire and peace deal between Moscow and Chechen separatists arranged at the end of last month . Before the war broke out there in December 1994 , there were a number of incidents in which Chechens hijacked buses in neighbouring regions for ransom money .

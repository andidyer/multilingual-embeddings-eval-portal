Indonesia ruling party pleased over conference . Indonesia ' s ruling Golkar party said on Wednesday it had sent a letter to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , expressing gratitude for the break - up of an East Timor conference in Kuala Lumpur last weekend . " The clear action is a reflection the relationship between Indonesia and Malaysia is indeed going ahead well and in a positive way . We are not interfering in the problems of each nation , " Golkar General Chairman Harmoko told the state - run TVRI television . A youth mob allied to the Malaysian government smashed into the Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor II in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday , overturning furniture and manhandling participants . The conference was called to draw international attention to the plight of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor , which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year , a move never recognised by the United Nations . The Malaysian government had objected to the conference , saying it could harm ties with neighbouring Indonesia , but stopped short of banning it . A Malaysian court on Wednesday ordered 10 local human rights activists to spend another three days in jail so police could continue investigating the break - up of the event . The 10 were among 13 Malaysian activists still in jail after the incident . Some 56 Malaysian activists and journalists have been released from jail this week following the disruption and another 46 foreign participants were deported . Seven of the youth group demonstrators were detained on Saturday . All were released a few hours later .

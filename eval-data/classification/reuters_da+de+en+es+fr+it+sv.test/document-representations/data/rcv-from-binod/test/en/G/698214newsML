TENNIS - RELAXED STICH AIMS TO END ON WIMBLEDON HIGH . Former champion Michael Stich is set to end his Wimbledon career on a high after he knocked out accomplished doubles player Mark Woodforde in four sets on Tuesday . The lofty German , who has said he will retire at the end of this season , looked relaxed and confident as he claimed his place in the quarter - finals by beating Australian Woodforde 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 3 7 - 5 . At 4 - 3 up in the fourth set , he briefly lost concentration and hit a few volleys into the net , sacrificing his serve . But despite losing the next game , there was little sign of the shoulder problem which plagued him during Sunday ' s match against Australian Sandon Stolle , and he comfortably took the following three games and the match , breaking Woodforde ' s serve to love . " Today the shoulder was good . It didn ' t bother me too much on my serve , " he reported afterwards . Stich said his decision to quit the game had not relaxed him or enhanced his performance . " I didn ' t come here relaxed , not expecting anything . I expected to do well and to play well , " he said . " It has nothing to do with retiring . It just has a lot to do with me trying as well as I can in this tournament right now . " " To win is the best way to finish it , " he added . Stich won the title in 1991 by beating compatriot Boris Becker but has had mixed success since then , exiting the tournament in the first round in both 1994 and 1995 . He will face a tough quarter - final tussle against either last year ' s champion Richard Krajicek or British hope Tim Henman . " It won ' t be easy if I play Tim Henman on centre court but no matches are easy , " Stich said .

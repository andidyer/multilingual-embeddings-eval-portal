Wall Street cautious on Bay plans . Bay Networks Inc released a detailed road map of its future product plans Tuesday , giving the company a solid groundwork for its ongoing turnaround , Wall Street analysts who attended a two - hour briefing here with company executives said . But analysts leaving the meeting said they still were waiting for further evidence that Bay is ready to execute its new strategies - - including several quarters of healthy results - - before they consider it back on track . " This is all marketing stuff right now , " A . G . Edwards analyst T . Peter Andrew said of Bay ' s product plans . " This is not a revenue generator that ' s going to affect the next quarter or two , " he said . " Time will tell , " Bear Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said . " We think the company in general is making progress , but we will have to wait and see results , " Blachno said . Both analysts maintain neutral ratings on Bay . But Andrew said he may be re - evaluating his view of the stock in light of recent positive developments at Bay , but that he had not decided to alter his position yet . Wall Street has shied away from the one - time networking powerhouse after repeated management miscues and product delays caused it to lose market share , leading to poor financial reports in the last three quarters that left brokers in doubt about Bay ' s future . But , beginning six months ago , Bay began making dramatic changes , starting with the hiring of ex - Intel Corp executive David House as its new chairman and chief executive . Under his guidance , Bay has carried out a management house - cleaning and internal restructuring . Earlier Tuesday , Bay revealed a new transitional product strategy it calls " Adaptive Networking " - - that is designed to make the plumbing of Internet - based networks easier to upgrade to the higher - speed networks . The briefing took place in the midst of Networld + Interop , the network industry trade show taking place here this week . Furman Selz analyst Martin Pyykkonen , who also attended the Bay meeting , said he came away convinced the company has a defensible strategy that will permit it to see healthy growth in coming years , although at rates that are somewhat slower than key rivals . He projected the company will see revenue growth during fiscal 1998 in the range of 15 to 16 percent and around 20 percent in fiscal 1999 . " It ' s not a bolt of lightning or a reinvention of the industry , " he said of the new product strategy . By contrast , industry giant Cisco Systems Inc has for several years managed to terrify its competitors by reporting revenue growth of faster than 50 percent year - over - year .

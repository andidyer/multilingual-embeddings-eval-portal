Higher yen lures Japanese investors to stocks . Prompted by a higher yen , Japanese institutional investors plan to boost stock weightings and reduce weightings in cash and bonds , a Reuters investment survey showed on Friday . Seeing the yen as more likely to weaken than strengthen , investors said the yen ' s current appreciation meant that now was the time to buy , especially with stock markets around the world doing well . The dollar has slid about eight percent since early May to around 116 yen . The weighting for stocks rose in most markets except for France and Asia , with the overall share weighting rising 2 . 08 percentage points to 47 . 08 percent . The weighting for bonds continued on a gradual downward trend which began in January this year , slipping 0 . 83 point to 38 . 50 percent . The cash weighting fell 1 . 25 points to 14 . 42 percent . Reuters ' Global Asset Allocation survey polled 16 financial institutions based in Japan in late May about their investment strategies for June . Investors said currency movements would be the major factor influencing their portfolios in the future . " We can ' t be too careful about forex rates . Currencies will fluctuate around the Denver ( Group of Seven ) summit in late June and monetary conferences in September . Investment performance will depend greatly on the timing of deals in foreign securities , " said Nikko Research Center . The shift to shares is particularly evident in the German and Japanese markets , with the German market weighting gaining almost a full percentage point since January . Stocks at home were seen as having had their fill of sharp rises in late May and are expected to be more subdued next month , although investors said the Nikkei average was on a rising trend in the medium term . The equities weighting for North America also rose by 0 . 49 point from the previous survey to 40 . 53 percent , the first rise in four months . Although some saw a bumpy period for the Dow in June , most expected the New York market to maintain its upward trend . " The Dow will continue to rise as the slight downturn in indicators for April has been interpreted as a reaction to growth of 5 . 6 percent in the January to March period . A quarter point rate rise is likely at the next FOMC , " said Tokyo Research . Investors said they had lowered their bond weightings in the United States and raised them slightly at home due to the increased foreign exchange risk that a higher yen brought . Weighting for U . S . Treasuries declined 0 . 11 point to stand at 38 . 65 percent , while the Japanese market rose 0 . 27 point to 14 . 18 percent . " The domestic bond market is weak , with little demand and supply and on expectations of higher rates . But to avoid higher investment risk on the back of a stronger yen , we have raised our weighting temporarily , " said Dowa Kasai Investment Management .

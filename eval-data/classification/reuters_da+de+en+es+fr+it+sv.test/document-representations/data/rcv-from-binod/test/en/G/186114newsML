Thousands homeless in S . Peru after quake kills 7 . Tens of thousands of people slept in the streets on Wednesday after their houses were destroyed by an earthquake that hit southern Peru on Tuesday , killing seven people and injuring at least 500 . The hardest hit towns were along the Pacific coast , at Nazca , 290 miles ( 460 km ) south of the capital Lima , where 300 were injured and Ica , 100 miles ( 160 km ) further north , where another 200 were injured , Peruvian officials said . By early on Wednesday , Nazca had felt at least 100 aftershocks of the quake that shook southern Peru and rocked Lima for a minute , said Luis Vilca of the Peruvian Geophysic Institute . Army and police flew into Nazca scores of tents , hundreds of blankets and food after the quake destroyed 25 , 000 of the town ' s homes , according to mayor Luz Torres Zegarra . Most of the estimated population of 40 , 000 - - left without light , water or working telephone lines - - had hauled their belongings into the streets . Some knelt out in the cool night and prayed for an end to the aftershocks . The U . S . Geological Survey said the quake measured 7 . 3 on the Richter scale and its epicentre was 65 miles ( 100 km ) southeast of Ica . John Minch , geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Centre in Golden , Colorado , said the quake occurred at noon local time ( 1700 GMT ) on Tuesday . " It was intense . We had to fly - - all of us . The roof of our house practically fell on top of us . There ' s so much damage , " said a devastated Adrian Contreras . Officials said they believed Tuesday ' s early reports were false that 300 workers were trapped in an underground mine at the " Huanca " gold mine , 310 miles ( 500 km ) south of Lima , on the border of the southern departments of Ica and Ayacucho . " Earlier we had reported 300 trapped but this now appears to have been one of the many false alarms of the day , " said Jorge Rodriguez , a police doctor in Ayacucho . Col . Lucio Corpuera , a Civil Defence official in Lima , said rescue workers had not arrived at the mine . However , the latest information indicated that only 30 miners were injured in the area in a bus crash after the highway split open . But Corpuera said it would not be possible to confirm definitively that there were no trapped workers in the mine until around 6 a . m . local time ( 1100 GMT ) , when the first helicopters were expected to reach Huanca . Five of the deaths caused by the earthquake occurred in Nazca , where 40 percent of the houses suffered serious damage . Two children and one teenager died from head wounds caused by falling debris and two men were killed when a landslide demolished homes in one of Nazca ' s many shanty towns , according to army Gen . Rolando Quezada . A man in neighbouring Ica died of a heart attack brought on by the earthquake , Corpuera said . In Acari , near Peru ' s second city , Arequipa , 640 miles ( 1 , 030 km ) south of Lima , a 60 - year old woman died in the quake , Corpuera added , without giving more details . In Nazca , medical staff attended a further 120 injured people , 40 of whom were still in a serious condition , added Fermin Caceres , director of the Nazca hospital . Jose Amado , 62 , who lay in a hospital bed with a fractured leg , said he had grabbed his three daughters and dragged them out of their house just before it collapsed into the street . " This is the second time I ' ve only just got out of a quake alive , " he said , adding his father had saved him from a falling building in nearby Acari more than 50 years ago . The quake had caused the collapse of several other small mines in the Ica and Ayacucho departments , seriously injuring at least four people , according to local mining unions and rescue workers , Corpuera said . Nazca is one of Peru ' s main tourist attractions for its mysterious pre - Inca lines that form patterns in the desert that can be seen only from the air . The Andean country is prone to frequent seismic activity . On May 31 , 1970 , an earthquake measuring 7 . 8 in magnitude , leveled scores of towns and caused an ice - and mud - slide that killed 67 , 000 people .

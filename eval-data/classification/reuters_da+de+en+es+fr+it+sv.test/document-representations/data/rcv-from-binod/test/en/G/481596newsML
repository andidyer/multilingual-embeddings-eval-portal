Netanyahu says no peace if bombs keep exploding . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday Israel would not resume peacemaking as long as Palestinian bombs kept exploding . He spoke hours after a petrol bomb was thrown at an Israeli bus in the West Bank causing it to overturn and wounding eleven soldiers . It was the third bombing Israel blamed on Palestinians in two days . " The peace process can ' t be conducted while busses or cafes are exploding or while children or in danger of a terrorist blowing them up , " Netanyahu told reporters as unrest in the West Bank , touched off by Israeli settlement construction , entered a third week . His spokesman vowed settlement building would continue . Palestinians complain Jewish settlement on occupied land pre - empts the results of final peace talks yet to come on the status of Arab East Jerusalem , captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by both sides . Arabs want settlement to top the agenda when Netanyahu meets President Bill Clinton next week for peace - saving talks but the Israeli leader said halting the violence was the first priority . " We will discuss the urgent need for the Palestinian Authority to start battling terrorism because without it we won ' t be able to move forward in the process and it will get stuck quickly , " he said . Asked if he would face U . S . pressure over his settlement policy , Netanyahu said : " We are not operating in such a climate . I think there ' s a deep understanding between Israel and the U . S . today and we both see eye to eye . " U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Palestinian President Yasser Arafat twice on Wednesday to hear his views ahead of Netanyahu ' s visit , the Palestinian official news agency Wafa said . Wafa quoted Arafat as telling Albright : " The Israeli settlement policy . . . places the entire peace process in real danger . " He said later only a halt in settlement building would calm the situation . Palestinian stone - throwers early on Wednesday clashed north of Jersualem with soldiers who responded with teargas and rubber bullets . " The building at Har Homa will continue , " Netanyahu ' s spokesman Shai Bazak said . " He ( Netanyahu ) will say that to Clinton . He has said that to the whole world and he will say it again . Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and we have the right to build in it . " Clinton , involved in Israeli - PLO deals since the first was signed at the White House in 1993 , pledged to get involved again on Tuesday when he met Jordan ' s King Hussein in Washington . " I ' m prepared personally to do anything I can to get this process back on track and move it forward , " Clinton said . In the PLO - ruled Gaza Strip on Tuesday , two Palestinians were killed in explosions that Israel said were botched suicide bombings by the Islamic Jihad group aimed at Jewish school children . Jihad sources said the Palestinian Authority had arrested 30 of their activists in overnight raids . But the group disavowed the two bombings , charging that Israel had staged them to divert attention from its settlement policy . " The Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine denies any responsibility for the two suspected explosions yesterday and has no link at all to them , " Islamic Jihad leader in Gaza Sheikh Abdallah al - Shami said .

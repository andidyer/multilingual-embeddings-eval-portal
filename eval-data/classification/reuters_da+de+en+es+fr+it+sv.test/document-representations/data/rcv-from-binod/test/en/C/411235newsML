Ford accelerates plan to mothball T - bird - analysts . Ford Motor Co . has decided to accelerate plans to mothball the Thunderbird but will redesign the fabled coupe , taking it back to its roots as a two - seat roadster , industry analysts said Friday . Officials at Ford declined to comment on reports the car will be taken off the market at the end of this year for the first time since 1954 . But Ford spokesman Jim Bright pointed out two realities the nation ' s No . 2 automaker faces : sales of mid - sized two - door cars like the Thunderbird are declining whle Ford is searching for more capacity to boost production of light trucks . " Obviously , we ' re making changes to be able to give customers the products they want and need , " he said . At the same time , Bright sought to calm the hundreds of concerned Thunderbird enthusiasts who have deluged the company with calls since published reports surfaced about the car ' s possible demise . " It ' s a name that ' s hard to imagine Ford Motor Co . ever abandoning , " he said . " We just have too much equity in it to think about walking away from it . " Nevertheless , analysts said Ford has been planning for some time to discontinue the current Thunderbird and its sister Mercury Cougar because of lagging sales . Originally , Ford planned to halt Cougar production at the end of 1997 and update the Thunderbird for the 1998 model year . But recently , the automaker told suppliers to stop their work on the 1998 update because Ford had decided to stop Thunderbird production at the same time as the Cougar . " All they ' ve done here is pull up the date by about 18 months for the Thunderbird , " said Christopher Cedergren , managing director of Nextrend , an automotive consulting firm in Thousand Oaks , Calif . Cedergren said the date of the next - generation Thunderbird is still vague , although it could come as early as 2000 . The new car will be produced in smaller numbers and harken back to the original 1955 Thunderbird two - seat model . Back seats were added in later models . First introduced to combat General Motors Corp . ' s Corvette , the Thunderbird became a symbol of Detroit ' s golden age and remains a nostalgic favourite for car buffs . Sales of the Thunderbird and Cougar have been falling steadily as buyers opted for four - door cars and sport / utility vehicles . Thunderbird sales last year were 79 , 721 , compared to 352 , 751 in its best year in 1978 . Orders for the car are still sluggish . Ford has idled the car line for two weeks starting March 3 . The suspension comes after four previous down weeks since the first of this year . Analysts said it was not suprising that Ford ' s decision came five months after it promoted Jacques Nasser , an aggressive cost - cutter , to head its core automotive unit . " Nasser is not the type of gentleman who is going to let losses continue , " said one analyst who asked not to be named . The Thunderbird decision increases the uncertainty for the approximatley 1 , 800 hourly employees who work on the car line at Ford ' s assembly plant in Lorain , Ohio . Industry sources have said Ford may close or sell the plant once production of the two cars is halted . However , Nasser has said that Ford will spend more on its light truck products - - minivans , sport / utilities and pickup trucks - - because that is where profits are fattest . Cedergren said Ford may use the plant for another light truck product . " Although no one is sure what ' s going to happen except Ford , what is clear is the plant is definitely going to be utilized , " he said .

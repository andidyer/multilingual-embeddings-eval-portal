SOCCER - REALITY TAKES OVER FROM DREAMING IN EUROPEAN CUP . The European Champions ' League this week reaches the point of no return where mathematical certainties take the place of dreams and hopes . Juventus , the reigning European champions , and Manchester United - - despite conceding 11 goals in their last two matches - - should clinch their places in the last eight by ensuring they finish in the top two positions in Group C with wins over Rapid Vienna and injury - hit Fenerbahce respectively . Borussia Dortmund will also guarantee their place in the quarter - finals from Group B if they complete the double over Atletico Madrid at home , while Porto will virtually ensure top spot in Group D if they follow up their away win over Rosenborg with a home victory . Rosenborg striker Jahn Ivar " Mini " Jakobsen will miss Wednesday ' s match after being sent off two weeks ago in Trondheim where Porto won 1 - 0 . Also doubtful is Rosenborg captain Bent Skammerlsrud , who is reluctant to leave home because his partner is just about to have a baby . AC Milan must recover from their surprise 2 - 1 defeat in Gothenburg two weeks ago with a victory over the Swedish champions to banish serious doubts about their chances of advancing from Group D with Porto . Until this week Rangers and Widzew Lodz , who have both lost all their matches in groups A and B respectively , have been hoping for a dramatic change in fortune - - and unlikely results elsewhere - - to keep alive their hopes of progressing . But their interest in the competition is almost certain to end after Wednesday ' s matches against Ajax and Steaua Bucharest respectively . Group A features Ajax , Grasshopper and Auxerre on six points and Rangers on none , with Ajax leading on goal difference . Ajax travel to face a Glasgow outfit missing three suspended players - - Paul Gascoigne , skipper Richard Gough and Australian Craig Moore as well as injured first - choice goalkeeper Andy Goram - - and should add three more points to the ones they picked up when they beat Rangers 4 - 1 in Amsterdam two weeks ago . Auxerre will be without young striker Thomas Deniaud for their vital match against Grasshopper in Switzerland . Deniaud , who scored twice against Glasgow Rangers and once against Grasshopper in Auxerre ' s last two European ties , hurt his ankle after scoring the opening goal in his side ' s 7 - 0 thrashing of Lyon on Friday and will be out of action for six weeks . Grasshopper will be out for a revenge after narrowly losing 1 - 0 at Auxerre and looking forward to a win which would practically give them a place in the quarter - finals . While Turkish champions Fenerbahce will lose their tenuous foothold in the Champions ' League if they are beaten by Manchester United and Juventus defeat Rapid Vienna , their Istanbul rivals Galatasaray travel to European Cup Winners ' Cup holders Paris St Germain in a very strong position . Galatasaray won the first leg of their second - round tie 4 - 2 in Istanbul two weeks ago and will be full of confidence after winning 8 - 1 in Izmir against Altay on Sunday . That victory follows a recent 6 - 1 win over Gaziantepspor and coach Fetih Terim believes they can keep up their high scoring in France . " I believe we can put on another overwhelming performance in France and go through to the next round , " he said . In the UEFA Cup , Internazionale , bidding to win the trophy for the third time in seven seasons , will be looking to follow up their 3 - 1 home win against Parma on Sunday with a win over Casino Graz of Austria . Inter were unimpressive winning the first leg 1 - 0 in Austria two weeks ago and are unlikely to underestimate their opponents again . They will field their full - strength side against the Austrians , which includes Ciriaco Sforza of Switzerland , Englishman Paul Ince , Argentine Javier Zanetti , Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff and Chilean Ivan Zamorano , who scored twice against Parma . Tensions are likely to be running high in Newcastle , where the English team - - without 15 million pounds ( $ 24 million ) world record signing Alan Shearer who is recovering from a groin operation - - attempt to overcome a 3 - 2 first leg deficit against Ferencvaros of Hungary . Newcastle , who have spent more than 50 million pounds ( $ 80 million ) on new players in the last four seasons , are eager to maintain their push for their first trophy since winning the old Inter Cities Fairs Cup against Hungarians Ujpest Dosza in 1969 . The English side find themselves trailing after gifting Ferencvaros three goals with sloppy defending in Budapest but their England striker Les Ferdinand , whose goal two weeks ago sparked a Newcastle comeback , is confident the first - leg deficit can be overturned . " It ' s very delicately balanced and we can ' t go out all guns blazing , " he said . " We just need the one goal and if we can get it and hold them we ' ll go through . "

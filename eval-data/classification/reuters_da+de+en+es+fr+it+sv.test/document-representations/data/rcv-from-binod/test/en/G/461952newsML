ATHLETICS - TERGAT STAYS KING OF CROSS - COUNTRY . Kenyan Paul Tergat completed a cross - country world championship hat - trick on Sunday as he outsprinted Morocco ' s Salah Hissou over the final 500 metres . Ethiopia ' s Derartu Tulu regained the women ' s crown she won two years ago . Both winners collected $ 40 , 000 . " This was the hardest of my three victories . " said Kenyan Air Force sergeant Tergat . He covered the 12 . 333 km course in 35 minutes 11 seconds . " Possibly the toughest race I have ever had . " His compartiot Thomas Nyariki led for much of the race , pulling away after just two kilometres . At one stage he had an advantage of 13 seconds but with about three kilometres to go Hissou and Tergat started to close the gap . The pair overtook the flagging Nyariki in the final kilometre before embarking on a fierce duel for victory . Hissou finished second in 35 : 13 while Nyariki hung on for third in 35 : 20 . Hissou , the 10 , 000 metres world record holder , criticised the Kenyan tactics of trying to intimidate him during the race by crowding around him . " I had to fight against a group of Kenyans . That ' s why I started to chase after Nyariki when he had the lead , " said Hissou . " If Tergat followed me I knew I would then only have to fight one Kenyan rather than four . " The incident was just the latest in a long rivalry between Kenyan and Moroccan distance runners . In the past , Morocco ' s Khalid Skah has accused Kenyan runners of using similar tactics . Skah had an infamous battle with Kenya ' s Richard Chelimo over 10 , 000 metres at the 1992 Olympics when Hammou Boutayeb , a lapped Moroccan runner , speeded up to assist Skah and impede Chelimo . Kenya , who had five men in the top seven on Sunday , won the team title for the 12th successive year . Tulu won the women ' s 6 . 7 km race in 20 : 53 . Although her two seconds margin of victory was the same as Tergat ' s , her success was achieved in a quite different way . Briton Paula Radcliffe and defending champion Gete Wami of Ethiopia seemed to be clear of the pack and fighting between themselves for the gold medal on the final circuit around Turin ' s Parco Del Valentino . But Tulu produced a late charge to consign her two opponents to silver and bronze respectively . " I have not done any speed work so I knew I was going to have to build up gradually , " Tulu explained . " I did not know whether I could catch them in time . Winning here makes up a little bit for last year in Cape Town when I expected to win but lost a shoe and finished fourth . " Radcliffe finished in 20 : 55 with Wami a further five seconds back . Tulu added to her medal haul by leading Ethiopia to the women ' s team title .

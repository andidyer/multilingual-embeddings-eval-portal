RTRS - Goodman sees slower margarine market . Australasian food group Goodman Fielder Ltd said on Thursday it expected the margarine and edible oils market would flatten and eventually fall off in the medium term as the health trend away from fats continued . Goodmans ' edible oils division increased sales to A $ 554 . 4 million in 1995 / 96 from A $ 501 . 2 million and raised profits by 32 percent to A $ 41 . 1 million against this long term trend . Goodman chief executive David Hearn said a 70 percent increase in marketing in 1995 / 96 had helped boost the overall market , but this trend was unlikely to continue . " The reality is that the macro food trend is that the edible oils sector in retail terms is under some pressure as people try to cut out some fat from their diet , " Hearn said . " It would be foolish to say that trend would reverse , " he said . " The retail margarine sector is on a world - wide health trend basis likely to show flat to marginally down performance , " he said . Earlier Goodmans reported a group net profit of A $ 28 . 3 million for the year to June 30 compared with a loss of A $ 52 . 8 million a year earlier . Goodman ' s pre - abnormals net profit rose 3 . 5 percent to A $ 100 . 7 million , in line with analysts expectations of around A $ 100 million . Goodman ' s shares were down one cent at A $ 1 . 29 at 1 . 20 p . m . ( 0320 GMT ) . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

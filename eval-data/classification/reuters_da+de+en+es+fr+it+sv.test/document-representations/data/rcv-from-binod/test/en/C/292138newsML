Airbus talking to Korean firms about share of A3XX . European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie said Tuesday it was in advanced negotiations with South Korean firms to help finance its planned A3XX large plane . Airbus wants to involve other companies in up to 40 percent of funding for the A3XX , which would supplement traditional financing through government launch aid and Airbus partners ' own resources . " We are in advanced discussions with South Korean firms , " an Airbus spokesman said , confirming the potential partners were Daewoo , Hyundai , Korean Air and Samsung , as reported in British specialist magazine Flight International . However , the spokesman said the official Airbus estimate for developing the A3XX was $ 8 billion , not $ 10 billion as reported . Flight quoted Airbus senior vice president Juergen Thomas as saying projections for the A3XX development cost had risen to $ 10 billion from $ 8 billion . Rival Boeing Co . has consistently contested Airbus ' cost estimate , saying it was far too low . Airbus is also in advanced discussions with a U . S . manufacturer on the A3XX , although it appeared that Northrop Grumman , which has been in talks with the consortium , was " dropping out , " an industry source said . Alenia , a unit of Italian holding company Finmeccanica , and Sweden ' s Saab , are also in talks with Airbus . Flight said other companies that have expressed interest include Belairbus and Canada ' s Bombardier . The A3XX family would consist of a basic 555 - seat plane , the A3XX - 100 , provisionally priced at $ 198 million each , the longer - range A3XX - 100R , at $ 201 . 5 million , and a stretched 656 - seat A3XX - 200 at $ 223 million . The 555 - seat aircraft would enter service in 2003 .

SEC censures Deloitte partner for stock holding . The Securities and Exchange Commission said it censured a partner at Deloitte & Touche for allegedly not promptly selling stock he bought in a company that became an auditing client of the firm . The order was issued against Michael Goodbread , who consented to the sanction without admitting or denying the SEC ' s findings . According to the SEC , Goodbread bought 400 shares of Koger Properties Inc in December 1988 . Goodbread was later assigned as audit partner in the firm ' s audit of Koger ' s financial statements for the year ended March 31 , 1990 . He did not sell the stock until May 10 , 1990 , an " unethical and improper professional conduct , " the SEC said . The SEC said Goodbread was also in violation of generally accepted accounting standards by owning stock of a client during the time of an audit engagement . The SEC said he also he failed to inform his company that he owned stock in Koger , bringing up the question of the accounting firm ' s independence .

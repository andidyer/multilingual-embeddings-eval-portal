Full text of October 30 UK monetary minutes . The following is the complete text of the minutes of the October 30 monthly monetary policy meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George . The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England met , together with officials , on 30 October , to review monetary developments . MONETARY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS2 . Latest monetary and economic data ( reviewed by officials before the meeting ) provided further evidence that cost and price pressures remained moderate . However , there were further signs that output growth had started to pick up , and recent indicators of business confidence and consumer demand remained strong . INFLATION INDICATORS3 . Underlying inflation ( RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - RPIX ) rose unexpectedly by 0 . 1 percentage point in September , to 2 . 9 percent , due largely to higher world oil prices and higher retail margins . All - items RPI inflation was unchanged at 2 . 1 percent . 4 . Most other price and cost indicators confirmed that inflationary pressures remained moderate : - - sterling non - oil commodity prices fell by 0 . 3 percent in September . However , the oil price had risen again to $ 23 . 3 per barrel - - sterling ' s effective exchange rate index had risen sharply ( by around 3 . 5 percent ) in the period since the last meeting , to stand at 89 . 1 - - total non - oil import prices fell by 1 . 4 percent in the three months to August compared to the previous three months , and were 1 . 3 percent lower than a year ago . Non - EC import prices fell by 1 . 7 percent in the three months to September on the previous three months - - producer input prices for manufacturing ( excluding food , beverage , tobacco and petroleum industries ) rose in September by just 0 . 1 percent ; and compared to a year ago they were 6 . 5 percent lower . The CIPS survey input price indicator rose in September , but remained low - - producer output prices ( excluding FBTP ) rose by 0 . 1 percent in September ; but the annual inflation rate fell to 0 . 9 percent , from 1 . 2 percent in August . The CBI survey output price expectations balance increased in October , but remained at a low level - - the annual growth rate of underlying average earnings was unchanged in August , at 4 . 0 percent ; and IRS median pay settlements were unchanged at 3 . 0 per cent in August . MONETARY AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS5 . Notes and coin grew by 0 . 4 percent in September , down from 0 . 7 percent in August ; and the annual growth rate fell to 7 . 4 percent , from 7 . 6 percent in August . M0 grew by 0 . 2 percent in September , down from 0 . 8 percent in August ; and the annual growth rate fell to 7 . 0 percent , from 7 . 5 percent in August . 6 . M4 grew by 0 . 8 percent in September , down from 0 . 9 percent in August ; but the annual growth rate rose to 9 . 8 percent , from 9 . 4 percent in August . Growth in M4 lending was 0 . 5 percent in September , down from 0 . 7 percent in August ; and the annual growth rate fell to 9 . 1 percent , from 9 . 3 percent in August . 7 . The Halifax house price index fell by 0 . 1 percent in September , but it was up 5 . 2 percent on a year earlier . The Nationwide index rose by 1 . 3 percent in September , leaving it 6 . 7 percent up on a year earlier . Housing market transactions continued to recover ; particulars delivered ( which lag actual transactions ) in the three months to September were 5 . 5 percent up on the previous three months , and 12 . 0 percent up on a year earlier . 8 . Short - term interest rates were around 15 basis points lower in the US since the last meeting , but had risen slightly in Germany and were little changed in Japan . UK short - term interest rates had risen by over 20 basis points since last month ; and forward rates implicit in short - sterling futures contracts had also risen ( by up to 14 basis points ) at all maturities . 9 . 10 - year bond yields had fallen by around 40 basis points in the US , and by around 15 basis points and 20 basis points in Germany and Japan respectively . In the UK , yields on conventional gilts had also fallen at all maturities ( by up to 20 basis points ) . Since the last meeting inflation expectations implied by the gilt yield curve ( calculated by the Bank from the difference between the yields on conventional and index - linked bonds ) had fallen by around 10 basis points for both 5 and 10 years ahead . ACTIVITY INDICATORS10 . In the US recent data indicated that output growth was slowing to a more sustainable rate . There was an unexpected fall in employment in September , following strong rises in each of the previous three months . Industrial production rose by 0 . 2 percent in September , following a rise of 0 . 3 percent in August . The latest estimate of US GDP growth in Q2 was 1 . 1 percent , leaving it 2 . 7 percent up on a year earlier . In Japan industrial production rose by 1 . 0 percent in September , following a fall of 2 . 3 percent in August . 11 . In Germany industrial production was flat in August , following a rise of 0 . 8 percent in July . In France GDP was estimated to have fallen by 0 . 4 percent in Q2 , following a rise of 1 . 1 percent in Q1 . 12 . The preliminary estimates of UK GDP growth in Q3 showed that both whole economy and non - oil GDP grew by 0 . 8 percent , and were 2 . 3 percent higher than a year earlier . Services output was estimated to have grown by 0 . 9 percent in Q3 , and was 3 . 3 percent higher than a year earlier . 13 . Most other activity data were consistent with a pick - up in growth , and more forward - looking indicators of business confidence and consumer demand remained strong : - - however , manufacturing output fell by 0 . 3 percent in August , and in the three months to August it was down 0 . 4 percent on a year earlier . Total industrial output fell by 0 . 4 percent in August , but in the latest three months was up 0 . 6 percent on a year earlier - - all major business surveys were more buoyant . The September CIPS survey and the CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey both showed an increase in output and new orders indicators . The BCC survey was also stronger - - retail sales fell by 0 . 3 percent in September , following a rise of 0 . 9 percent in August ; but in the three months to September sales were 3 . 4 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier - - survey indicators in the retail sector remained strong : consumer confidence remained at a high level by historical standards , and in the September CBI Distributive Trades Survey the balance of retailers expecting higher sales fell slightly , but remained at a high level - - claimant unemployment fell by 35 , 600 in September , and unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres rose by 17 , 100 . SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION14 . The Governor said that for some months now we had been observing what was in some respects a textbook domestically - driven upswing in the economy . It had been reflected initially in an acceleration in monetary growth last year ; it had come through into final domestic demand , especially consumer demand , in the first half of this year ; and gradually over the summer - as the restraining effect of the downward stock adjustment had diminished - it had started to come through into faster output and employment growth . Although this had not resulted in upward pressure on costs and prices in the short term , the Bank had looked through to a pick - up in inflation as the upswing progressed , and its view had been that the inflation target was at significant risk some two years or so ahead . 15 . The latest data - both official data on output and surveys of spending intentions - were consistent with this evolving prospect . But there were two new features . First , retail price inflation ( RPIX ) had not fallen over the past three months as had been expected . Second , there had been a sharp appreciation of the exchange rate . In each case the question to be considered was whether these developments were just one - off , short - term , effects or whether they were likely to have a more lasting influence on the rate of inflation . 16 . Before coming back to those developments , the Governor first reviewed the underlying situation . There had not been much change in the monetary data . Narrow money growth ( notes and coin ) , which had looked as if it might be beginning to moderate earlier in the year , had in fact continued at an underlying rate of some 7 percent . And broad money ( M4 ) and credit ( M4 lending ) growth had also continued at around the 9 percent rate seen for the past year . These rates of growth , and their sectoral composition , were consistent with continuing strong nominal demand from both the household and business sectors . They were unlikely to be consistent with 2 . 5 percent RPIX inflation into the medium - term . 17 . The revisions to Q2 GDP data - including upward revisions to both private consumption and investment , reflected in final domestic demand growth at an above - trend annual rate of 4 percent in H1 - had become available just before the last meeting . But the subsequent monthly data suggested that final domestic demand had continued to grow strongly in Q3 . Retail sales volumes had slipped back only slightly in September ( - 0 . 3 percent ) after the strong rise in August ( + 0 . 9 percent ) , leaving the trend over the past year at about 3 . 5 percent ; and the CBI survey suggested this trend was expected to continue . The housing market continued to improve ; both house prices and activity were still rising - notwithstanding some erratic figures for September . Business optimism - in both the CBI and BCC quarterly surveys and the CIPS monthly survey had clearly improved , as had the proportion of firms planning new investment . There was , moreover , some suggestion in the monthly trade data that net external demand was holding up rather better than might have been expected . 18 . Output growth ( both including and excluding North Sea oil ) in Q3 had accelerated to 0 . 8 percent ( from 0 . 6 percent and 0 . 5 percent in Q1 and Q2 respectively ) . This might suggest that reduced stockbuilding was now acting as less of a constraint on manufacturing production , although the latest production figures themselves ( for August ) remained disappointingly weak surprisingly so given the survey evidence of stronger activity . The service sector continued to perform strongly . 19 . The Governor noted that the faster growth of output over the summer had been accompanied by an improvement in the labour market . On the latest data , claimant unemployment had fallen faster than earlier in the year and there had also been a sizeable fall ( 50 , 000 ) on the ILO definition . Employment had risen strongly on both the Workforce in Employment and LFS measures . Total hours worked , measured by the LFS - the most comprehensive measure of labour demand - had risen by 0 . 8 percent , having been flat over the preceding year . 20 . Up to this point the upswing had not been accompanied by significant inflationary cost or price pressures . We had benefited over much of the past year from weak commodity prices ; and even though oil prices had recently strengthened , producer input prices in September were still 2 . 7 percent below a year ago . Excluding FBTP input prices were 6 . 5 percent lower , though they had picked up marginally in each of the past two months . Producer output prices similarly had been subdued , rising by only 2 . 2 percent in total over the year to September , or by only 0 . 9 percent excluding FBTP . 21 . Given developments in the labour market , average earnings growth ( rising from 3 . 75 percent to 4 percent on the latest figures , for July and August ) and pay settlements generally ( at around 3 . 5 percent on Bank figures ) had been relatively modest . However , there had been a number of larger pay claims as well as reviving talk of skill shortages in some sectors . 22 . The Governor said that against this background , the Bank had expected that retail price inflation would tend to moderate and that RPIX in particular would fall from the near - 3 percent rate at which it had been stuck for the past year to 2 . 5 percent or less by around the end of this year . This now looked very unlikely - in the absence of offsetting factors RPIX might rise above 3 percent on the October data as a sharp fall last year dropped out of the calculation . Part of the reason why RPIX inflation had not recently declined as expected was the effect of higher oil prices . This effect might be expected to be one - off , affecting the price level but not the continuing rate of change of prices : it could even reverse itself if the oil price itself declined . To this extent the recent failure of RPIX to decline should not necessarily influence the view of the rate of inflation further ahead . But the other unexpected influences were not necessarily as benign . Services prices , for example , might well be increasing faster than had been supposed because some of the services industries were coming up against capacity constraints ; and price increases for clothing and footwear , too , might reflect relatively buoyant demand . There was also some evidence to suggest that some retailers were seeking to restore their margins . The prudent assumption was that , in some part at least , recent stronger - than - expected RPIX inflation would persist , increasing the threat to the inflation target . That in turn strengthened the case for tightening monetary policy . 23 . On the other hand the exchange rate had strengthened ( by 3 . 5 percent on the ERI since the last meeting , and by nearly 6 percent since the Bank ' s Inflation Report in August ) . The direct effect of this , too , assuming it was sustained , could be a one - off , short - term , downward effect on the price level ; or it could have a more enduring effect on the rate of inflation , depending on its cause and on the policy reaction . To the extent that it reflected a relative easing of monetary policy abroad ( and interest rates had fallen in continental Europe over the Summer ) there might be no continuing effect on UK inflation ; and , to the extent that it anticipated a tightening of policy in the UK , it would have a longer - term impact on inflation only if policy were in fact tightened . The truth was that we did not know with any great confidence why the exchange rate had appreciated . Although the exchange rate rise would be expected to provide an offset to the underlying upwards pressure on inflation in the short term ( say over the next 6 - 12 months ) , it was likely to be a waning factor further ahead . 24 . The Governor said that the policy conclusion that the Bank drew from all this was quite clear . The Bank thought it made the need for tightening more urgent . Output was already , on the Q3 GDP figure , growing above trend in response to the upswing in demand , and this was likely to continue if not accelerate . And although it might well be that some degree of spare capacity remained in the economy as a whole , the failure of RPIX to fall as had been expected might suggest that capacity constraints were being approached - or approached too rapidly - in some sectors . And the most recent developments in the labour market might be very early signs that some sectors of that market were approaching a speed limit too - though the Bank was not confident about that . 25 . It was being argued by some that the stronger exchange rate in itself represented a tightening of policy . But , while it should tend to offset some of the emerging domestically - generated inflationary pressures in the short run , it did nothing directly to address the source of those pressures - the accelerating upswing in domestic demand and now output - further ahead . To that extent it did not necessarily in itself do much to improve the chances of hitting the inflation target . 26 . The Bank therefore recommended that interest rates should rise immediately by 1 / 4 percent . That might well not be enough to moderate the upswing sufficiently to restore a better - than - evens chance of achieving the inflation target over the next two years . But , in a context where inflation was now less likely to be below 2 . 5 percent for any length of time in the short run , and given present expectations about the constraints on policy , a 1 / 4 percent move now could have a relatively strong signal effect on the credibility of policy . That would reduce the size and speed of the rise in rates that might eventually be necessary to make the inflation target secure and sustain the economic expansion . 27 . The Chancellor said that he and the Governor were agreed on the starting point from which to consider a change in interest rates . Growth in the economy had been much as they had expected earlier in the year . The overall economic outlook was encouraging . The recovery was gathering momentum and was becoming more balanced . Stronger growth was not only coming from consumer demand ; surveys of manufacturing output and export growth were also picking up . 28 . The Chancellor said that , although there were still no immediate inflationary pressures , he wanted to ensure that the inflation target was met in 18 months to 2 years time . Their task at these meetings was to judge how best to do that . The small difference between them the previous month had been one of timing . They had known then that by this meeting they would have the flash estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter , which they had agreed was an important piece of evidence . The Chancellor had wanted to wait until that information was available . 29 . In contrast to the flash estimates of growth in the first and second quarters , which were at variance with other indicators and which had eventually been revised up , the Chancellor was inclined to believe the 0 . 8 percent flash estimate of growth in the third quarter . This showed that GDP was up 2 . 4 percent on a year ago , and in the third quarter had grown at an annual rate of 3 . 2 percent . While this clearly represented an acceleration in activity , it was not startling . As he had said before , he thought the economy could sustain growth above trend for some years without inflationary pressures re - emerging . But the fact that GDP had accelerated and was likely to continue accelerating was very relevant to the decision on interest rates . 30 . The Chancellor said that the recovery was still not completely uniform , for example manufacturing had fallen back slightly in the latest month . Retail sales had also fallen back slightly in September , but were up 3 . 5 percent compared to a year ago . Most of the indicators of consumer demand were indicating healthy growth in the consumer sector . In the next few months some of the windfalls from building societies converting to plc status would start coming through which would give a further boost . The Chancellor expected retailers to have a good Christmas , but he did not think there was any sign of an excessive consumer boom . 31 . Activity was picking up in the housing market , but sales of houses in London were distorting the overall picture which remained patchy . Demand was high and supply was restricted as homeowners were still keeping their houses off the market in expectation of further price increases . He certainly did not want the recovery in the housing market to get out of hand and would watch it closely . 32 . The message from the monetary data had not changed much . M0 was growing at 7 percent a year , and M4 was growing at 9 . 8 percent , consistent with buoyant consumer demand . 33 . The Chancellor noted that there had been a big fall in unemployment that month , although it was not clear that this indicated a pick - up in the trend rate of decline . There were , as yet , few reports of skill shortages and earnings growth remained subdued . 34 . The Chancellor said that the underlying price data remained very good . Commodity prices were generally subdued , and only the sharp rise in oil prices was having any adverse effect on inflation . Producer price inflation also remained very low . He had been disappointed that in recent months headline RPI inflation had not fallen below 2 percent . Underlying inflation had also increased . It would also probably rise further next month , largely for technical reasons reflecting what had happened last year . The Chancellor said however , he was setting monetary policy on the basis of the prospects for inflation , not on what was happening to inflation now . 35 . Although he did not have an exchange rate target , the exchange rate was relevant to their discussion . Nobody really knew why sterling had appreciated recently , just as they had not known why sterling had depreciated 18 months ago . The recent appreciation of sterling did tighten policy , although the impact on inflation would depend on why sterling had appreciated and how long it would last . 36 . The Chancellor said that the risk that the economy would continue to grow below trend seemed to be behind us . We were experiencing a good , strong recovery which was set to strengthen . He had anticipated events before , when he had raised interest rates back in 1994 . He wanted to stay ahead of the game again this time , and he was inclined to agree with the Governor ' s recommendation to move interest rates up by a 1 / 4 percent . He saw no case for a larger rise . 37 . In discussion the following points were made : - - the economy as a whole was now growing at or above trend . The first estimate for GDP in Q3 showed that output growth had picked up as expected , following the recovery in domestic demand in the first half of the year . The official data for manufacturing output were weaker than the more forward - looking survey evidence - - recent outturns for retail inflation had been somewhat disappointing . This largely reflected higher oil prices and the exceptionally good data in October 1995 . However , there were also some indications that retailers were increasing their margins ; and to the extent that inflation was responding to demand pressures , this was a potential cause for concern - - there were a number of possible reasons for the appreciation in the exchange rate in recent months . If it reflected a perception of looser monetary policy abroad , some appreciation would be appropriate to offset higher import prices in the future . But whatever the cause , the appreciation would put some downward pressure on domestic inflation in the short term , unless it was reversed quickly - - interest rates had been reduced earlier in the year , in part to reduce the downside risks to activity at the time . Those risks had now disappeared , and it was appropriate to raise rates again , as growth accelerated . Raising interest rates now would also improve the balance of risks with regard to achieving the inflation target - - an early rise in rates could well have a significant effect on expectations , which would increase its impact . CONCLUSION38 . Summing up the Chancellor said that he thought a 1 / 4 percent increase in interest rates this month was justified . Although cost pressures remained weak , the pick - up in activity was well - established and the pace of growth had accelerated in the third quarter . He saw no reason for delay , and raising rates early should emphasise his determination to achieve the inflation target . 39 . The Bank announced a 1 / 4 percent increase in interest rates at noon that day .

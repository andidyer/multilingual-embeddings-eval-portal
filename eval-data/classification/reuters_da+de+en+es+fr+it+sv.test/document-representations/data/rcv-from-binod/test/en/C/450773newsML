Shell , Texaco to merge some U . S . operations . Shell Oil Co . and Texaco Inc . announced plans Tuesday to merge some of their domestic refining and marketing operations in a deal that is expected to spark a round of consolidation among the nation ' s major refiners . The companies said they signed an agreement to combine their refining and marketing businesses in the Midwest and West and their transportation , trading and lubricants operations nationwide . It was the latest move by big oil companies to combine refining operations that have been plagued by high costs and weak profits . Talks were also continuing on the last part of a long - awaited deal to merge the eastern refining operations of Shell and Texaco with those of Saudi Refining Inc . , operating as Star Enterprises , which is jointly owned by Texaco and state - owned oil company Saudi Aramco . " We will create a new entity with economic potential far greater than the sum of its parts , " said Texaco Chairman Peter Bijur , who expects the merged company to be able to boost profits for its corporate parents , hold down costs and ultimately create additional jobs . Consumers will continue to purchase gasoline from the familiar Texaco and Shell stations operated by independent wholesalers and retailers , the companies said . The deal drew sharp protests from consumer advocates who said the merger would reduce competition , particularly in California where three companies - - Atlantic Richfield Co . , Chevron Corp . and Texaco / Shell - - would control 75 percent of the gasoline retail market . " If allowed by the Federal Trade Commission , a merger between Shell and Texaco would set a dangerous precedent in the oil market , " Citizen Action energy policy director Edwin Rothschild said . In the regions covered under the agreement , there are 6 , 735 Texaco stations and 4 , 448 Shell stations that together sell 14 percent of gasoline sold at service stations , Texaco said . There may be some job cuts as the merger is accomplished , the companies said , but it was expected that new jobs will be created from long - term growth opportunities generated by the new venture . Shell , a U . S . unit of Royal Dutch / Shell Group , will own 56 percent of the new company and White Plains , N . Y . - based Texaco will control 44 percent , they said . The as - yet - unnamed company would operate the service stations in 28 Midwest and western states and own eight refineries with the capacity to process 948 , 000 barrels of crude oil a day , about 6 percent of U . S . refining capacity . Philip Carroll , president of Houston - based Shell , said the deal would increase pressure on rivals to combine domestic operations to compete in an industry that had record profits last year but is under constant pressure to keep prices down . " There is a powerful case for fundamental change in the way petroleum refining and marketing companies operate in the United States , " he said in a statement . " For several years , the industry has faced difficult business conditions requiring increased efficiencies . " Shell and Texaco said their exploration , production and chemical businesses were not included in the new company . Shell and Texaco executives declined to comment on possible regulatory hurdles , but in their statement they noted market share is much more concentrated in other industries . The two largest beer makers , for example , control nearly 70 percent of U . S . sales , while the Texaco - Shell venture will open for business with about 15 percent of the domestic gasoline market . Shell , Texaco and Star Enterprises said they had made " significant progress " in ongoing talks and expected to complete an agreement in the second quarter of this year .

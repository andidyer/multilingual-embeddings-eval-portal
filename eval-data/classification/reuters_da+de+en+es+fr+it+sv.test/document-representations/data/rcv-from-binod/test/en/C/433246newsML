Keppel profit down , propose bonus . Shipping conglomerate Keppel Corporation Ltd reported a drop in earnings on Tuesday and surprised analysts by proposing a bonus issue . The group reported a 4 . 7 percent drop in net profit to Singapore $ 204 . 10 million for the year ended December 31 , 1996 . The earnings were in line with market expectations , but analysts said they were surprised when Keppel proposed a one - for - four bonus share issue , its first since 1982 , to " reward shareholders " . " It is strange to have a bonus issue when profits are down . I think the move is primarily to prop up the share price , " said an analyst with a foreign broking house . Keppel shares ended down S $ 0 . 20 at S $ 10 . 10 on active turnover of 1 . 9 million shares after hitting a new year low of S $ 10 . 00 on Tuesday . " Before the bonus issue announcement , we were looking for Keppel to test S $ 9 . 50 . But now , I think there will be a concerted effort to keep the share price around S $ 10 . 00 , " said the analyst . " But if it breaks S $ 10 . 00 , it could go down to test S $ 9 . 00 . " An analyst with a local broking firm said she expected Keppel to fall eventually to S $ 9 . 50 despite the bonus . The analysts said likely earnings from the property and finance sectors were expected to prop up marine conglomerate Keppel Corp Ltd ' s 1997 earnings . Keppel said it expected to maintain its 1997 results at 1996 levels despite difficult market conditions . Analysts said Keppel ' s off - shore rigbuilding and repair unit , Keppel FELS , was likely to weigh down the group ' s performance this year . FELS said on Monday it expected " substantially lower " results for the current year as it has no major contracts to complete in 1997 . " We are looking for a modest growth for Keppel . It will get its boost from its banking and property arms , but profits will be dragged lower by FELS , " an analyst with a U . S . securities firm said , referring to Keppel Bank and ( Keppel Land ) . - Angela Tan , Singapore Newsroom ( 65 - 8703083 )

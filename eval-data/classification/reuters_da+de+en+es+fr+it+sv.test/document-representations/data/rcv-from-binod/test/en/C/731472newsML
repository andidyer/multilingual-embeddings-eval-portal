Intel surges to new high after Q2 result . Shares of Intel Corp , the world ' s largest semiconductor company , soared to new trading highs Wednesday as analysts said second quarter results showed the company is powering through a major product shift . The stock jumped to 86 - 15 / 16 in early trading and was up 4 - 31 / 32 at 85 - 7 / 8 at 1045 EDT , above its previous intraday high of 84 - 7 / 8 . Several analysts renewed their " buy " ratings on Intel , saying the company is poised to show a substantial leap in results in the final quarter of 1997 . They said the fourth quarter would set the stage for further strong earnings growth in coming years . As expected , a number of analysts pared their third quarter and full - year earnings estimates for Intel , based on expectations for essentially flat earnings per share and flat to only slightly higher revenues in the third quarter . But analysts say this had mostly been discounted by the market , and investors are focusing on the prospect that Intel will sustain earnings levels while making it through what its chief executive officer Andrew Grove calls a " monumental " product transition . PaineWebber analyst John Lazlo said in a market note that he was reiterating his buy recommendation on Intel , projecting 20 to 25 percent earnings growth during the next several years . " Although the disappointing news about the prospects for flat sequential ( earnings per share ) in the third quarter dims the near - term outlook , the more rapid transition to new product caused by the rapid shift in end - user preferences may actually strengthen Intel ' s competitive position as it will transition more rapidly to the sixth - generation product , " Laslo said in the note . Grove reported strong demand for the Pentium with MMX multimedia technology and the Pentium II microprocessors and said the company is shifting production toward the new computer chips at a record pace . Apparently , Intel is succeeding in generating enthusiasm for its MMX technology . Lazlo said he had cut his 1997 earnings per share estimate for Intel to $ 4 . 08 from $ 4 . 23 and had lowered his 1997 revenue estimate to $ 25 . 7 billion from $ 26 . 6 billion . He said third quarter earnings per share will likely be flat with the second quarter ' s $ 0 . 92 . But he said Intel ' s commanding market share with top - tier personal computer makers , its manufacturing capabilities and financial muscle , and its ability to rapidly introduce new products will help it limit the success of rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix Corp . More importantly , analysts said , Intel should be hitting full - stride in the manufacture of new - generation processors in the fourth quarter , traditionally the strongest period of the year for the PC industry . Although some analysts are still expressing concern over the depth of price cuts Intel is due to announce at the end of the month , others said this will stoke PC demand further . " I ' m pretty confident that Intel ' s fourth quarter will definitely clear up , because basically the product transition issues will be over , " said Robert Chaplinsky , analyst at Hambrecht & Quist , a San Francisco investment bank .

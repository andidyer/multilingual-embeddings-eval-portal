India internet users seen at 1 . 5 million by 2000 . Indian internet subscribers will grow to 1 . 5 million in three years from the present 80 , 000 as a result of the government ' s decision to open up internet access , an official of India ' s Apex Infotech association said on Monday . " The number of internet users will increase many fold to 1 . 5 million by 2000 , with free competition in access provision , " Dewang Mehta , executive director , National Association of Software and Service Companies ( NASSCOM ) , told Reuters . He said that with competition , the costs will fall dramatically , and the Internet will spread rapidly in India . " It will no longer remain the preserve of the elite , " he said . India ' s government took a decision to open up the market to internet access providers last week , and waived the licence fee for two years , as well as imposed no restrictions on the number of access providers . The only condition that access providers have to adhere to is to use the international gateways of state - run international communications provider , Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( VSNL ) to connect to the Internet . Mehta said that Internet access rates in India were set to tumble . With free competition , the average monthly rate would be about Rs 500 ( $ 14 ) for unrestricted access , he stated . At present , internet access is the monopoly of the government , and the cost of a commercial connection is $ 0 . 87 per hour . The only commercial provider is VSNL which has about 40 , 000 subscribers after two years of running the service . The government ' s Department of Electronics runs a service for educational institutions and non profit organisations called Education and Research Network ( ERNET ) , which has 40 , 000 subscribers . Mehta said that the average investment in infrastructure for an internet access provider to connect a 100 users would be in the region of 1 . 0 million rupees . He said that if the government had not opened up this sector , the country would have lost out on the internet boom , which in the long term would have affected India ' s software development edge .

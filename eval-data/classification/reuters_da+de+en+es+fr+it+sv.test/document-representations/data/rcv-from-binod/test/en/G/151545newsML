UN says 600 , 000 refugees in Zaire cut off from aid . The U . N . refugee agency expressed concern on Tuesday about 600 , 000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutus cut off from foreign aid in eastern Zaire and reported fighting near huge camps on Rwanda ' s borders which could set off a new exodus . UNHCR spokeswoman Ruth Marshall also urged regional governments to seek a political solution to a spreading conflict that pits Zairean troops against ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge fighters who now control parts of eastern Zaire . " The situation in eastern Zaire is now desperate , " she said . " We have absolutely no knowledge of the location or situation of more than half a million people who fled fighting . . . We don ' t have any precise idea at all where they are or how they are , " " With a crisis of this sort of dimension , there is no humanitarian solution possible . The solution is clearly political , " Marshall told a news briefing in Geneva . Her statement underlined warnings from aid workers that ethnic war has pushed Zaire into an Africa - wide calamity demanding world action . The European Union ' s humanitarian aid Commissioner Emma Bonino said in Brussels a million people could die in Zaire " in a return of barbarism " unless something is done to save them . European politicians and diplomats say the chaotic , mineral - rich Central African nation , whose leader Mobutu Sese Seko is in a Swiss clinic after cancer treatment , could be approaching a political " meltdown " . In eastern Zaire ' s Uvira and Bukavu regions , some 300 , 000 refugees are on the run in hills , bushes and tea plantations , fleeing the ethnic conflict which is spreading further north to Goma region home to another 700 , 000 Rwandan Hutus . As part of diplomatic efforts to try to solve the crisis , U . N . secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali will appoint a new special envoy to be based in the region , his spokeswoman at the U . N . ' s European headquarters in Geneva , Therese Gastaut , said . Many among the Rwandan refugees killed or watched others kill during 1994 ' s Hutu - led genocide of half a million minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates and refuse to return home where a Tutsi - dominated government is in power . Hutu militia among the refugees have kept the military threat alive with forays into Rwanda from camps where they were fed and watered by U . N . agencies . Repeated Rwandan government calls to move the camps away from the borders fell on deaf ears . At the weekend in Goma , 190 , 000 Hutus fled the vast Kibumba camp on the foothills of Rwanda ' s mountainous borders after an attack by suspected Tutsi rebels and took shelter in Mugunga camp on volcanic rock near Goma town . Marshall said UNHCR had reports of fighting in Katale and Kahindo camps further north of Goma , home to 315 , 000 refugees . In Goma , now cut off from all aid routes , she said U . N . agencies had less than a week of food supplies left . " We ' re basically distributing all the food we have , which is good for something less than one week . We need to get the food to these people in case the mayhem in eastern Zaire spreads to their area , " she said . The U . N . refugee agency has urged Hutus to go home to escape the conflict , but Marshall said only about 1 , 000 have done so . Ironically , the Banyamulenge rebellion has broken the stalemate over Africa ' s worst refugee crisis and got the Hutu refugees , who cost the world $ 1 million a day in aid , moving from camps where birth rates were among the world ' s highest . Some diplomats say Western donors will see the crisis as the beginning of an end game and refuse to pay for the creation of new camps in the hope refugees can be coaxed back into Rwanda . But aid officials say the Hutus are likely to try to head deeper into Zaire if pushed . " Our worst case scenario is that we don ' t have access to hundreds of thousands of people who need that access , who are in great danger potentially , " said Marshall . " We have no idea what ' s happening . "

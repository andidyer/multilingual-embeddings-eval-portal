Megawati ' s lawyers say Indonesian courts unfair . Eighty lawyers backing ousted Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) leader Megawati Sukarnoputri have demanded the judiciary answer allegations that judges have been swayed by government pressure on cases involving her . One of the lawyers , Firman Akbar , said on Wednesday a group of lawyers visited the Supreme Court on Tuesday to submit a petition demanding an explanation about reports that courts had succumbed to government pressure in cases involving Megawati . " The courts ' verdicts on the suits filed by Megawati seem to have a similar pattern . . . that they say they do not have the authority to hear the case , " Akbar told Reuters by telephone . He said no deadline had been set for a response . A Supreme Court spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday but confirmed the complaint had been received . Megawati , daughter of Indonesia ' s late founding president Sukarno , has sued the government and the military over her government - supported dismissal last June from the leadership of the Christian - Nationalist PDI . The Central Jakarta State Court , which heard the case against the armed forces chief , Interior Minister , and Megawati ' s political rivals , dismissed the suit last year , saying it did not have the authority to rule on an internal party matter . The case is now before the High Court , one step below the Supreme Court , after Megawati appealed the verdict . Her lawyers say Megawati ' s supporters have also filed about 130 suits against her removal in courts across Indonesia and many cases had been rejected on the same grounds . Akbar said the lawyers had received information that unnamed government officials had two meetings with judges and Supreme Court officials in Jakarta and Yogyakarta in central Java last year . He said the lawyers alleged that at one of the meetings , government officials requested courts prepare ways of dismissing all Megawati lawsuits on technical grounds . Akbar gave no further details . The minority PDI , the Moslem - based United Development Party ( PDI ) and the ruling Golkar are the only political parties legally permitted to contest general elections on May 29 .

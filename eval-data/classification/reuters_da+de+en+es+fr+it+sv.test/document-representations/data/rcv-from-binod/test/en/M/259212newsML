The benchmark index of the country ' s premier bourse , the Bombay Stock Exchange , surged 77 . 50 points , or 2 . 7 percent , to close at 2 , 958 . 65 .

" This bit of good news is a tonic for the markets , " Antony Sequeira , managing director at Arcadia Share & Stock Brokers , told Reuters . Finance Minister P . Chidambaram on Sunday said that a controversial minimum corporate tax may be phased out after a new Income Tax Act and Companies Act came into force . " The introduction of MAT ( Minimum Alternate Tax ) in the last budget has caused a high degree of discomfort to industry . It was introduced as a number of companies were paying dividend but not tax , " Chidambaram told a recent seminar organised by the International Association of Lawyers , newspapers reported on Monday . The new tax , introduced in July by Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda ' s coalition government , was aimed at high - growth firms that avoided paying taxes by ploughing back profits into new projects or expansions . " MAT will definitely not go away , but there might be a simplification , " said Ulhas Paymaster , a BSE broker . " While in the past the government had overlooked the consequences of imposing MAT , it now seems that it would seriously review the same , " brokerage firm Khandwala Securities said in its weekly report . Last week , Deve Gowda told industrialists in New Delhi he would review the recently introduced tax in next year ' s budget , which the industrialists told him was the cause of slowing industrial growth and corporate profits . The benchark BSE index jumped about five percent the next day . India ' s budget for fiscal 1997 / 98 ( April - March ) is normally presented to parliament in the last week of February . " Sentiments have taken a U - turn , " said senior trader Ramnik Parekh , referring to Chidambaram ' s comments about MAT .

Most dealers said local funds led by the Unit Trust of India , the country ' s biggest mutual fund , were major buyers in index - linked stocks on Monday . Foreign funds , however , remained on the sidelines , they said .

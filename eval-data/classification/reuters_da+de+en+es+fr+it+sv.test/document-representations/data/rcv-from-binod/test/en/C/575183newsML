Lucent in $ 350 mln AT & T cable unit pact . Lucent Technologies Inc said Monday it had agreed to a series of new pacts valued at $ 350 million with AT & T Submarine Systems Inc , the undersea cable subsidiary of AT & T Corp . In April , Tyco International Ltd agreed to buy AT & T ' s submarine systems business in a $ 850 million deal . Lucent ' s pacts with Submarine Systems Inc , which range from one to three years , include a volume purchasing commitment naming Lucent as a preferred supplier of fiber optics , digital transmission equipment , network management hardware and software , and microelectronics components . Under the terms of the deals , Lucent will supply communications equipment for SSI ' s recently awarded Atlantic Crossing ( AC - 1 ) , a first - of - its - kind cable system to directly connect the United States , Germany and the United Kingdom . The system is slated to be placed into full service in 1998 and will span more than 14 , 000 kilometers under the Atlantic . As the former equipment arm of AT & T , Lucent was a major supplier to several of SSI ' s undersea cable systems including TPC - 5 - - the transpacific undersea fiber optic network that connects the United States and Asia . Among the other agreements between Lucent and SSI , the two companies will explore product development opportunities that address future needs of the undersea cable business . The parties will also conduct cooperative research aimed at creating systems to advance the speed and capacity of long - distance telecommunications networks . Lucent also will extend the lease of its work facilities now shared with SSI . With the exception of the research agreement , which went into effect in March , the announced contracts become effective upon the closing of sale between AT & T ' s submarine systems business and Tyco International . All agreements have the potential for subsequent renewals . " These agreements represent a significant amount of new business for Lucent Technologies and show that we are a valued supplier to the undersea communications market , " said Joseph Colson , president at Lucent ' s Network Systems unit . As part of the research pact , SSI and Lucent ' s research and development arm , Bell Laboratories , will conduct lightwave research for future undersea and land - based networks . Lightwave technology involves the use of photonics - - fiber - optic systems that use pulses of light to transmit voice , data and video over hair - thin glass fibers . - - E .

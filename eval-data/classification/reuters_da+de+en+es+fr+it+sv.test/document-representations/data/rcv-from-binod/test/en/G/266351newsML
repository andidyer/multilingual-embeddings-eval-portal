SOCCER - BONGARTZ TO BE NEW MOENCHENGLADBACH COACH . Struggling German first division side Borussia Mochengladbach on Thursday appointed Hannes Bongartz as their new coach . He replaces Bernd Krauss , sacked earlier this month as the club slid into the relegation zone . Bongartz , who was dismissed by Duisburg last May , made clear it would be some time before the glory days returned at Moenchengladbach , winners of five championships and two UEFA Cups in the 1970s . " Talking about making a UEFA Cup place this season is like tipping St Pauli to win the title , " he said . Moechengladbach , captained by gifted playmaker Stefan Effenberg , finished sixth last season . But this season they have scored just 12 goals in 17 games and went into the Bundesliga ' s winter break second from bottom of the table . Bongartz has also coached Kaiserslautern , FC Zurich and Wattenscheid , where he has worked as technical director for several months .

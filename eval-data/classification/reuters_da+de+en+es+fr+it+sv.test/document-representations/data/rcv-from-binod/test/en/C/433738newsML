Assets of Italian sports car manufacturer Bugatti will be sold off auction next month after lengthy attempts to salvage the legendary firm failed , receivers said on Tuesday .

Receiver Gian Luigi Rossini said the firm ' s assets , including a number of finished sports cars which never made it to the salesrooms , would be sold off in individual lots on April 4 in the northern Italian city of Modena . " We tried everything possible to give life back to Bugatti , but we cannot wait any longer . We have to pay the creditors , " Rossini said . The only thing not on offer will be the actual Bugatti marque , which is owned by Luxembourg - based Bugatti International - - itself under court administration . Receivers said in a statement they expected the Bugatti factory to fetch at least 5 . 3 billion lire ( $ 3 . 1 million ) . No price tag was put on the sports cars . The company was founded by Ettore Bugatti in 1909 . Production stopped in the 1950s but started again in 1989 when Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli bought the dormant marque , reviving it as a 350 kph ( 250 mph ) supercar , manufacturing the exotic vehicles at some $ 300 , 000 each . The firm failed to find enough buyers and collapsed under the weight of debt in 1995 .

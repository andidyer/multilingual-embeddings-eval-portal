POLAND ' S EMBATTLED FARM MINISTER IN HOSPITAL . Polish Farm Minister Roman Jagielinski , pressured by the leadership of his Peasant Party ( PSL ) to quit , has been taken to a hospital intensive care unit with a cardiac disorder , PAP news agency said on Monday . PAP quoted the ministry ' s spokesman Tomasz Krankowski as saying that Jagielinski , 50 , was taken to the Medical Academy hospital in the central city of Lodz on Sunday evening . Jagielinski , leader of the liberal wing in the co - ruling PSL , said on Saturday he would step down to avoid an open rift in his party . PSL leaders have accused him of pursuing wrong farm policies which brought a $ 1 billion food trade deficit in 1996 . The struggle within the PSL pits Jagielinski ' s faction against a bigger group led by Peasant chief Waldemar Pawlak , which represents the interests of small farmers wary of reforms and strongly lobbying for government subsidies . Pawlak has proposed that Jaroslaw Kalinowski , a hitherto little known 35 - year - old PSL politician , replace Jagielinski . The new minister will face the crucial task of shaping the Polish government team ' s mandate for negotiations on agriculture aspects of Poland ' s European Union membership bid . Analysts say Poland ' s underdeveloped aricultural sector will be one of the major issues in the accession talks expected to start next year . Jagielinski cannot be dismissed so long as he is on medical leave . - - Warsaw Newsroom + 48 22 653 9700

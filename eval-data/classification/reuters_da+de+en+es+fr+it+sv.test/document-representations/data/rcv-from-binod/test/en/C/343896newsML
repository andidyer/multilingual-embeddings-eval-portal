Malaysia ' s Effendi plans media empire . Malaysian businessman and politician Effendi Norwawi says he plans to build Malaysia ' s newest media and property empire by carving a niche at the top end of the market . Effendi is already in a number of businesses - - property , education , timber construction materials and media - - and in each he is targeting the growing number of newly wealthy consumers created by the booming Malaysian economy . " We are staying at the top end of the market . And that is where we will be , " the entrepreneur from Malaysia ' s eastern Sarawak state said in an interview on Wednesday . " I think I like to be there because it challenges us to be excellent , " said the 48 - year - old Effendi . " Cahaya homes are the most expensive in the country , we sell Cadillacs and in education we are at the top end of engineering and design schools , " he said . Cahaya is a 500 - acre property development just outside Kuala Lumpur . Its 317 homes , designed by 10 of the world ' s top architects , are expected to sell for a minimum $ 1 . 5 million each . Effendi ' s privately owned Encorp Group is investing 850 million ringgit ( $ 341 million ) in developing Cahaya . Last year , Encorp tied up with Parsons ' School of Design of New York to set up the Centre for Advanced Design ( Cenfad ) . It also has agreed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to jointly set up an engineering college . While property will remain the group ' s flagship sector , a large part of the group ' s growth will come from its media interests , he said . " We are a new player in media . But , it is definitely the growth industry , " Effendi said . Starting with a $ 12 million recording studio , Synchrosound , set up two years ago , the group is now venturing into radio and television . It also owns a major stake in the weekly newspaper " Edge " . " With the studio it is a natural thing for us to go into TV and radio . Now we are aiming to get into multimedia as well , " Effendi said . His group is investing $ 100 million to set up Malaysia ' s third national terrestrial channel , National Television , or NTV , to be launched later this year from Sarawak . " The TV , recording studio , radio , the print and other things . . . will have to converge somewhere . " They will all be information - technology based . This gives us a natural opportunity to be involved in the MSC ( multimedia supercorridor ) , " Effendi said . The multimedia supercorridor is a high technology zone 15 km by 50 km ( nine miles by 30 miles ) just outside Kuala Lumpur , to which Malaysia hopes to attract investments by large multinationals . Effendi also runs Quality Concrete Holdings Bhd Since listing on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on November 14 , the shares have surged to above 15 ringgit from a two - ringgit issue price . His associates say Effendi ' s beginnings were humble , coming as he did from Sarawak ' s Melanau tribe . But after attending the Malay College , whose graduates read like a who ' s who of Malaysian politics and business , Effendi joined the civil service . In 1976 , he left government service to enter business and in 1991 became a member of the Sarawak legislative assembly . He does not believe there are contradictions in being a businessman and a politician . " It gives me a balance in life . One day you are making deals for millions of dollars . The next day you are in your constituency looking at doing a drain which is ( worth ) 5 , 000 ringgit , " Effendi says . ( $ 1 = 2 . 49 ringgit )

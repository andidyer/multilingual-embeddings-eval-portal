Red Cross says 106 hostages held in Peru . The International Red Cross said on Tuesday that 106 hostages were being held by Marxist guerrillas at the Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima , instead of the 140 originally thought . " There are 106 hostages on the official list , " Red Cross official Jean - Pierre Sharer told reporters , revising the earlier Red Cross estimate . " There was a little confusion at first about how many hostages there were with the release ( on Sunday night ) of 225 persons , " Sharer added as he supervized efforts to re - supply water to the residence . The Red Cross official said the new figure for hostages being held was made after members of the organization had talked to everyone still inside the residence . About 20 heavily - armed Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels stormed a cocktail party at the ambassador ' s house on Dec 17 , taking hundreds of VIPs hostage . The rebels released all women and many of the young and elderly on the first night of the siege . Subsequently , they released 38 men on Friday night and 225 more as a Christmas goodwill gesture on Sunday night .

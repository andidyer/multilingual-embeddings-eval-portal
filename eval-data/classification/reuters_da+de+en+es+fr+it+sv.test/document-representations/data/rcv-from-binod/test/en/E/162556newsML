Exile finds market for guide to business in Cuba . Shipping magnate Teo Babun ' s last sight in Cuba was a policeman ' s knife plunging into the belly of his little sister ' s doll in a last check for currency before the two children were shipped in exile to Miami . The executive , who would grow up to head his family ' s Bahamas Line shipping company and is president of Cuba - Caribbean Development Co . , a consultancy with offices in Washington and Miami , has no love for Cuba ' s communist government , which seized his family ' s businesses and his childhood home 36 years ago . But as a businessman , Babun has found a ripe market for his expertise on Cuban trade and the island ' s economy . He said that any executive interested in opportunities on the island after its Communist government falls would do well to put aside any emotional issues to prepare for that day now . " I ' ve always been an advocate , possibly because I ' m a businessman , that if we ' re to be involved and participate in the reconstruction of Cuba in any way , that we have to use the same mechanics that we business people use to invest anywhere else in the world , " he said in a recent interview . " And we have to take some of the emotions up and we have to learn what ' s in Cuba today , to start with . If we don ' t know what we ' re facing , if we don ' t know the demographics and the industrial base and know a little bit about the labour force and the history and the laws , etc . , we ' re just asking for trouble , " he continued . For example , he noted that vegetable farmers in southern Florida could face stiff competition from Cuban growers shortly after the U . S . trade embargo was lifted . U . S . businesses interested in developing infrastructure for the island of 11 million people would face stiff competition from non - U . S . companies already working there , he said . But Babun stressed in the interview that his new book , " Business Guide to Cuba , " is intended not for those seeking business with the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro , but for businesses planning on trade with the island after the U . S . embargo against its government is lifted . " It is in fact a guide to businesses who are planning to do business in Cuba some time in the future when it ' s legal to do so , " he said . The 252 - page guide is the product of three years ' work , and includes 50 maps and an economic analysis by Ernest Preeg , a former U . S . ambassador now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . Babun also worked with Jose Oro , a consultant at Coopers & Lybrand who was Cuba ' s minister of mines in the early 1990s . Babun got the idea for the book in the early 1990s , after the Soviet Union collapsed , when he laid the groundwork for a private Cuban investment fund based on the hunch that the island ' s socialist government might soon falter without the backing of the Soviet Union . He said his studies have estimated that Cuba ' s market would be worth $ 5 billion in the first year after U . S . - Cuban trade relations are opened . After that , he estimated the market would grow " to somewhere in the neighbourhood of $ 12 to $ 15 billion . " Published in early October by The Miami Herald Publishing Co . , the book bears a healthy $ 300 price tag , but Babun said sales have been brisker than expected . " We anticipated that we would have maybe about 150 buyers overall , just based on people who are primarily interested in Cuba . And we already have sold more than 150 copies , so there is a bigger market than we anticipated , " Babun said . More than 90 percent of the buyers were companies , most of them large companies with prior interest in Cuba . He said about 40 percent of those companies were foreign . He said the industries that seemed most interested were energy , mining , cement , agriculture and chemicals .

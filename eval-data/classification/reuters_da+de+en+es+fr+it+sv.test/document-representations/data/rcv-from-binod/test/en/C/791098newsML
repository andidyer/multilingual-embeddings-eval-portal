COLOMBIAN PIPELINE REPAIRED , PUMPING RESTARTS . Repairs have been completed on Colombia ' s damaged Cano Limon - Covenas oil pipeline and pumping has restarted , sources at state - run oil company Ecopetrol said on Sunday . The line began pumping crude from the Cano Limon field operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp at rates of between 220 , 000 and 200 , 000 barrels a day , an operator at the main pumping station in Norte de Santander province told Reuters . The pipeline , the second largest in the country , had been out of action for 12 days since a leftist rebel dynamite attack on July 30 . It was then bombed twice and partially destroyed by a landslide four days later . " The damage was repaired and we restarted pumping overnight , " a pipeline pump station operator in northeast Cucuta told Reuters by phone . The Cano Limon field which produces an average of 175 , 000 barrels per day has been shut in since August 4 , when Occidental also declared force majeure on production . It was not immediately clear whether production at the field had restarted or whether an estimated 500 , 000 barrels contained in on - site storage tanks was being cleared first . Ecopetrol also declared force majeure on liftings at the Caribbean coast terminal at Covenas midway through last week . A spokesman said the crisis measure would not be lifted until supplies were replenished at Colombia ' s two main refineries at Barrancabermeja and Cartagena , which have a combined daily throughput of about 240 , 000 barrels a day .

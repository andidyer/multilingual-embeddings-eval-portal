Somali faction leaders to form central authority . Twenty - six Somali faction leaders meeting in Ethiopia said on Friday they would set up a " National Salvation Council " authorised to establish a provisional central government . But faction leader Hussein Aideed who claims he is Somalia ' s president is boycotting the meeting . The 26 leaders , in a declaration marking the end of an eight - week consultation process , appealed to Aideed and Mohamed Egal , leader of the self - declared Somaliland republic , to participate in the reconciliation process . " Somalia can be salvaged and its problems resolved only if its people are united and work together for the common good , " it said . The National Salvation Council ( NSC ) would be composed of 41 members selected from the 26 political movements with an 11 - member national executive committee led by five co - chairmen , the declaration said . All sections of Somali society would be invited to a national reconcilaition conference in Somalia to discuss the approval of a charter for the provisional central government . No date for the meeting was set . The leaders agreed to create a system of checks and balances to ensure government worked and to guarantee citizens ' individual liberties and democratic rights . And they appealed to the international community for support in national reconstruction . " Let us forget the past and direct our efforts towards rebuilding our nation shattered by six years of violence and bloodshed " , said faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed who controls north Mogadishu , at the closing ceremony . Hussein Aideed , a 34 - year - old former U . S . marine , succeeded his father Mohamed Farah Aideed on his death last August . He was elected president of Somalia by his supporters but he and his government are rejected by most other faction leaders .

U . S . grants Sinn Fein ' s Gerry Adams a visa . The United States on Thursday approved a visa for Gerry Adams , head of the Irish Republican Army ' s political wing Sinn Fein , saying it was in response to the IRA ' s latest cease - fire . U . S . officials said Adams was expected to visit Washington and New York , arriving Sept . 2 and returning home on Sept . 7 . State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had approved the visa request , lodged in Dublin on Aug . 11 , and there would be no restrictions on Adams ' raising funds in the United States . The visa is for three months and allows multiple entries . " He has been granted visa waivers in the past , based on a cease - fire . And so there is a cease - fire in place , and she granted that waiver this morning , " Rubin said . Adams made several trips to the United States in the period before the IRA ended an initial 17 - month cease - fire in February 1996 . This will be his first visit since March 1996 . Adams said in an interview with The New York Times published last weekend that he planned to spend six days in New York and Washington starting on Sept . 2 . " The U . S . trip is about enlisting support for a democratic peace settlement , for the notion of Irish unity , for an end to the British occupation " of Northern Ireland , he said . Adams was not expected to meet President Bill Clinton , who will be out of Washington on vacation . But he is expected to meet other administration officials and members of Congress . The IRA has fought a 28 - year violent campaign to try to end British rule in Northern Ireland . Adams is deemed ineligible for entry into the United States because of what U . S . officials say was " his previous involvement in terrorist activities . " As a result , he needs a waiver of that ineligibility and a visa , which most Irish and British citizens do not need , to visit the United States . Britain ' s Labour government insisted , like its Conservative predecessor , that an unequivocal cease - fire is a precondition for Sinn Fein to take part in peace talks in the province resuming later in September . Britain ' s Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether the IRA cease - fire declared on July 20 is considered sufficiently secure to allow Sinn Fein to take part . The all - party talks are the central plank of the Labour government ' s policy , most of which it inherited from the Conservatives who were defeated in May ' s general election . The talks , backed by London and Dublin and chaired by former U . S . Sen . George Mitchell , are meant to work out the province ' s constitutional and political future .

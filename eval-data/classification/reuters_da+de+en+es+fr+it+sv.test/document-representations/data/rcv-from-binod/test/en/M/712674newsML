Ivorian cocoa arrivals 1 . 05 - 1 . 06 mln T by July 4 . Arrivals of Ivory Coast ' s 1996 / 97 season cocoa crop ( Oct - Sept ) at ports totalled about 1 . 05 - 1 . 06 million tonnes by July 4 compared to around 1 . 148 million in the record 1995 / 96 season , port sources said on Tuesday . One set of data circulating in the market put the latest arrivals figure since October 1 at close to 1 . 05 million tonnes , but industry sources estimate the total to be closer to 1 . 06 million . " My figures had 1 . 06 ( million tonnes ) at June 22 , 1 . 05 sounds a bit low to me , " said one source . Deliveries had been trickling in at less than 5 , 000 tonnes a week after a slow June , they said . Volumes were expected to pick up during July and August as the end of the rainy season would help drying of beans and transport to port , they said . Figures from a different source put arrivals up to May 29 at 1 . 044 million tonnes , against 1 . 12 million in 1995 / 96 , indicating a potentially higher rate of arrivals . Ivory Coast produced a record 1 . 2 million tonnes crop in 1995 / 96 , with 1 . 16 - 1 . 67 tonnes delivered to ports by the end of July . Port sources said over 790 , 000 tonnes had been declared for export at the main port of Abidjan by this July 4 and close to 250 , 000 tonnes at the second , southwestern , port of San Pedro . The remainder had arrived but had not been declared for export . Crop analysts in June pointed to plenty of mid - crop ( May - Sept ) pods remaining on trees for July and August port delivery after a slow start to the mid - crop season . Crop forecasters initially estimated the 1996 / 97 mid crop to be in a 150 - 200 , 000 tonnes range . Some afterwards downgraded estimates but they say heavy June rains could have reversed any possible damage from earlier dry spells . Rains ahead of the record 1995 / 96 season continued throughout the annual July - August dry period but this year started to ease in late June . As 1996 / 97 mid - crop arrivals would be later than last year ' s record 200 , 000 tonnes some farmers might be tempted to hold some mid - crop in stores and speculate on a price rise in 1997 / 98 . Buyers estimate around 50 , 000 tonnes were carried into the 1996 / 97 main crop ( Oct - April ) from last year ' s mid - crop . Port sources put 1996 / 97 total bean exports to the end of June at around 960 , 000 tonnes . That included 130 , 000 tonnes of cocoa beans taken by local Ivorian processors for exported cocoa liquor , butter and powder production , they said . Ivorian factories can take up to around 160 , 000 tonnes a year of beans for processing . But exporters say the factories were unlikely to use more than 145 , 000 tonnes in 1996 / 97 . " That is about the capacity utilisation , " said one . More beans could be delivered to factories in future . Ivorian commodities minister Guy - Alain Gauze has said capacity will rise to 360 , 000 tonnes as new factory plans move into construction phases . Several companies have put up plans to build factories but few have been finalised . " Unless they are finalised , we are counting on 300 , 000 tonnes by 2000 , " one industry analyst told Reuters . - - Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90

Mexico passes political reform , draws opposition ire . Mexico ' s ruling party legislators passed a controversial electoral reform bill on Friday after watering down key provisions aimed at fairer elections and sparking the wrath of opposition parties . Lawmakers of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) used their majority to pass the bill by a 282 - 142 margin in the lower house . Every PRI legislator but one voted for the bill and every opposition politician voted against it , officials said . The bill was the product of nearly two years of painstaking negotiations between the parties and was backed heavily by President Ernesto Zedillo , who wants to trumpet cleaner elections as a step toward greater democracy in a country with notoriously dirty elections . But PRI deputies , normally presidential political pawns , staged a surprising rebellion , making last - minute changes to the bill in a bid to ensure the ruling party extends its 67 - year grip on power . The changes guaranteed the reform bill would pass without the support of the opposition , which has made unheard of gains against the PRI in recent elections due to Mexico ' s economic crisis and a string of PRI corruption scandals . Although a potential embarrasment for Zedillo , the president played down the rebellion in his ranks . " We took 18 months of political negotiation . . . to reach a constitutional electoral accord that I consider definitive , the last there will be during my government , " Zedillo told a business conference in Mexico City . PRI deputies altered the electoral reform bill so that exceeding campaign spending limits would no longer be an electoral offence punishable by law , but rather an " administrative error . " Coalitions between opposition parties were also severely restricted and plans for a special body to audit party finances in campaigns scrapped . By allowing the PRI to go it alone in the reform , Zedillo risks not delivering on one of his main campaign promises : to end post - electoral bickering in a country with an increasingly fragile political landscape . " The electoral reform approved by the PRI is not a real reform and will not guarantee democracy . It leaves open the risk of returning to fraudulent and hotly - contested elections , " Calderon told Mexico City ' s Reforma newspaper . " These reforms were being led by Zedillo . . . he is the chief of state and the head of the PRI . Progress was not made and the party backtracked on reforms because Zedillo wanted it that way , " said Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , head of the leftist PRD . PRI legislators have admitted they were upset by heavy losses in town hall elections last weekend and feared the party might lose its majority in Congress in next July ' s mid - term poll . " This is not a matter for the president of the republic , " said PRI legislator Jorge Moreno . " This is what we want . " Such fighting talk is common in countries with more independent legislatures but almost unheard - of from the PRI , created after the 1910 - 17 Mexican Revolution to serve as the institutional arm of the all - powerful presidency .

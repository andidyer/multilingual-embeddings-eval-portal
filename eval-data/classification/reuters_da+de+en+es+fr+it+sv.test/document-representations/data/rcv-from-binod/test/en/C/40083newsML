Eurotunnel ' s Morton sets deadline for debt deal . Alastair Morton , co - chairman of Anglo French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel , said on Monday he was allowing eight weeks for negotiations to secure a debt restructuring deal before he intends to quit the company . " I reckon there ' s about eight hours of serious negotiation left to do . So I ' ve allowed eight weeks for it . The banks have got plenty of time to get their act together and come to the table , " he said in a telephone interview . However , although Morton said Eurotunnel ' s view was that a deal was close , he said the banking syndicate did not appear to see the company ' s debts of more than eight billion pounds ( $ 12 . 5 billion ) in the same way . " All the pieces are on the table . They agree with us that all the pieces are on the table . . . it ' s just a matter of agreeing how to put them together , " he added . Although the company believes a deal can be done , and is achievable soon , he added : " ( The banks ' ) side of the picture is that it is all frightfully difficult and Eurotunnel refuses to give way on every point . " Morton was speaking after Eurotunnel announced results for the half - year to June 30 that reflected the continuing high level of junior debt interest that it is not paying . Morton has said he will remain at his post until the debt is restructured . Nevertheless , Morton ' s decision to declare that he will retire " around the end of October " suggests he is prepared to bring a personal dimension into the capitalisation issue . " Basically the job is done , " he said , justifying his deadline . " I said in 1992 that I wouldn ' t run the operating company . . . When we hit difficulties in 1994 , I said I would stay on to see the thing through to calmer waters . " We ' re now operating very smoothly , as the figures for the summer show . We ' ve got a good share of the summer market , so we ' ll get an even better share of the winter shopping market to come . The ferries have started the process of rationalisation . " All these factors , and his view that the various legal claims made by the company " are grinding their ways through the processes " made Morton sure that there was little more to do . " The company is making a profit , after depreciation and all other operating costs , so we ' re amortising the investment ( and ) we can look after the future capital programme - - we can look after oursevles in cash flow terms , " he went on . However , he said , the situation was still such that the company could not cover all its debt costs and so restructuring was the only way to make it possible for the banks to get back their money " over a much longer period than envisaged " . Shareholders , too , needed the restructuring to be able to get dividends , though he acknowleged that this would be " less than they might have had " . " We still hope to start ( dividends ) not far off the date which we promised , which was 2004 . " Even if a deal is struck soon , he added , banks and shareholders would still have to have to wait until the firm recovered its financial feet . " It will be some time next decade probably before it is able to make full interest payments and repayments on schedule plus dividends . But that ' s better than some people have been saying .

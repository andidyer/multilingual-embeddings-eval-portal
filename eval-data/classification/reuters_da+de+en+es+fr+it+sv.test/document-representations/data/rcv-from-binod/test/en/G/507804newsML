Bosnian Serb in first Swiss war crimes trial . Switzerland ' s first ever war crimes trial began on Monday amid confusion over the identity of a Bosnian Serb accused of torture and murder . A lieutenant - colonel presided over the trial of Goran Grabez , who appeared nervous on the first day of the proceedings which are expected to end on Friday . The 32 - year - old former driver from the Bosnian town of Prijedor faces a maximum 20 years jail if found guilty on four counts of war crimes committed at the Serb - run Omarska detention camp in northwestern Bosnia in July , 1992 . Under Swiss procedure , he was not immediately asked whether he pleaded guilty or not . Grabez was arrested two years ago in Geneva after Moslem refugees alleged he was a guard at Omarska and had tortured inmates . He denies the allegations , saying he was in Austria and Germany at the time . The defence has called Austrian witnesses to try to prove Grabez was there when the alleged offences took place . But a police official told the court Grabez appeared to have changed the date of an Austrian stamp on his passport . Monday ' s proceedings focused on the question of the defendant ' s identity . In written testimony , a Moslem survivor from the Omarska camp , and a former friend of Grabez , claimed to have seen the Bosnian Serb at the detention camp , armed and in uniform . But the witness failed to identify Grabez when shown a photograph of Bosnian Serb guards at Omarska , the court heard . There was also confusion over a Bosnian government letter asking Switzerland to arrest a man it named as Goran Karlica , not Grabez . The prosecutor , Major Claude Nicati , said although the prosecution had yet to ask for a sentence , Grabez faced up to 20 years in jail under the Swiss military penal code if found guilty . " This is the first war crimes trial in our history . We have to judge this man , " Nicati told Reuters . At times , the trial appeared to lack the gravity that might have been expected . The presiding judge , Lieutenant - Colonel Luc Hafner , interrupted the trial to joke when cannons were fired outside the building to celebrate a local holiday here . " Don ' t worry , the cannons have nothing to do with us , " he said , as other judges laughed .

Malta deposit bank expansion slows . The growth rate of Malta ' s deposit banks slowed in the third quarter of 1996 , the Malta Central Bank said in a report . At the end of September 1996 the consolidated balance sheet of the deposit money banks stood at 2 . 05 billion pounds , an increase of 68 million or 3 . 4 percent during the quarter compared to growth of 4 . 6 percent in the previous quarter . The slower growth rate was recorded despite the fact that the September figures incorporated , for the first time , the balance sheet of the Malta branch of Midland Bank Plc , the Central Bank said in its " Quarterly Review . " Residents ' deposits grew by 35 . 8 million to 1 . 43 billion , accounting for more than half of the increase in the sector ' s liabilities . Overall , deposit growth remained relatively stable , with growth of 2 . 6 percent in the third quarter only slightly higher than the 2 . 4 percent in the second quarter and 2 . 5 percent in the corresponding quarter in 1995 . Demand deposits grew by 2 . 9 million pounds or 3 . 5 percent to 87 . 5 million at the end of the third quarter while savings deposits rose by 1 . 5 percent to 510 . 5 million . The second quarter of 1996 had seen a sharp rise in demand deposits ( 15 . 1 percent ) because of a one - off reclassification of certain deposits by one band , an exercise which had also seen a 3 . 0 percent drop in savings deposits during that quarter . The Central Bank noted however that the growth in savings deposits in the third quarter was uneven , falling marginally in July and rising in August , probably in response to the issue of government stocks in July and September and the coming into force of lower income tax rates at the end of July . Time deposits maintained their upward trend in the third quarter , growing by 25 . 1 million pounfd 3 . 1 percent to reach 836 . 3 million . That growth rate was down from 4 . 9 percent in the second quarter , but higher than the third quarter of 1995 . Residents ' foreign deposits rose by 4 . 1 million , or 2 . 8 percent to 152 . 2 million in the third quarter , with foreign currency deposits accounting for just over 10 percent of total deposits . The deposit money banks ' foreign liabilities rose by 10 . 6 million , or 5 . 5 percent , to reach 204 . 8 million during the quarter , mostly due to a syndicated loan agreement entered into by one bank with a consortium of international banks in August . The increase was much smaller than the 17 . 0 percent recorded in the previous quarter . " As the local banks become more active in overseas money markets , borrowing and lending funds abroad , their foreign assets and liabilities are becoming increasingly volatile " the Central Bank said . The deposit banks ' other liabilities rose by 21 . 6 million , or 7 . 0 percent to 329 million compared to a 9 . 0 percent in the second quarter . This was caused mainly by a continuous upward trend in accrued interest and current profits , although deposits placed with their parent banks by offshore subsidiaries also contributed . Capital and reserves were unchanged at 86 million the Central Bank said . ( $ = 0 . 36 pound )

Heroin from Latin America threatens United States . The smuggling of heroin from Latin America to the United States is surging as big potential profits tempt drug gangs to diversify from their traditional export , cocaine , anti - narcotics agents say . Latin America , primarily Colombia , is challenging Asia as the main supplier of heroin to the United States , they say . " We are seeing more and more trafficking in heroin , " Pam Brown , spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Agency in Miami , said . " There ' s a lot of concern about that . " Among the worries are that the heroin is unusually pure and growing numbers of teenagers and students are using it . In the early 1990s , drug lords such as Burma ' s Khun Sa , operating in the Golden Triangle area of southeast Asia , supplied more than 90 percent of the heroin used in the United States . In the past two years Latin American traffickers have made significant inroads . DEA figures show 62 percent of the heroin seized in the United States was from Latin America in 1995 , up from zero in 1992 . Figures for this year are not in but DEA officials say the trend continues . " We ' ve seen a sharp increase in heroin production in Colombia , " Brown said . The reason is simple - - money . A kilogram of cocaine is worth about $ 18 , 000 wholesale in the United States . A kilogram of heroin is worth between $ 80 , 000 and $ 100 , 000 , she said . Most of the heroin smuggled in through Miami , the " command and control center " of Latin American drug gangs , in Brown ' s words , is destined for the north and east of the country . Drug Abuse Warning Network figures show a 19 percent increase in heroin incidents in U . S . hospital emergency rooms . " Heroin overdoses by rock musicians , young stockbrokers and models capture today ' s headlines , " a recent DEA briefing paper said . " But we ' re also hearing about mothers of perfect college students who ' never did drugs ' watching as their brain dead daughters die , and about the bodies of two 18 - year - old Orlando young men dumped in an apartment to die by their pusher when they became ill . " In Florida ' s Orlando area , heroin is suspected in the deaths of 13 people , five of them teenagers , in the past 15 months . Most is smuggled in small quantities by " swallowers " - - people who hide the drugs in their bodies by consuming bags - - unlike the cargo loads brought in by cocaine traffickers . " What ' s frightening is that it ' s an outstanding product . We are not going to get a handle on it until we get some big seizures , " a DEA official said . " They don ' t have a good processing system yet . But they already have some very nice poppy fields , " he added . Most of the smuggling is carried out by small , independent operators and the involvement of major cartels such as the Medellin cartel is limited , DEA officials say . " We are seeing some cocaine cartel involvement , but it ' s small scale . The cartels haven ' t jumped in with both feet yet , " James McGivney , a DEA spokesman in Washington , said . While the number of seizures is evidence of greater Latin American heroin smuggling , it does not necessarily mean they have a comparable share of the market . " The southeast Asians are still in it big time , " McGivney said . " They are still working hard . "

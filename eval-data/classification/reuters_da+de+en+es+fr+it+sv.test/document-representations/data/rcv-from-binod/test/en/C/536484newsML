FOCUS - Fast - growing businesses fuel IBM profit . International Business Machines Corp . Wednesday reported better - than - expected profits as its faster - growing services and PC businesses offset a decline in mainframes , minicomputers and workstations . IBM reported net income of $ 1 . 19 billion , or $ 2 . 37 a share , compared with earnings of $ 1 . 20 billion , or $ 2 . 21 a share , a year ago , excluding acquisitions - related charges . Including the charge , first - quarter 1996 earnings were $ 774 million , or $ 1 . 41 a share a year ago . The Armonk , N . Y . - based computer giant ' s results beat the consensus Wall Street analyst forecast of $ 2 . 28 a share , according to the First Call service . Predictions had ranged from $ 2 . 10 to $ 2 . 37 . Revenues rose 5 percent to $ 17 . 3 billion from $ 16 . 6 billion in last year ' s quarter . Had it not been for the strong dollar - - which has put a dent in U . S . corporate earnings - - revenues would have risen 9 percent , IBM said . IBM Chief Financial Officer G . Richard Thoman told analysts in a conference call he " felt good " about the rest of the year and was " cautiously optimistic " about its hardware business for the rest of the year . He also noted that IBM was less reliant on big system hardware and had more revenues coming from areas like services , disk drives and PCs . " We were pretty pleased with it ( the quarter ) , " Thoman told Reuters in a phone interview . " If you were to tell people that the System / 390 and the AS / 400 had negative growth , people would say you will have a bad quarter . In this quarter , we had these things that offset those kind of negatives . " IBM had strength in fast - growth areas including services , personal computers and certain software , such as Lotus Notes and Tivoli systems management products , and its data storage business , particularly hard disk drives . That offset a decline in its mainframe , minicomputer and workstation business due to product transitions and weakness in Europe . " The server business has dropped to 11 percent of revenues , " said Gary Helmig , a SoundView Financial analyst . " You can have problems there and with a lot of things still strong , it was a good quarter . I wouldn ' t call it a blow - out , but it was a clean way of slightly exceeding consensus . " IBM said North American results rose 14 percent from the year - ago first quarter to $ 7 . 9 billion , Asia - Pacific region revenues rose 3 percent to $ 3 . 4 billion and Latin America rose 2 percent to $ 701 million . Revenues from Europe , the Middle East and Africa , however , dropped 7 percent to $ 5 . 3 billion . Had it not been for the stronger dollar , Asia - Pacific revenues would have climbed 14 percent and 1 percent in Europe , the Middle East and Africa . Hardware sales totaled $ 7 . 8 billion in the first quarter , essentially flat vs . the same period in 1996 . Personal computer and PC - based server computer revenues increased , while RS / 6000 workstation , AS / 400 minicomputer and System / 390 mainframe revenues fell , the computer maker said . " It looks like they can make the numbers , even though hardware revenues were flat , " said Frank Dzubeck , president of Communications Network Architects in Washington . " Will the bears come out now and say this wasn ' t good ? I don ' t know . " Dzubeck added that IBM ' s second half should be very strong . IBM said it will roll out new AS / 400 minicomputers in the second half , which will help the AS / 400 sales recover . Thoman also said a much anticipated mainframe upgrade will begin to ship to some customers in June . Some analysts labeled the quarter as disappointing , due in part to a big drop in hardware profit margins to 32 . 4 percent of revenues , from 35 . 1 percent . " The gross margin falling in hardware was not a good sign , " said Daniel Ries , a Nomura Research analyst . " Outside of PCs , hardware was worse than expected . " He said IBM ' s lower tax rate and fewer number of shares outstanding due to its recent share buyback plans helped it exceed estimates . Another unexpected growth area was in its storage business , which increased an unspecified amount , due partly to continued strong sales of hard disk drive products . First - quarter services revenues rose 28 percent from a year earlier to $ 4 . 1 billion . IBM said it signed services deals worth $ 3 billion in the first quarter . Software revenues declined to $ 2 . 9 billion overall , down 3 percent . Shipments of Tivoli systems management products used to manage the networked computer systems of large enterprises more than doubled year - over - year , it said . The Lotus Notes installed base of users rose by about 1 . 7 million seats , or computer users , bringing the total installed base of computers running Lotus Notes to 11 million seats . Maintenance revenues , which are largely associated with servicing IBM ' s vast mainframe computer business , declined 8 percent to $ 1 . 6 billion , while revenues from rentals and financing rose 4 percent to $ 899 million . " The quarter should not be construed as disappointing , " said William Milton , a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst . " You can find disappointments if you look , but at every step they balance that with an upside surprise . "

Indian coalition says Congress revokes power claim . India ' s United Front coalition said on Friday that its ally - turned - rival Congress party had withdrawn a claim to form a new government , clearing the way for the alliance to choose a new prime minister . Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu told reporters that Congress party president Sitaram Kesri had written to President Shankar Dayal Sharma revoking a March 31 letter staking a claim to power . " We have received a letter from Sitaram Kesri saying that he has written to the president , " Naidu told reporters after a meeting of senior United Front leaders . Asked if Kesri had withdrawn his claim to form India ' s next government , Naidu said : " Yes . " Congress leaders were not immediately available for comment . Leftwing parties in the United Front had demanded that Kesri revoke his March 31 claim before the coalition would name a new leader to replace caretaker Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda and head a new government . Congress triggered Deve Gowda ' s downfall in a vote of confidence last week after it revoked its crucial support for his 10 - month - old government . Kesri had said he had no designs on power and would support a new United Front leader as prime minister , but he wanted to wait until the United Front replaced Deve Gowda before formally withdrawing the letter . Congress had maintained that if it revoked the letter prematurely , the rightwing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) could stake its own claim . The United Front said that its standing committee of senior leaders agreed at a meeting on Friday that Kesri ' s letter cleared the way for talks within the United Front over a new leader . " After having been satisfied with the contents of the letter , the standing committee decided that consultations among all the 15 constituents of the front will take place about the choice of the new leader , " United Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy said . The United Front ' s decision - making Steering Committee was scheduled to meet at 9 : 30 p . m . ( 1600 GMT ) to try to pick a new leader . Asked when a successor to Deve Gowda would be chosen , Naidu said : " Tonight at the earliest . " Jaipal Reddy said : " We hope to complete the exercise soon , latest by this night or tomorrow morning . "

GOLD - Indian sub - continent prices seen falling . Gold prices are expected to fall further in the Indian sub - continent in the current week under selling pressure exerted by subdued world trends , dealers said on Monday . Dealers in Bombay said a steep fall in world prices would not result in higher imports of gold by India , the world ' s largest consumer of the yellow metal . " Nobody is importing gold despite a fall in prices in world markets mainly because there is no demand , " said Bhayabhai Sanghavi , a leading bullion dealer . On the London market , bullion was fixed at $ 334 . 05 per ounce on Monday , down from $ 336 . 55 on Friday afternoon , which was the lowest fix since April 1 , 1993 . The slide began in New York on Friday , when speculative commodity funds began to unload gold from their portfolios on to a reluctant market . Indian demand dried up with the end of the wedding season in May and the onset of monsoon rains in June which triggered a frenzy of agricultural activity across the country . " Indian prices are also falling in line with world prices . So there is no margin left for importers , " Sanghavi said . Standard gold prices fell 50 rupees to 4 , 550 rupees per 10 gram in the week to Monday . In Karachi , Pakistan ' s main commercial city , gold prices are likely to remain soft amid low demand for jewellery and dwindling prices on international gold markets , dealers said . " Gold demand is very low , " dealer Farooq Qureshi said and added : " People don ' t have ( money ) to eat how will they buy gold . " In Dubai , the feeder market for the Indian sub - continent , traders are looking for a recovery in gold demand in India in July now that the monsoon season has started in earnest . Traders said heavy rainfall in India in the past week , along with low international gold prices , was a good sign for gold demand in the coming weeks . " I see good demand in July and August because the farmers will then be cash - rich with the harvest and seasonal wedding demand will begin again , " he added . India ' s June to September monsoon season is the prelude to the start of the country ' s main wedding season when imports from key supply markets , particularly Dubai , increase .

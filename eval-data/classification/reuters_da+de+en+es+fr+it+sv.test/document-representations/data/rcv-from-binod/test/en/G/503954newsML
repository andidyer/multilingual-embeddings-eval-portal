Kinkel declines all comment on Iran ties . German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel kept a low profile on Friday , declining all comment on relations with Iran the day after a Berlin court accused Iranian leaders of ordering the murder of four Kurdish dissidents . Kinkel , posing for photographers after a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski , was deluged by reporters ' questions on relations with Iran . " I don ' t want to say anything - - for good reasons , in such a charged situation , " Kinkel responded . The court ' s verdict plunged ties between the European Union and Tehran into crisis . The EU invited its members to follow Germany ' s lead in recalling its ambassador in Tehran and suspending the policy of " critical dialogue " with Iran . Bonn and Iran also engaged in a round of tit - for - tat explulsions , each ordering out four diplomats . Iran has also recalled its Bonn ambassador for consultations . Germany , wary of possible reprisals for the Berlin verdict , has also advised its citizens not to travel to Iran . " I ask for understanding , " Kinkel said when pressed for a comment about Iran . " I can ' t say anything about this subject you ' re all so interested in . " In a statement on Thursday , Kinkel ' s ministry said the verdict portrayed a " flagrant violation of international law " . But it also said it hoped that the situation would not escalate . The verdict marked the first time a European court had clearly attributed political responsibility for any of the dozens of assassinations of Iranian opposition figures abroad since the Islamic revolution in 1979 . Presiding judge Frithjof Kubsch said in his ruling that the assassination of four Kurdish Iranian leaders in 1992 was ordered by a secret special operations committee whose members included Iran ' s president , its religious leader , Intelligence Minister and the head of foreign policy . Kubsch stopped short of explicitly naming Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who had been accused by prosecutors of ultimate responsibility for the attack in Berlin ' s Mykonos restaurant . Iran has denounced the verdict as unfounded . Of the Iranian leaders , Kubsch mentioned only one by name - - Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan . Fallahiyan had asked Bonn to put off the trial when he was received here just before it opened , and is now being sought on an arrest warrant for allegedly masterminding the murders . Germany has been a staunch advocate of " critical dialogue " , a policy which means maintaining good relations and trade ties with Iran while also engaging in dialogue over human rights . The policy is viewed with suspicion in Washington . The U . S . government favours a policy of completely isolating Iran , which it accuses of sponsoring international terrorism .

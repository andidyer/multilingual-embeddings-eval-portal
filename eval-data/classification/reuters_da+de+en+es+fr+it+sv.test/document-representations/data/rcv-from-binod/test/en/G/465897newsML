Earthquake measuring 5 . 3 shakes Chilean capital . A powerful earthquake measuring 5 . 3 on the Richter scale rocked the Chilean capital of Santiago on Monday , causing power cuts and panic among residents but no serious damage or injuries . The quake sent alarmed residents running out of their homes throughout the city when it struck at 9 : 14 p . m . local time ( 0015 GMT ) . The tremor , which lasted 45 seconds , caused minor damage to buildings and landslides on roads leading to ski resorts in the Andes east of the city . The epicentre was around 48 miles ( 80 km ) beneath the centre of Santiago , local officials said . Initial measurements showed the quake measuring five to six on the Mercali scale throughout the city centre , said Carmen Fernandez , head of services of the National Emergency Office . The Mercali scale measures the intensity of the earth ' s movement in a particular place , whereas the Richter scale measures the amount of energy released at the epicentre . The quake ' s intensity diminished in the areas surrounding the city , said Fernandez . " We have not had any reports of any injuries to people , " she added . The tremor was not felt in Chile ' s vital copper mines , most of which lie in the arid north of the country . Fernandez said it was too soon to say whether the city would be shaken by any aftershocks from the quake . Santiago was last struck by a major earthquake in March 1985 which caused deaths and serious damage to buildings in the older districts of the city .

No slowdown in Manila property prices in 97 - Ayala . Ayala Corp President Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala said on Monday that property prices in Manila are unlikely to fall in 1997 , despite widespread predictions of a slowdown after three years of sustained growth . " I don ' t believe that cycle will hit us this year , " he told Reuters in an interview . " However , in 1998 there ' s a good chance that there could be some plateauing of prices . " Ayala , who is also president of Ayala Land , the top real estate company in the country , said there had never been a steep drop in prices since he started working in 1981 . " There have been rises and plateaus , rises and plateaus . We ' ve never seen a major decline . " He said there was a lot of construction in the Makati district , the prime commercial area of the capital , and those properties could come on the market in 1998 . " There could be an adjustment there and some plateauing , but I don ' t see it this year , " he said . Ayala said the development of the Fort Bonifacio area of the city , a former military base , is unlikely to provide new properties on the market in the near future . The contract to develop Fort Bonifacio was won by Metro Pacific Corp , a unit of Hong Kong ' s First Pacific Co Ltd , which beat other bidders including Ayala land . " That ( a move to Bonifacio ) could take place between two and five years from now . I don ' t think we will see it in the near future . " - - Manila newsroom ( 632 ) 841 8914

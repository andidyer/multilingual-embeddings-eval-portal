Oracle ' s second quarter net income of $ 0 . 27 a share was $ 0 . 01 short of Wall Street ' s mean estimate of $ 0 . 28 a share , as tallied by First Call Corp . " I would have been happier with higher database server revenue growth , " said analyst Neil Herman of Salomon Brothers . He said Oracle executives told analysts on a conference call that database license revenue growth was 24 . 4 percent . That percentage growth might have been a couple points higher , Herman said , if it were not for unfavorable currency translations .

Catherine Buan , Oracle ' s director of investor relations , later confirmed that database license revenues grew 24 . 4 percent . " Business in the second quarter was different in different regions . Overall business was very good in the U . S . and Asia - Pacific , " Buan said . " Europe was not nearly that , " she continued , adding that Europe dragged down total growth . She said that growth in U . S . and Asia database revenues was in the " 30s - to - 40s " percentage range . Applications license sales rebounded , Buan noted , and the current quarter has a full pipeline of orders , she said .

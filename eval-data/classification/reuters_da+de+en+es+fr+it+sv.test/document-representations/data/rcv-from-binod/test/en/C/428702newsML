UAE to establish new Islamic bank , says magazine . The United Arab Emirates is next month expected to announce the establishment of a new Islamic bank in the Gulf Arab state , a magazine said on Saturday . The proposed Emirates Islamic Bank ( EIB ) will operate with capital of three billion dirhams ( $ 817 . 4 million ) , higher than any other bank in the oil - rich UAE , the weekly Emirates Today quoted sources as saying . It will be set up in the capital Abu Dhabi . Emirates Today said the official announcement is expected next month following cabinet approval . " A founders ' committee will be formed immediately after the cabinet ' s approval to allocate their share in the capital which is 45 percent and float the remaining 55 percent for public subscription which is expected to be covered within a few days . . . " it said . Islamic banks do not deal in interest - - the core of the Western banking system - - as it is regarded by many Moslems as usury , banned under Islamic sharia law . The 20 - year - old industry has so far attracted about $ 80 billion in funds from devout Moslems . Islamic banks have become more popular among the world ' s one billion Moslems , but the more than 185 financial institutions which strictly adhere to the principles of Islamic sharia law face hurdles to lure more funds , bankers say .

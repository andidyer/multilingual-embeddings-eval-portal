Reynolds falls 8 . 24 pct on tariff issue . Aluminium producer Reynolds Philippines Corp shed 14 centavos , or 8 . 24 percent , to 1 . 56 pesos in late trade as the market reacted to the company saying tariff cuts in aluminium imports was hurting its business . " It ' s on the tariff cut issue , " said Saturnino Mejia , research head at Guoco Securities . Reynolds president Jaime Gonzales said last week that as early as the last quarter of 1996 , Reynolds had suffered a substantial decrease in volume sales brought about by the anticipated reduction in the tariff for 1997 . " Some people believe their margins have been so good , it is just impossible to sustain them with falling tariff , " said one foreign broker . All Asia Securities research head Helen Alvarez said the share may also have fallen because the firm ' s first quarter earnings of 33 . 09 million pesos was slightly below the company ' s forecast . The government cut tariffs on imported aluminum foil , sheets , strips and coils to 10 percent at the start of the year from the previous 20 percent . Reynolds , the country ' s sole manufacturer of aluminum sheets and foils , is asking for the tariff to be restored to 20 percent . - - Manila newsroom ( 63 2 ) 8418939 Fax 8176267

Turk ministry says scandal MP report incomplete . The Turkish Justice Ministry on Friday rejected as incomplete a prosecutor ' s report that could open the way for the prosecution of a government MP in a security scandal linking the state , police and underworld gangs . State - run Anatolian news agency said the ministry returned the report back to the Ankara prosecutor . The report asked that the legal steps be taken to lift deputy Mehmet Agar ' s parliamentary immunity . Agar , who quit as interior minister in November over the scandal , was accused this week of having signed a false police identity document for a fugitive gangster allegedly used by officials to kill Turkey ' s political opponents . The scandal broke on November 3 when a truck collided with a car carrying a government MP who heads an anti - guerrilla Kurdish militia , a wanted gangster and a leading policeman . Only the government MP survived .

FOCUS - French left win could spook , then boost Paris stocks . If the left win the French parliamentary election the Paris bourse could slide in a knee - jerk reaction but rise in the longer term , share analysts said on Monday . Were the current centre - right majority to win the May 25 and June 1 two - round poll , the share market would stay in its current valuation range . But in the unlikely event of a more liberal centre - right government team being put in power after the elections , the share market could rally , they said . Francois Langlade - Demoyen , market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London , said that if a Socialist and Communist coalition won there would be an immediate fall in share prices of at least 10 percent . " There are four main dangers . The postponement or cancelling of tax reforms , the end of moves towards greater labour flexibility , the postponement or cancelling of the privatisation programme and the postponement or cancelling of creating pension funds , " he said . The Socialists have said they would stop the current privatisation programme , mainly the June France Telecom sale , and scrap a pension fund law allowing the creation of private pensions which would be able to invest in shares . For him , a more economically liberal government which would increase labour market flexibility and promote shareholder value would be a boon to the market . " This scenario has the lowest probability , " he said , adding he would " massively increase " his end - of year target for the CAC - 40 index from his current 2 , 650 goal . Gary Dugan , market strategist at J . P . Morgan in London , said that if the left were to win there would be a negative knee - jerk reaction " but in a six month period it could be positive " . Dugan said that if a Socialist government were perceived as willing to let the franc slip slightly this could boost shares . J . P . Morgan recently changed its recommendation for France to " neutral ' from " underweight " and Dugan said the investment bank would reiterate the rating after the election , even if the Socialists won . Jacques Chahine , who tracks analysts ' s and fund managers ' opinions in France , said if the Socialists won , French fund managers see the CAC - 40 falling to 2 , 400 and the 10 - year government bond rate rising to 6 . 5 percent , from 5 . 58 percent now . If the centre - right would remain in power , the CAC - 40 could go to 2 , 950 - 3 , 000 with the long rate down to 5 . 5 percent " There is still a lot of potential in the French stock market where profits are seen rising more than in other countries , " Chahine said . A victory by the current centre - right team would , according to Langlade - Demoyen , lead to a short term and short - lived five percent increase . " Nice for a trader but for portfolio managers the situation remains unchanged , " he said . Such a win would favour industries like the banking and insurance sector , steel and cars , retailing while it would weigh on the health sector , he said . Michel Lutfalla , director of economic research at insurance group AXA , said that the markets were not afraid of a Socialist win because they believed the party had to be pragmatic and could not implement its entire programme . The French stock market has not yet reacted much to the election campaign . The blue - chip CAC - 40 index closed at 2 , 522 . 67 on April 21 before President Jacques Chirac called the snap poll , rose to a close at 2 , 651 . 93 on May 6 before slipping on opinion polls giving the centre - right a narrow lead . On Monday it stood at 2 , 690 . 32 , up 56 . 41 , or 2 . 14 percent , at around 1445 GMT .

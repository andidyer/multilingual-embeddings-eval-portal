Crucifix plant launched bloody Peru hostage raid . More details of Peru ' s James Bond - style hostage rescue emerged on Sunday as sources revealed that a captive retired navyman tipped off troops to the right moment for the bloody attack via a microphone planted in a crucifix . Former navy Rear Adm . Luis Giampietri gave the signal on Tuesday for commandos to explode out of tunnels and storm into the Japanese ambassador ' s home to rescue 72 hostages , security force sources said . Giampietri passed the early weeks of the 126 days he was holed - up in the mined and booby - trapped mansion establishing a link with Peru ' s intelligence service by speaking aloud to test possible bugs that had been smuggled into the house . Talking into flowers , lamps and even the toilet - basin proved in vain . But then one of the many people permitted to enter the mansion by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels advised him to test a crucifix , a police source said . Giampietri spoke into the crucifix and knew he had made contact with the outside when his instruction to the military to change the music it was playing was obeyed . He requested that the martial music blasting each day from loudspeakers placed around the diplomatic compound be changed to a selection of Mexican folk songs . The music - - used to cloak the noises of the tunnels ' construction - - changed . Giampietri then passed on a second message to let the military know the number of a beeper that another hostage had switched on despite the rebels ' searches . The combination of the crucifix and the beeper set up a two - way communication that allowed the 72 hostages to receive a warning minutes before the bloody assault . The warning allowed them time to clear passages to exits and helped them react calmly amid the explosions and bullets . The collaboration with Giampietri - - informing him where the bug was hidden - - led to the rescue of all but one of the 72 hostages . It was not known who tipped off Giampietri or who took the crucifix into the residence . Peace talks guarantors , Catholic Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani , Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent , Red Cross officials and visiting doctors frequently entered the mansion during the 18 - week siege . The attack has provoked a rash of accusations that Peruvian commandos executed two captured rebels , but President Alberto Fujimori vehemently denied the charges . But a former hostage , a commando who took part in the raid , military , police and rebel sources have suggested that troops shot to death two unarmed rebels they had caught and held in an upper - story room of the mansion . All the MRTA rebels , two commandos and one hostage , a local judge , died in the battle , which lasted 16 minutes . Troops who had waited for two days in tunnels before Giampietri ' s signal crashed through the floor of a reception room where at least half of the 14 rebels were playing soccer . The remarkable lowering of the rebels ' guard was born of an over - confidence that Fujimori would not order an attack . They believed peace talks were edging toward a conclusion , a source close to the negotiations said . The lapse was especially surprising as MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa claimed to know the tunnels existed when , weeks beforehand , he called off a scheduled round of talks saying the rebels had heard banging underneath the house . In response to that discovery , the rebels kept their prize hostages in different rooms and planted more mines around the house , former hostage police Col . Marco Miyashiro said in an unpublished interview obtained by Reuters . Cerpa , who took part in the ill - fated soccer game , had grown lax in the final days of the 18 - week siege , according to the close friend of a key hostage who has not spoken publicly but was in regular contact with Cerpa during the saga . The MRTA leader was holding out for the freeing of 20 of his jailed comrades - - a reduction from his original demand of 450 releases . The government ' s final negotiating position had been to free 12 guerrillas , the source said . Miyashiro said Cerpa had expected the siege to last until at least May 1 . The Marxist rebels had prepared a statement to issue from the residence celebrating the date traditionally marked by leftist groups , he said . They also aimed to broadcast a message on April 28 to mark the anniversary of a battle that the hostage - takers often sang about . The MRTA , which lost more than 60 fighters in the 1989 " Los Molinos " battle with the military , has in the past marked Monday ' s anniversary with attacks .

Canadian dollar seen strengthening in 1997 . A blistering rally that boosted the Canadian dollar by more than one U . S . cent in the first week of 1997 is expected to lift the currency by more than six cents this year to around 80 U . S . cents . Economists and analysts said on Wednesday the dollar rally would be fueled by solid Canadian economic growth that could compel the Bank of Canada to raise short - term interest rates by up to one percentage point this year . " If so , the way should be clear for a potentially powerful appreciation in the CAD ( Canadian dollar ) , " a recent report by brokerage Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said . Currency dealers noted the Canadian dollar had attracted a raft of buyers this year , with North American , European and Asian investors driving the unit close to 74 cents from less than 73 cents on Jan . 2 . " Since the beginning of the New Year we have most players back at their desks and there have been continued U . S . investment fund types buying the Canadian dollar , " said Stephen Wateridge , director of corporate foreign exchange at CIBC - Wood Gundy Inc . Canada ' s central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market on Tuesday to smooth the rise in the local currency by selling Canadian dollars just above the 73 - 1 / 2 cent mark , dealers said . Despite the intervention , the currency rally persisted on Wednesday with the dollar touching 74 cents late in the session . The unit closed at 73 . 98 cents on Wednesday . Deutsche Morgan ' s report , titled " Time to get into Canada " , gave a 12 - month forecast of about 80 cents . The report was based on the expectation that Canada ' s growth this year would outpace that of the United States due to the " massive " monetary stimulus of lower short - term rates over the last year and a half . It saw Canada ' s economic growth topping four percent this year , more than a point higher than U . S . growth and almost two points greater than the average growth of the other Group of Seven ( G7 ) countries . Analysts said Canada ' s growth spurt could cause the Bank of Canada to raise short - term interest rates to ward off a possible resurgence of inflation . " The U . S . economy is growing . . . but Canada has the opportunity to grow much faster than that , and interest rates are below equilibrium levels and will have to be pulled up , " said Andrew Spence , vice president and senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Canada Ltd . Canada ' s short - term interest rates as reflected by the government ' s three - month treasury bill yield are more than two points below those of the United States .

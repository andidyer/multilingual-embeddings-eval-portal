CRICKET - REFORMED BAD BOY TUFNELL WINS ENGLAND RECALL . Middlesex left - arm spinner Phil Tufnell was given a final chance to re - establish his England career on Tuesday when he was named in the 15 - man England squad to tour Zimbabwe and New Zealand . Tufnell , 30 , who played the last of his 22 Tests against Australia at Adelaide in January last year , has been left out of the England team since for disciplinary reasons . Still widely regarded as the best spinner in the country , he was selected for The Oval Test against West Indies last summer but omitted from the final line - up . This season Tufnell has responded by taking 74 wickets , more than any other English spinner , and claimed a career - best 13 for 123 against Lancashire , including the wicket of England captain Mike Atherton at Old Trafford last week . Chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth said Middlesex captain Mike Gatting had given Tufnell a glowing report for his efforts this season . " Michael Atherton spoke to Gatt at Old Trafford last week and he was assured that Tufnell had improved in the directions that we wanted him to improve , " Illingworth said . " Gatt ' s reference has turned the scales , the captain wanted him to go on tour . " Yorkshire fast bowler Chris Silverwood , 21 , wins selection ahead of Peter Martin and Dean Headley and will join Darren Gough , New Zealand - born Andy Caddick , Dominic Cork and Alan Mullally in the England pace attack . " We decided to take one young one who we believe has a future in the game , " Illingworth added . " He gives his all with his bowling and he enjoys his cricket . " Ronnie Irani has been given the all - rounder ' s role ahead of Adam Hollioake , who will captain the A team in Australia . Glamorgan off - spinner Robert Croft is also included after impressing against Pakistan in the third test at The Oval and subsequently during the one - day series .

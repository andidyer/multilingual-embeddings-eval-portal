Zaire rebels face fight in Kisangani - Mobutu aide . Tutsi rebels face their first real battle with the Zairean army if they try to seize the garrison city of Kisangani , a spokesman for President Mobutu Sese Seko said on Wednesday . Mobutu , convalescing in his French Riviera mansion after prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland last year , is due to return to Zaire late this week for a third time since December . " No precise day has been fixed , " spokesman Mobutu Nzanga , son of the president , told Reuters by telephone from the villa at Roquebrune - Cap - Martin , adding that either Friday or Saturday was likely . " All is well " with the president ' s health , he added . He said Tutsi rebels who have been predicting the imminent collapse of Kisangani , the capital of the northeast and main rebel target , would face fierce resistance after little opposition in a five - month advance from Zaire ' s eastern borders . " I think that they will face a first real conflict with the Zairean army if they try to capture the town , " he said . The rebels " have been saying that they ' re at the gates of the city for four days . They ' ve used the media well , with a lot of bluff , " he said . " Before this they advanced through towns without real effort , " he said , accusing the rebels of having massacred Hutu refugees along the way , a charge they deny . Zaire ' s poorly - equipped , mercenary - backed army has so far put up only token resistance in eastern Zaire and some analysts doubt whether it has the morale to rally for what many in Zaire view as a last stand to defend Kisangani . Mobutu Nzanga declined to estimate how many Zairean troops were in the town , saying only that there were several army units and that it was the headquarters for a counter - offensive . He brushed aside questions about what Mobutu might do if Kisangani fell , reiterating that the president was interested in a peaceful solution to the conflict . " That doesn ' t mean he wants to talk to ( rebel leader Laurent ) Kabila , " he added . He said the president was in constant contact with the government in Zaire . When he flew home , Mobutu would probably travel to the capital Kinshasa rather than his home town Gdabolite . Mobutu Nzanga also complained about what he called the " lack of commitment by the international community " in failing to help resolve the crisis in the former Belgian colony . A break - up of Zaire would destabilise the entire region , he said . " Can you imagine an explosion of Zaire ? We have nine neighbours . Those are the immediate consequences that would follow a supposed explosion of Zaire , " he said . He also renewed charges that Uganda , Burundi and Rwanda were directing the uprising - - something those nations deny . " It ' s a Tutsi coalition , " he said . " They put Zairean guys to lead it . . . in reality they are Ugandan troops , Burundi troops and Rwandan troops . "

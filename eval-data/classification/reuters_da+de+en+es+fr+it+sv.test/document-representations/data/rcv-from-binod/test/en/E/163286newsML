Kenya aims to cut high interest rates . The Kenyan finance minister and central bank have outlined measures to reduce runaway interest rates to boost investment and create jobs . The government plans to tighten spending controls , improve revenue collection and start a switch to long - term borrowing and away from short - term treasury bills . " The government has noted with concern the prevailing domestic interest rate structure . The current interest rate levels are too high to stimulate investment , " Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said in a statement obtained on Monday . " It is therefore imperative that interest rates come down if we are to achieve the desired level of investment to create enough employment opportunities , " Mudavadi added . Officials at the Central Bank of Kenya said they were accepting only a small fraction of bids for treasury bills because investors were asking for high interest rates . " We have a desired ceiling . That ceiling is meant to help in the bringing down of interest rates , " an official told Reuters . Mudavadi said the government planned to reduce its domestic debt by 8 . 2 billion shillings ( $ 147 . 2 million ) during the last quarter of 1996 to ease pressure on demand for domestic credit and " this in turn will facilitate a reduction in rates " . Mudavadi did not say what the domestic debt stood at . He listed measures to dampen government demand for credit , including collection of revenue arrears and improved surveillance to prevent evasion particularly of customs and value added taxes . He also directed parastatals to invest their surplus funds in long - term government instruments and ordered strict enforcement of quarterly ministerial expenditure ceilings to ensure that the overall expenditure was in line with revenue . Other measures were the sale , with effect from January 1 , 1997 , of long - term bonds with floating interest rates . The proceeds will be used to be used to retire treasury bills . The government also plans to establish a central depository system to enhance liquidity of government securities and to introduce repurchase agreements ( repos ) . Mudavadi said : " We appeal to commercial banks to take steps to enhance efficiency of their operations . This will go a long way to complement government efforts to bring the rates down . " Last week , the central bank accepted bids for only 1 . 489 billion shillings of treasury bills out of 9 . 0 billion it tendered . The week before that , the central bank had accepted 321 . 95 million shillings of treasury bills from a total 9 . 0 billion shillings it tendered . An official said some investors had asked for " ridiculous " interest rates which it would not encourage . " Our cut level appears very low again this week but that is due to our commitment to keeping the interest rates down , " a central bank official said on Thursday when the central bank offered an average interest rate of 22 . 497 percent percent for its main category 91 - day treasury bills from 23 . 424 previously . Commercial bank lending rates currently stand in the 24 - 30 percent range . Interest on deposits is around 10 - 16 percent . Nairobi Stock Exchange chairman Jimnah Mbaru and other business leaders have complained that interest rates are far too high , undermining efforts to achieve a growth target of 6 . 0 percent for gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 1996 .

Syrian radio says Israel massing troops in Lebanon . Syria ' s state - run radio on Tuesday accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of acting against peace and of massing more troops in south Lebanon and the Golan Heights . Damascus Radio , which reflects government thinking , said Israel wanted Arabs to submit to Israeli demands and to abandon their lands , adding that Damascus would not change its conditions for peace . " It is clear that Israel is in a dilemma due to the policy of its hardline leaders who adopted everything which is against peace , " the radio said in a political commentary . " The Israeli leaders are now trying to translate their hardline policy on the ground with the massing of more forces in south Lebanon and the Golan , " it said . " Israel ' s war ( defence ) minister is also continuing his provocative statements against Syria . Similar to his boss ( Netanyahu ) , he acts as if the Arab world is required to accept Israel ' s expansionist policies and adopt Israel ' s security pretexts , " the radio said . The comment follows recent mutual accusations by Syria and Israel that each was planning war . Israel and Syria have held sporadic peace talks since 1991 but no negotiations were conducted since Netanyahu took over in June . Syria ' s movement of thousands of troops in Lebanon last month from Beirut to near the border with Israel caused war jitters in the Jewish state . Damascus , which condemned Netanyahu ' s refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace , accused the Israeli premier of driving the region to more tension and instability . Syria wants Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights , occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war . Israel set up a 15 - km ( nine mile ) - wide south Lebanon occupation zone as a buffer against guerrilla attacks in 1985 . The radio said Arabs would reject Israel ' s attempts to force them to " abandon their lands and submit to Israel ' s will . " It said Arabs in general and Syria in particular had many options to counter Israel ' s policies , including the termination of ties with Israel and insisting on the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the region . It also threatened more cooperation with Palestinian guerrilla groups . " Syria has the option of coordinating closely with Lebanon , supporting the struggle of the Palestinian brothers , and working to promote joint Arab action . . , " the radio said . Syria hosts several Palestinian groups including a 10 - member alliance which vowed to wreck the Palestinian - Israeli peace deal .

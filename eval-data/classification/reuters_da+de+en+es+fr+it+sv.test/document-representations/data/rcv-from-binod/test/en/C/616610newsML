Chip price crash hits Japan electronics firms . Japan ' s leading electronics makers unveiled lacklustre annual earnings Tuesday as freefalling prices for computer memory chips cut sharply into their group profits . Toshiba Corp . , Fujitsu Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric Corp . all forecast an upturn in profits for the current business year , however , predicting that rapid growth in network computing and steady sales of personal computers will put their earnings back on track . Stable chip prices will also help to support their bottom line , the companies said . Mitsubishi was hit particularly hard last year when prices of 16 - megabit dynamic random access memory chips plunged 80 percent , just as the company was boosting capital investment in a German unit that produces the chips . In a one - two punch on its profit position , Mitsubishi was also hit by sagging prices of consumer electronics . " A plunge in 16 - megabit DRAM prices caused large losses in the chip business , particularly in our overseas units , " Mitsubishi Managing Director Masatoshi Umeda told a news conference . " We aim to post a profit ( in semiconductors in fiscal 1997 / 98 ) , but it might be very difficult to do so , " he added . Mitsubishi posted group net profits of 8 . 5 billion yen ( $ 73 . 2 million ) in the year ended March 31 , down sharply from 59 . 2 billion yen ( $ 510 million ) a year earlier . It expects profits to recover to 20 billion yen ( $ 172 million ) in the current business year , following a bottoming out in chip prices . Toshiba and Fujitsu said their chip divisions would become profitable in the current business year . But Fujitsu , with its strength in the communications and computer sectors , expected a particularly rapid recovery in profits this year . " All three of our divisions - - communications , computer and electronic components - - will post more than 10 percent growth in sales in the current business year , " Fujitsu Executive Vice President Keizo Fukagawa told a news conference . Fujitsu expected profit growth to be fuelled by strong demand for its advanced digital switching and fiber - optic transmission systems , used to support increased traffic on the Internet and mobile communications networks . The company ' s group net profits fell 26 . 9 percent to 46 . 1 billion yen ( $ 397 million ) in 1996 / 97 , but it predicted that profits will nearly double to 90 billion yen ( $ 775 million ) due to strong demand from the computer and communications sectors . Toshiba posted group net profits of 67 . 08 billion yen ( $ 578 million ) in 1996 / 97 , down 26 percent from a year earlier . A squeeze in public works spending , coupled with sluggish business in chips and consumer electronics , also dealt a blow to profits , Toshiba said . The company expects a moderate 11 . 8 percent gain in profits in 1997 / 98 , in part aided by prospects of strong PC sales . Toshiba , the world ' s top manufacturer of notebook PCs , said its PC sales are expected to rise 42 percent in 1997 / 98 , after an 80 percent gain the year before .

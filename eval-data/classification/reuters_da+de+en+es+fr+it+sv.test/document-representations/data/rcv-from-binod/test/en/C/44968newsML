RTRS - ANZ says plans MTN issue in U . S . Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ( ANZ ) said on Tuesday it planned a medium - term note issue of unspecified size in the United States later this week . The issue plans come on the heels of ratings agency Standard & Poor ' s Corp ' s ( S & P ) upgrade of the bank ' s long and short term counterparty credit ratings . " ANZ is planning a subordinated debt issue in the United States market this week . The upgrade will be positive for this issue , " ANZ chief financial officer David Craig said in a statement . Earlier today , S & P raised ANZ ' s short term rating to AA minus from A plus and its short term rating to A1 plus from A1 . A spokesman for the bank declined to give details of the issue , adding that to do so would breach U . S . Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regulations . He said the issue would draw on ANZ ' s shelf registration for up to US $ 1 billion in debt securities filed with the SEC last month . Combined with previous registrations , ANZ has filed for up to A $ 1 . 3 billion in debt securities . - - Melbourne bureau 61 - 3 9286 - 1435

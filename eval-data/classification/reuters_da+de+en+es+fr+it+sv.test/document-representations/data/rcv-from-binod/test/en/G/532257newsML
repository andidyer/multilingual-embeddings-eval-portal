U . S . says Zaire rebels ' ties with West at stake . The United States warned Zairean rebels on Wednesday that they could be damaging future relations with Western powers by failing to repatriate Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire . " If the rebel alliance would like to have normal relations with Western governments , they ' ve got to act in a credible way and a humanitarian way , and that doesn ' t seem to be the case right here , " State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . He told reporters the price for the rebels of not allowing the refugees to return home " is going to be to their reputation and credibility , and how the rest of the world looks upon them . This is of course a test . " U . N . Secretary - General Kofi Annan said on Wednesday he was " shocked and appalled by the inhumanity " of the followers of rebel leader Laurent Kabila in preventing aid from reaching up to 100 , 000 refugees . The refugees near the city of Kisangani are believed to be the last of hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled into Zaire fearing retribution when a Tutsi - run government came to power in Rwanda in 1994 . In a statement , Burns called on the rebels to allow relief agencies immediate access to the refugees and to permit their U . S . - funded airlift to Rwanda . He said reports of recent mass killings of refugees " are of grave concern . " Rebel leaders have cited security concerns about the refugees , some of whom are suspected of being members of Rwandan Hutu militias . But Burns said the rebels might at least let the women and children go . " The rebel alliance has to prove that it is responsible enough to handle a situation like this , " he said . Burns said the Rwandan government , which had until recently been blocking the return of the refugees , was now no longer doing so . The Zairean rebels " are responsible . There can be no further excuses for this , " he said .

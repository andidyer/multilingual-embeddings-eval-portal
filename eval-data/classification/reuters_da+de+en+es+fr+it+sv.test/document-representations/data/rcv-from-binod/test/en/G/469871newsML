India poll shows heavy backing for Pakistan talks . At least a third of Indians believe Pakistan should retain the one - third of Kashmir it controls , and New Delhi should grant the Himalayan region more autonomy , an opinion poll published on Wednesday said . Top diplomats from the neighbours and bitter foes are scheduled to meet from Friday for four days of talks that were broken off three years ago over the thorny issue of Kashmir . India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 over Kashmir , where a Moslem separatist revolt has been raging since 1990 . The opinion poll , published by Outlook newsmagazine , was conducted among 1 , 224 adults in six major cities . It showed that 33 percent of those polled favour Pakistan retaining the one - third of Kashmir it already controls . The two countries ' armies are separated by a fragile " line of control " in the Kashmir valley . Asked if India should make " minor adjustments " on the Kashmir border in order to placate Pakistan , 72 percent said " No . " Significantly , 53 percent of the Indians polled said New Delhi must continue with the peace talks even if Pakistan insisted on focusing the March 28 - 31 talks entirely on Kashmir . No formal agenda has been set for the talks . The last foreign secretary - level talks in 1994 bogged down over Kashmir as Pakistan insisted that it be the main focus of negotiations . India wanted a broader negotiating palette . Asked what they felt was a solution to the Kashmir standoff , 51 percent of those polled said the territory must be granted more autonomy within India , while 35 percent said the Kashmiris must decide their own future and 14 percent said the issue ought to be handed over to the United Nations . Pakistan has long insisted that the Kashmir conflict can be solved by implementing decades - old U . N . resolutions calling for a plebiscite to allow Kashmiris to choose whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu - majority India . An overwhelming 76 percent of those polled said " No " to the proposition " India is bigger , therefore it should give more to Pakistan on issues . " There was also a clear verdict on whether this weekend ' s talks were a good sign ( 84 percent said " Yes " ) and whether both countries " should forget past bitterness and make a new beginning " ( 80 percent said " Yes " ) .

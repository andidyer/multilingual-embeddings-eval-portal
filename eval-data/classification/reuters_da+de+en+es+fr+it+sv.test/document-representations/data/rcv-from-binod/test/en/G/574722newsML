Tens of thousands in Hong Kong walk for charity . Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong donned sun - visors and shades on Sunday to take part in a marathon walk to raise money for charity , putting aside concerns about the territory ' s return to China in just 51 days . The 10 - km ( 6 . 25 - mile ) walk drew at least 80 , 000 people and was blessed with fair and sunny skies after a week of persistent rain had created havoc in some parts of the territory . Star attractions of the route included the Tsing Ma bridge , a two - tier suspension bridge opened by Britain ' s former premier Margaret Thatcher last month . Known to be the longest of its kind in the world , the rail - road bridge connects Hong Kong proper to the new Chek Lap Kok airport which is due to open in 1998 . Scores of first aid stations were set up along the route and over 800 policemen were deployed to keep order . The walk , opened around 9 a . m . ( 0100 GMT ) by Governor Chris Patten , collected over HK $ 20 million ( US $ 2 . 59 million ) for charity , the local ATV station quoted organisers as saying . Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 150 years , reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 .

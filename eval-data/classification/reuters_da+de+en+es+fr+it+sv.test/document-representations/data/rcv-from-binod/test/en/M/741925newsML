IMM currency futures end sluggish trade mixed . IMM currency futures ended a session of lethargic range - trading mixed as the market braced for the start Tuesday of Humphrey - Hawkins testimony . Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan gives the first day of the semi - annual testimony on economic conditions to Congress , and some futures brokers said the market was so quiet that they feared it was building pressure for a big swing one way or the other on any Greenspan utterance . " If they ' re not expecting anything , then there ' s usually a little paper flow , " said one leery IMM floor broker , " But today , there was no paper . " " That means we are going to get a surprise one way or the other . . . if everyone ' s got their guns in their pockets , " he added . " There ' s a lot of mixed reviews " about market direction . Most futures edged up slightly into the close , although market tone felt less - buoyant that it had early when brokers had predicted more downside for U . S . stocks . But the ability of the U . S . stock market to stabilize from early - Monday losses , especially on the heels of Friday ' s slide , sapped currency futures of potential upside and left them hanging . Some initial mark softness stemmed from expectations of an on - time but weak start to European Monetary Union ( EMU ) after France ' s audit of public sector finances estimated its 1997 public deficit at 3 . 5 to 3 . 7 percent of GDP . France then quickly announced measures to raise taxes and cut spending . At settlement , Sept yen lost $ 0 . 000031 to $ 0 . 008679 , marks eased $ 0 . 0009 to $ 0 . 5589 , Swiss francs rose $ 0 . 0007 to $ 0 . 6824 , sterling gained $ 0 . 0018 to $ 1 . 6754 , Canadian dollar lost $ 0 . 0013 to $ 0 . 7285 , Aussie dollar dipped $ 0 . 0002 to $ 0 . 7427 , Mexican peso rose $ 0 . 000225 to $ 0 . 123975 .

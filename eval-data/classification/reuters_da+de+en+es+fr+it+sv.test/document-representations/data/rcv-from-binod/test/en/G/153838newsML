Vienna stolen Jewish art sale exceeds hopes . A controversial auction of Austrian Jewish artwork looted by Nazi Germany raised a sum more than four times catalogue estimates to be distributed to Holocaust victims . The two - day sale of over 8 , 000 items at the Vienna Museum for Applied Arts , organised by British auctioneers Christie ' s , had fetched 153 million schillings ( $ 14 million ) by midday on Wednesday . The entire collection had been valued at just $ 3 . 5 million . " We didn ' t dare to hope for quite as much , " said Anke Adler - Slottke , director of the sale at Christie ' s . " One feels it is a very fitting tribute to a sale that has been difficult because of the provenance of the items , but the memory of those who are no longer with us was never far away , " she added . The highlight of the second day was a rediscovered ancient bust of Alexander the Great from 3 B . C . , valued at up to 800 , 000 schillings , which went for 2 . 9 million schillings . Bidding was less frenzied than on the first day but interest remained lively , Adler - Slottke said . Overall , Christie ' s had received over 2 , 000 commission bids and some 200 more by telephone on 18 lines from all over the world . " I would like to think the original owners would be proud to see how their taste has been appreciated in our age , " said Adler - Slottke . Miniatures , statues , Flemish tapestries , Albanian arms and a variety of old coins were among the items that went under the hammer on the auction ' s final day . Paul Grosz , President of Vienna ' s Jewish community , who described the collection as " a legacy of shame " , was cautious in his evaluation of the proceedings . " Naturally it ' s been a success , but the money isn ' t everything . We ' ll wait until the money ' s gone in before we begin to celebrate , " he said . Emotions had run high on Tuesday as bidders offered huge prices for works by often little - known artists . " I think prices paid occasionally for items certainly far ( exceeded ) what one would ( normally ) realise for the same artist , " Adler - Slottke said . A still life by 17th century French painter Abraham Mignon , valued at up to 800 , 000 schillings ( $ 75 , 000 ) , fetched the top price at 12 . 7 million schillings ( $ 1 . 20 million ) . It was bought by British art dealer Richard Green . The auction marked the last chapter in a long - running controversy over Austria ' s delay in returning the artworks to their owners after receiving them back from the Allies at the end of the war . Many of the works had been stored for the past 40 years in a monastery in Mauerbach , Austria . Austria finally returned the works to the Federation of Austrian Jewish Communities last year after a vote in parliament . Most of the original owners were killed in the Holocaust or fled the country . Some members of the Jewish community felt the money would be of little use to the few elderly survivors or their heirs remaining in Austria . " I think it would be better if the money from the murdered Jews went directly to Israel and helped people there , said Holocaust survivor Boris Familiant , who attended the auction .

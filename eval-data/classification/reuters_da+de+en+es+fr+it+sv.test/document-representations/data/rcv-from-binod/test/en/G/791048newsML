Presidential guard retakes Tajik aluminium town . Troops loyal to Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov seized a strategically important aluminium producing town , west of the capital Dushanbe , from a mutinous government commander on Monday . " Since the morning government forces have taken control of the three regions west of the Tajik capital , " Gaffar Mirzoyev , commander of Rakhmonov ' s presidential guard told reporters in Tursunzade , home to a large aluminium plant , 65 km ( 41 miles ) west of Dushanbe . One tank and several armoured vehicles belonging to the presidential guard were stationed near the factory . Workers at the aluminium factory said production had been unaffected . The plant has installed annual capacity of 500 , 000 tonnes , but it has been running at below half maximum capacity for years . Maverick government commander Makhmud Khudoyberdyev took Tursunzade and the surrounding area in January from a rival warlord and has held it ever since . On Saturday he moved forces towards Dushanbe from the south of the former Soviet republic to help warlord Yakub Salimov , who was driven out of the city on Sunday by rival warlord Ukhrob Kasimov , a Tajik interior ministry commander . The commander of an elite government armoured brigade , Khudoyberdyev seized upon unrest in Dushanbe to advance his own , as yet unclear , political ambitions . But the fall of the western towns of Shakhrynav and Tursunzade to the presidential guard allied with Kasimov ' s forces strengthened Rakhmonov ' s tenuous grip on power .

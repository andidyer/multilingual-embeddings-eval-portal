Search resumes in Colorado for missing plane . Rescue efforts resumed on Sunday for a missing A - 10 warplane suspected of having crashed in rugged mountainous terrain in Colorado after mysteriously disappearing during a routine training mission in Arizona , oficials said . Rescue efforts , which include two U - 2 spy planes , focused on five areas within a 420 - square - mile ( 675 - square - km ) swath near Vail , Colorado , in the central Rocky Mountains , but officials said they were not ready to send ground troops into the snowy area . " We ' re analysing a couple of specific areas , one north of the highway and one south of the highway , but we need a little more information before we ' re ready to both commit the resources or to put the people at risk in those high snow areas , " Lt . - Gen . Frank Campbell of Davis - Monthan Air Force Base told a news briefing in Eagle , Colorado , on Sunday . The A - 10 Thunderbolt , piloted by Capt . Craig Button , disappeared 11 days ago while on a routine training mission in Arizona . Air Force officials , who are investigating Button ' s background , have been unable to explain the mystery of why the 32 - year - old pilot departed from his three - aircraft formation and headed toward Colorado . Defence officials said the plane , carrying four 500 - pound ( 225 - kg ) conventional Mark 82 bombs , disappeared from the rear of a three - plane formation after leaving Davis - Monthan Air Force Base near Tuscon , Arizona . A week ago officials announced the search had been expanded to Colorado after radar tracking data indicated the plane may have flown to a location about 15 miles ( 25 km ) southwest of the Vail ski resort area .

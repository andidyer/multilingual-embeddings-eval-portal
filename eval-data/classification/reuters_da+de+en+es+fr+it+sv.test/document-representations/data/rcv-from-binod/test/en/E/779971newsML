Key U . S . economic gauge unchanged in June . A key gauge of future economic activity was flat in June , the Conference Board reported on Tuesday , as five out of 10 separate measures of the economy ' s pace weakened from May . The Index of Leading Indicators was unchanged after rising 0 . 3 percent in May and falling 0 . 1 percent in April . The index climbed steadily in each month through the first quarter of this year before starting to level off in the second quarter . The flat June performance was weaker than Wall Street economists ' expectations of a small 0 . 1 percent increase in the monthly index . The Conference Board , a privately financed business research group , said the strongest negative influences in June came from higher initial claims for state unemployment pay and and a shorter average factory workweek . In addition , interest - rate spreads broadened , new applications for building permits were fewer and delivery times sped up for finished goods - - a sign that factories were not as busy as in May . The positive influences on the June index came primarily from a soaring stock market and from a stronger money supply . In addition , orders were up for consumer and capital goods and consumer expectations were stronger in June . The tapering off in economic activity suggested by the index was consistent with last week ' s Commerce Department report showing that gross domestic product , or GDP , slowed to a 2 . 2 percent rate of advance in the second quarter from 4 . 9 percent in the first quarter . Growth in total national output , as measured by GDP , is expected to continue at around a 2 . 5 percent to 3 percent annual pace in the second half .

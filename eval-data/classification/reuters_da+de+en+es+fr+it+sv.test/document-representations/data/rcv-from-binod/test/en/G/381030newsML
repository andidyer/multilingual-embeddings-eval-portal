CYCLING - RUTA DEL SOL OPEN AS FALL HOLDS UP FAVOURITES . The Ruta del Sol was thrown wide open on Sunday when the favourites were held up by a multi - rider pile - up at the end of the first stage , which was won by German sprinter Erik Zabel . Toni Rominger and Armand de las Cuevas were left 47 seconds back , with Tour of Spain winner Alex Zuelle nearly two minutes adrift . Another crash , caused when Belgian Tom Steels lost control with the finish line in sight , enabled Zabel to almost cruise to victory . Before the crashes the riders had covered most of the 119 kilometres over a city circuit around Seville at a tremendous pace . The only breakaway that looked likely to succeed was made by Francisco Cerezo and Gines Salmeron , who built up a lead of over a minute after moving clear of the pack on the 10th of the 15 laps . The pair were hauled in on the final lap , but just two kilometres from the finish a mistake by a rider on a straight section brought down a group of 30 and barred the way to a similar number of others . Steels had looked likely to overtake Zabel in the final straight but went down less than 100 metres from the line . His fall brought down four other riders , leaving Zabel to ride out a relatively comfortable winner . Television replays suggested that Steels , who was able to finish despite initially appearing badly injured , lost his balance after his right foot came loose from the pedal . The race continues on Monday with a 160 km stage between La Rinconada and Puente Genil .

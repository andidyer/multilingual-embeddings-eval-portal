INTERVIEW - Ultramar CEO still on buying prowl . Ultramar Diamond Shamrock , itself the result of a 1996 merger , is still on the prowl to boost its position in the fiercely competitive U . S . refining industry , the company ' s chief executive said . " We would like to participate in further consolidation in the industry , Roger Hemminghaus , Ultramar Diamond ' s top executive told Reuters in an interview . " I don ' t know if that means finding more retail outlets or refining assets . " He did not elaborate and would not comment on talk his company may want Total SA U . S . refining assets . Ultramar would likely look to expand in the Northeast , the Southwest and possibly even Mexico . He added it was fair to say that , given the challenges in oil refining , including poor margins and overcapacity , all the players in the industry are too interested in the prospect of an alliance to dismiss any overture out of hand . Still finding the right fit strategically or culturally is not an easy thing and he stressed caution in this regard . " You ' ve got to turn over a lot of stones , kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince , before you find the right deal , " he said . He said the 1996 merger that created the company has been going smoothly , with the company ahead of pace on its projected savings . " We really haven ' t had any surprises , " Hemminghaus said . " We said the first year were going to save $ 25 million . It ' s looking like it ' s going to be $ 32 million . " He added that the rest of the projected $ 75 million in savings on insurance , finance and refining costs are likely to be realized next year . The trend toward consolidation was sure to continue in the coming years and the bigger players were sure to improve their chances of survival . While reluctant to pinpoint how much refining capacity an independent refiner needed to have to enhance chances of success , he did say smaller plants , particularly on fiercely competitive U . S . Gulf Coast , were at a disadvantage . " If you ' re competing on the Gulf Coast , you need at least 100 , 000 barrels per day ( of throughput capacity ) , " he said , adding that , in general , economies of scale were much easier to realize beyond the 75 , 000 barrels per day threshold . Ultramar Diamond now has four refineries with 500 , 000 bpd crude processing capacity and 4 , 400 retail outlets mainly in the U . S . Southwest , Rocky Mountain and eastern Canada regions . That ' s about half of Tosco Corp , a Connecticut - based refiner and marketer with operations on both the East and West coasts that is widely regarded as the industry leader . Asked if his company may be vulnerable to what some analysts see as the coming rationalization in the retailing sector of the oil business , Hemminghaus did not appear too concerned , saying the retail outlets that would face shutdown were likely to be older with financially onerous environmental problems hanging over future viability . Regarding expansion of retail outlets , Hemminghaus said the near - term focus was likely to be in the U . S . Northeast , where the company is home heating oil retailer and to a lesser extent in Mexico , where Ultramar Diamond has 12 convenience stores , although no branded gasoline stations . " Our strategy is to have quality assets that are relatively new and then to have a strong retail presence , " Hemminghaus said . - - Oliver Ludwig , New York Energy Desk 1 212 859 1620

HK ' s Tung sets out limits to peaceful protest . Hong Kong ' s future chief executive , Tung Chee - hwa , bluntly told pro - democracy activists on Sunday their freedom to protest would be limited once the British colony reverts to China at midnight on Monday . Tung told BBC television ' s Breakfast with Frost programme that peaceful protests were part of Hong Kong ' s culture and would be permitted . But he said there would be exceptions . " Where there will be problems is in areas such as . . . advocating the independence of Taiwan and Tibet . " And there , there will be problems . The feelings of Chinese people on these issues are quite straightforward , and this has to be taken into account also , " Tung said . He said he would have no objection to his own effigy being burned in protest but was less forthcoming when asked how the authorities would react if Chinese leaders were given the same treatment . " It would depend under what circumstances this is being done . " he said . Under laws prepared by the new Beijing - appointed legislature and due to come into force at midnight on Monday , police approval will be required to stage protests . " Slanderous or derogatory remarks are not helpful , firstly , and , secondly , they are not part of our culture . And I would certainly hope that we ' ll look at it on that sort of basis , " he said . Tung said he had been in constructive discussions with Hong Kong ' s Democratic Party to find a way to permit them to express their views in a " dignified " way after the handover that would be " good for the community as a whole " . He said : " The effort is continuing . One thing I want to assure you is that anybody who wants to achieve martyrdom on June 30 will be very disappointed . " British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the same programme that the absence of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng from a farewell banquet on Monday evening was not a snub . " The fact of the matter is we never expected them to be at the farewell ( banquet ) ceremony . . . In the plans for those two gentlemen , nothing has changed , " he said . He said Jiang and Li would attend the formal handover ceremony with Prince Charles , heir to the British throne , while Foreign Minister Qian Qichen would be at the banquet . " That ' s quite normal . I ' m afraid I ' ve become accustomed as foreign secretary to the fact that is is the function of foreign secretaries to eat for the nation , and that ' s what Qian Qichen will be doing , " Cook quipped . He said he hoped to establish a good working relationship with China , which is regaining control of Hong Kong after 156 years of colonial rule . Britain had an immense economic stake in Hong Kong as well as a clear responsibility to its six million people . " If it goes well , Hong Kong can be a bridge not a barrier between us and China , but going well means the terms of the Joint Declaration must be fulfilled by China , " Cook said . Tung also stressed the importance of warm Sino - British ties . " I hope with the new British government there will be a genuine effort to improve the British - Chinese relationship , and that would help Hong Kong a great deal , " he said . Former prime minister Margaret Thatcher , who signed the 1984 Joint declaration paving the way for the handover , said she was a " cautious optimist " about Hong Kong ' s future . She condemned Beijing ' s plans to replace Hong Kong ' s elected legislative council with an unelected legislature . " This must be the first time as the pages of history turn going from dependence on Britain to dependence on another country has meant cutting democracy , " Thatcher said . But she added : " Let ' s give the new administration a chance . Let ' s give the people a chance to show they are reasonable . "

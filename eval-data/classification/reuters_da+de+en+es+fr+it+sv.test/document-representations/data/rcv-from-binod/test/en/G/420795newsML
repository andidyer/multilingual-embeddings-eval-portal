Yeltsin faces big test in state of nation speech . Boris Yeltsin put the finishing touches on Wednesday to an annual state of the nation speech , the most important policy statement of his new term as Russian president and a test of his strength after illness . The 66 - year - old president cleared his day ' s diary to work on Thursday ' s speech to parliament , to be followed by a cabinet reshuffle which looks likely to make Kremlin aide and liberal reformer Anatoly Chubais number two in the government . Yeltsin is expected to address a joint assembly of the two chambers of parliament for 30 to 40 minutes . It will be his longest public appearance in the eight months since he was re - elected , most of which has been spent fighting ill health . " It will test his strength and ability to rule , " said Andrei Piontkowski , head of the independent Centre for Strategic Studies . " He has been getting more and more confident and it looks like everything is okay now . " Yeltsin has looked increasinlgy well as he gradually stepped up his visits to the Kremlin in recent weeks following the pneumonia in January which stalled his political comeback . Thursday ' s speech in the Kremlin ' s Marble Hall , the former home of Communist Party meetings , will be a summary of a long written document called a poslaniye ( message ) which will set out policy for the year ahead and will be handed out to legislators . Yeltsin has made clear he will not change the course of economic reforms , but plans to tighten discipline in some areas and shift the emphasis in others . Kremlin sources said the speech would call for the government to improve efforts to tackle economic problems such as ensuring wages and pensions are paid on time . Yeltsin is expected to rule out amendments to the constitution demanded by political opponents to weaken his vast powers or force him out for health reasons . He will also demand tougher action against crime and particularly economic crime , the Kremlin sources said . Yeltsin is also widely expected to demand stricter bankruptcy laws , implementation of a new tax code which is in the works , adoption of international accounting standards and regulations against state monopolies . The president ' s aim is to continue the gradual process of proving he is in charge and that he is ready to get tough to tackle the many economic and political problems facing the disillusioned population of nearly 150 million . He could unleash more criticism of his ministers , particularly over the government ' s budget , to shift the blame for the wage delays which have prompted trade unions to make March 27 a day of nationwide protests . The planned cabinet reshuffle , demanded by Yeltsin over the government ' s failure to pay wages on time , is also part of the president ' s campaign to reassert his authority . The government meets on Thursday afternoon but it is not clear when the cabinet changes will be announced . The Kremlin sources said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would stay on but the 41 - year - old Chubais , who has been in charge of the presidential administration since July , was likely to take over responsibility for the economy . That would please foreign investors , who applaud Chubais ' liberal reform policies , but would anger communist and nationalist leaders who detest him for his role in overseeing privatisation during an earlier spell in the government . Chubais , who masterminded Yeltsin ' s election campaign , looks set to become the only first deputy prime minister , meaning three ministers who have that rank now face demotion . Finance Minister Alexander Livshits , who was criticised by Chernomyrdin on Wednesday , looks particulalry vulnerable . But first deputy prime minister Viktor Ilyushin , Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and all ministers dealing with the economy or social policy have cause for concern .

DUTCH NCM ALTERS INSURANCE POLICY RISK PROFILE . Dutch credit insurer NCM NV said on Tuesday it was changing its insurance policy on export credits of capital goods and international construction works . The company said it was altering its policy by setting a risk - limit per country instead of setting overall transaction limits for those insurance risks . NCM said the new policy would set fewer limits for big insurance transactions , while the portfolio remained sound . " An insurance limit per country is not a statistical figure , " NCM said , adding that it would also take into account the character , weight and size of each risk . NCM is the holding company for a number of operating companies forming the NCM Groep , among which are Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij NV ( NCM - NL ) , NCM Credit Insurance Ltd ( NCM - UK ) and NCM International ( NCM - INT ) . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 fax + 31 20 504 5040

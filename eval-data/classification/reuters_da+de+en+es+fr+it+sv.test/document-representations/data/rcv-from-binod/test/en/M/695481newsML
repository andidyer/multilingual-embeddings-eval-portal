ZIMBABWE DOLLAR STARTS NEW WEEK MIXED ON UNITS . The Zimbabwe dollar was quoted mixed against hard currencies on Monday with dealers expecting it to stabilise on the key U . S . dollar after last week ' s steep fall . The local currency lost seven cents on the U . S . dollar last week on the back of import pressure which overwhelmed the export resources available , prompting the central Reserve Bank to intervene on Friday to smoothen the decline . " We ' ve seen a big movement over a short space of time and I think now the dollar should stabilise or even appreciate a little , " one dealer said on Monday . However at around 0810 GMT , the local currency was trading softer on the U . S . unit at 11 . 3950 / 4050 compared to Friday ' s 11 . 3825 / 3925 but was little changed at 18 . 9400 / 9600 from 18 . 9400 / 9685 versus sterling . It firmed to 6 . 5400 / 5600 from 6 . 5650 / 5725 against the mark and to 2 . 5100 / 5175 on the rand from 2 . 5195 / 5235 . - - Stella Mapenzauswa , Harare Newsroom : + 263 - 4 72 52 27 / 8 / 9 - -

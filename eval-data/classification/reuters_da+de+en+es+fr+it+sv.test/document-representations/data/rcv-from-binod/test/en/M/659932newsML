Bond - loving Danes show rising interest in shares . Danish institutional investors who traditionally put their money into bonds are increasingly opting for the stock market in the search for better long - term returns . " Our shareholdings have more than doubled in the past 10 years to around 30 percent of total investments , " said Rolf Norstrand , securities director at ATP , Denmark ' s biggest institutional investor with around 165 billion crowns ( $ 25 billion ) in funds . " Danish investors were mainly bond - focused until about a decade ago . Today Danes are much more aware of the attractions of shares , which now seem a safer investment , attracting more and more private clients , and there are tax benefits , " he said . Not only has there been a shift from bonds to shares but also a move from purely domestic investment to a more international portfolio , he told Reuters . " We did not have a foreign share portfolio at all until the early 1990s . Today three - quarters of ATP ' s entire shareholding is Danish stock , the remaininq quarter foreign , mainly from western Europe , " he added . Danish legislation limits to 35 percent of total investment capital , the amount that the two biggest institutional investors ATP and LD may allocate to shares , limiting diversification . The law allows all other institutional investors to put up to 40 percent of investment capital in stocks . Analysts said there was no political majority for change at present with a Social Democrat - led government in power . " We want to see the limit raised to 40 percent so that ATP can buy more shares but that would require changes in the law , " Norstrand said . LD now has about 34 percent of its available funds in shares after increasing them from 25 percent in 1994 . Thirty percent of funds are in Danish paper and four percent in foreign stock . The remainder of its capital is in bonds . " We began to build up our foreign share portfolio gradually in 1990 , before that date LD owned no foreign shares , " LD investment director Jeppe Christiansen told Reuters . " Our focus has been increasingly on shares in recent years and our strategy has been to buy as many as possible , " he said . At end - 1996 LD held Danish shares at a total nominal value of 11 billion crowns and foreign stock at around two billion crowns with total investment funds of some 45 billion crowns . KP another big Danish institutional investor , said it last year increased its holdings in foreign stock by 10 percent to 36 percent of total share investment funds . KP , which has so far focused on Far East stock , said it would diversify this year into South America and eastern Europe . While the Copenhagen bond market is Europe ' s fifth biggest with 6 , 661 billion crown turnover last year , the share market had 1996 turnover of a relatively modest 217 billion crowns . Latest statistics show that share trading on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange increased 18 percent in market value year - on - year in May , while nominal bond turnover fell almost four percent . " The rise in trading volume cannot be attributed so much to Danish domestic institutional investors ' increased interest , " Christiansen said . " It is is mainly because of an influx of foreign buyers . " . A Copenhagen Stock Exchange spokeswoman put the share trading rise down to the strong dollar , the good performance of Danish companies and their solid earnings potential .

Croatian stocks mixed , mild rise seen next week . Croatian stocks closed the week mixed on Friday in somewhat slower trade marked by new gains among hoteliers and poor performance of the leading issues . " I think we can expect another week of mild growth , " said Davor Relja , analyst at Faktor brokerage . Six of 14 active issues rose on Friday , three were flat and five fell . Volume was almost halved from Thursday at 9 , 249 units with turnover at 3 . 6 million kuna . " The situation largely depends on foreign investors , " Relja said , adding that leading issues like fully - listed Zagrebacka Banka would be crucial . " If Zagrebacka firms , trade could be livelier than this week , otherwise not , " Relja said , noting that it has been stagnating for quite a while . The bank ' s ordinary share lost 35 kuna to 2 , 000 , with only 100 shares changing hands . Another market heavyweight , drugs concern Pliva , did not trade . On Thursday it added six kuna to 501 and Relja said the stock was undergoing a short - term stagnation but its price was not likely to fall much under 500 kuna . Fully - listed Varazdinska Banka suffered new losses . Its A - series lost seven kuna to 203 and B - series inched down 10 kuna to 175 , on volumes of 390 and 35 units , respectively . Brewery Karlovacka Pivovara was the hot stock of the day . The brewery , in which Chile ' s Cervecerias Unidas has a majority stake , added 15 kuna to 420 , with 1 , 124 shares sold . " The stock became interesting . It had a favourable annual report , doubled its profit and now pays a good dividend . New investments by its majority owner are expected , " said Relja . Unlike the blue chips , hoteliers traded well . Three of four active stocks rose and one was flat . Istraturist was Friday ' s biggest gainer , adding 10 kuna or 5 . 6 percent to 190 , on volume of 836 shares . Jadranturist inched up five kuna to 275 with 836 units sold . Only Laguna Porec traded flat at 1 , 480 , selling 367 shares . Biggest decliner cable maker Elka lost 12 kuna or 7 . 1 percent to 145 , with 77 units sold . Food concern Podravka was the most active stock with 3 , 877 shares sold . It edged down eight kuna to 275 . Traders could not see significant changes of its stock price before the firm releases its 1996 results and half - year 1997 results . " I don ' t believe it could fall drastically . . . unless the whole market is hit by summer depression , " Relja said .

Compaq seen unveiling speedy NT workstations . Compaq Computer Corp . will unveil powerful new Intel - based computer workstations Monday just seven months after its aggressive entry into the fiercely competitive area , industry sources said . A Compaq representative said the company scheduled a press briefing in San Francisco , the backyard of the world ' s leading sellers of engineering workstations , Sun Microsystems Inc . and Hewlett - Packard Co . , to unveil the new workstations . Compaq said Friday it will introduce new workstations , but declined to provide further details . Computer industry analysts and executives said the workstations are expected to provide the sort of " hot box " appeal that has traditionally generated a buzz among the engineering community , which has long been the target market for such high - powered desktop systems . A key difference is that unlike classic workstations , which during the 1980s unseated more costly minicomputer systems by offering raw power using custom processors and versions of the Unix operating system , Compaq ' s machines are based on Intel Corp . microprocessors running Microsoft Corp . ' s Windows NT system . Industry sources familiar with Compaq ' s product pipeline said the systems are a major advance as the company charges into workstation market , valued at $ 13 billion to $ 15 billion a year in total revenues . One of these sources said Compaq will offer models based on Intel ' s new Pentium II processor , introduced just last month , with entry pricing around $ 6 , 000 for a one - processor system , with a much lower cost of adding more processors than for more specialized , proprietary chips . Higher - end Intel Pentium Pro workstations are expected to start at prices around $ 14 , 000 , with number crunching four - processor systems available for less than $ 20 , 000 - - a sharply lower price point than equivalent Unix systems . In a major improvement , it addresses past limitations on the speed at which data travels within the machines by providing dual memory control and PCI buses - - offering speedier communications between internal components . Analysts would not discuss details of the expected announcement , but said Compaq is working to eliminate one of the most compelling past advantages of the Unix market by addressing architectural constraints of Intel machines . " You can no longer say the Intel workstation ' s a PC , " said DataPro analyst Peter Lowber . " That ' s impressive . " Compaq ' s fierce drive into the workstation market has already shown up in Windows NT market share numbers . Dataquest analyst Peter ffoulkes said Compaq is already ranked No . 2 in both value and volume terms in NT workstation at the end of the second quarter - - after only six months in the business . High end graphics - oriented Intergraph leads in revenue terms , but Compaq is firmly No . 2 in both units shipped and sales , according to Dataquest first - quarter 1997 data . In Britain , Compaq also claimed first place market position in the first quarter , boosted by an order for 5 , 700 workstations from bankers BZW . The Compaq machines are further evidence of the rapid erosion of the traditional Unix workstation market as machines based on lower - cost , high volume Intel chips and Windows NT start invading the space . Dataquest estimates that Windows NT workstations made up 23 . 6 percent of total workstation unit shipments in the first quarter , and 12 . 4 percent of market revenue . Nevertheless , the market for Intel - based workstations also requires that companies marketing workstation applications make them available on Windows NT machines - - a process that has begun but which takes time . Compaq ' s announcement will go a long way to overcome a few early growing pains in the workstation arena . For example , a high - flying HP executive it hired last September to run the new Compaq workstation business defected after only a matter of weeks to Sun Microsystems .

KC Fed ' s Hakkio sees US growth of 2 - 2 . 5 pct in 97 . The U . S . economy is poised for slower growth in 1997 compared to last year , and will expand at a rate of 2 to 2 - 1 / 2 percent , the new head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City predicted . The slowing would bring growth close to the economy ' s long - run potential rate , Craig Hakkio , director of research at the Kansas City Fed , said in an interview with Reuters . " I would describe the outlook as growing at or slightly above trend , " Hakkio said , adding that the 3 . 4 percent pace recorded in 1996 on a fourth quarter over fourth quarter basis was " definitely above trend . " The economy finished last year on a particularly strong note , advancing by 4 . 7 percent . Hakkio said a return to a " more normal " trade picture after a boom in exports late last year as well as a deceleration across various sectors would contribute to the slowdown . He expressed uncertainty , however , about the extent to which a slowing would relieve inflationary pressures in the economy and , in fact , predicted a slight rise in underlying inflation this year . " There is a both a level and a growth - rate effect , " Hakkio said . " If you start a little bit above trend and then you grow at potential , then you ' re going to be the same distance from potential . So part of it depends on whether we ' re at potential . " Hakkio said the answer was unclear with the U . S . unemployment rate by many estimates below its so - called " natural " rate but capacity utilization closer to a normal level . Still , he said , " With the resource pressures I would expect inflation to increase on the whole in the coming year . " Looking at the labor market , Hakkio said there were clearly upward pressures on wages as evidenced by a pickup in the employment cost index and average hourly earnings . However , given uncertainty over how much of the increase may be offset by productivity gains , Hakkio said , " It ' s hard to judge whether those increases in wages are inflationary or whether they are not inflationary . " Hakkio , who replaced now - retired Kansas City Fed Research Director Thomas Davis at the start of this year , attended his first meeting of the policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee earlier this month . In addition to advising Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig on monetary policy , Hakkio oversees a research staff at the bank of about 100 . Hakkio , who studied international macroeconomics at the University of Chicago and later taught at Northwestern , has been with the Kansas City Fed for 12 years . He described his approach to monetary policy as eclectic , in keeping with the strategy the Fed has used since it moved away from monetary targetting . " The monetary aggregates have been difficult to interpret , so we ' ve had to look at a lot of indicators and think about how to measure the stance of monetary policy , " Hakkio said .

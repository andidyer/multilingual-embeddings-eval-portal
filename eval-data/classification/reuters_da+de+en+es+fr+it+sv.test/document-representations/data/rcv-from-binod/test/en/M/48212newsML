Safwan al - Bataina , general manager of the Palestine Securities Exchange ( PSE ) , said technical and administrative preparations for the $ 2 million exchange had been completed . " We now have an advanced securities exchange both in terms of its electronic equipment and in terms of the strict monitoring regulations . We are waiting for the Palestinian Authority to . . . issue the necessary legal regulations to start working , " Bataina told Reuters . " The ball now is in the Authority ' s court , " he said . Bataina said he was due to meet Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammad Zuhdi Nashashibi later on Thursday to discuss the subject . The ministry acts as the regulatory authority supervising the PSE . Nashashibi was not immediately available to comment . The PSE is a joint venture between the Palestinian Development and Investment Company ( PADICO ) and the PLO ' s Samed Establishment , two main players in the nascent Palestinian economy . Both began working on setting up the exchange in the West Bank city of Nablus last year .

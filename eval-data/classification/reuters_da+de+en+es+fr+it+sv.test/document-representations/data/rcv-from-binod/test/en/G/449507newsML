UK Labour plays down prospect of landslide win . Senior opposition Labour party official Peter Mandelson warned on Tuesday against expectations of a landslide Labour victory in the May 1 British election . Speaking to media representatatives in London , Mandelson was sceptical about the strong lead Labour has in opinion polls . " Are we 28 points ahead . . . are we going to win by a landslide ? I doubt it , " he said . Mandelson , a legislator who is in charge of Labour ' s election planning , stressed the changes in the Labour party under its leader Tony Blair would remain in place if and when the party took power . The changes that had been made in New Labour were irreversible , Mandelson said of the party that has dumped much of its traditional left - wing dogma since Blair took over the leadership in 1994 . " One thing is sure . Whatever the result , whatever the size of the majority , what you see before the election is what you will get after . . . if we are elected , " he said . Mandelson believed the Labour Party would sign up " quite quickly " to the European Social Chapter if elected . However , he doubted that taking that step would make a significant difference to Britain . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 524 7717

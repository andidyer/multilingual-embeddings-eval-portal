French cancer swindle seen widening . The French newspaper Le Monde said on Thursday officials at the country ' s leading cancer - fighting association had swindled donors of hundreds of millions of francs ( tens of millions of dollars ) through a system of fund transfers and false invoices . The newspaper , quoting a police report , said the scope of the swindle at the Association for Cancer Research ( ARC ) was far bigger than first believed and much of the money appeared to have ended up in the pockets of the group ' s former leader and his associates . ARC officials were not immediately available for comment on the newspaper report . The scandal broke out early this year when the national audit office slammed ARC , which is funded by private donations , for spending little more that a quarter its budget on research . Donations to charities tumbled amid a public outcry . The head of ARC , Jacques Crozemarie , was forced to resign and jailed pending trial . A judge is formally probing eight other people on suspicion of swindle , forgery and misuse of corporate funds . Le Monde said ARC , funded by donations from individuals , paid more than a billion francs ( $ 200 million ) in 1990 - 95 without tenders to contractor , promotors and companies which made exorbitant profits through falsified or fictitious invoicing . The association ' s new leaders estimated that a large part of this amount was wrongfully paid and they told Le Monde they were still trying to find out where the money went . The police report said Crozemarie , said to have run ARC as a fiefdom without any control , had received several million francs in fees from ARC contractors and other unexplained payments . It suggested that a businessman who chaired several of ARC ' s contractor companies and who has been placed under investigation had been paid nearly 35 million francs ( $ seven million ) in 1989 - 96 . Another , who since died , had received 10 million francs ( $ 2 million ) , not including paradise holidays in Polynesia , the Indian Ocean and the Balearic islands and extravagant gifts of expensive wine and champagne , said the report . ARC had so far been reported to have funded political parties to left and right by paying for fund - raising advertisements in municipal newsletters and brochures . The use of front companies to collect illicit campaign funds in exchange for alleged consultancy or advertising services has been a feature of French political life for decades .

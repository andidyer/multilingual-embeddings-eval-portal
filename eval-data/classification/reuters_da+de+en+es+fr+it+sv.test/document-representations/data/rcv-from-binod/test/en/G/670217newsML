China won ' t gobble up Taiwan - Qian . China has pledged not to " gobble up " Taiwan and said the thorny issue need not sour Sino - US relations . The assurance came from Foreign Minister Qian Qichen , who said in an interview published on Wednesday that the " one country , two systems " formula adopted for the Hong Kong handover on June 30 was originally initiated for Taiwan . On Tuesday , China expressed serious concern and dissatisfaction to Washington over a visit to the United States by Taiwan ' s Foreign Minister John Chang , a grandson of Chiang Kai - Shek . Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the Communists won the Chinese civil war and sent Chiang Kai - Shek ' s Nationalist troops fleeing into exile on the island in 1949 . Qian , interviewed in Beijing by Hong Kong ' s South China Morning Post , said : " The question posed was whether we should achieve reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait under the socialism we pursued here and gobble up Taiwan or under the so - called democracy and freedom of Taiwan and so gobble up the mainland . " " We believe neither is a desirable choice , " the foreign minister added in an interview published less than two weeks before Hong Kong reverts to China after 156 years of British colonial rule . " We believe that this method is not right because it is not a matter of me swallowing you or you swallowing me , " Qian added . Taiwan rejects the Hong Kong formula and says it is committed to reunification , but under democracy and a free market . China has threatened to invade if Taiwan declares independence . Taiwan is a sensitive issue in Sino - American relations in the lead - up to the Hong Kong handover , where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has decided not to attend the swearing in of a provisional legislature hand - picked by Beijing . The provisional body will replace an assembly elected in 1995 . Qian insisted in the interview that Taiwan need not cause a crisis in bilateral relations . " The principles for handling it have already been laid down in the Sino - U . S . joint communiques , " he told the newspaper . " As long as the spirit enshrined in them is abided by , this problem , even if it is not resolved in the end , will not necessarily provide an obstacle for Sino - U . S . relations . " He warned that Taiwan " will create big trouble " if it opts for independence , and said " the problems would be more serious " if the United States supported such a move . " The U . S . should not support independence nor practise ' one China , one Taiwan ' or two Chinas - - nor support Taiwan ' s return to the United Nations , " Qian said . He said U . S . Congressmen concerned about the handover of Hong Kong lacked detailed knowledge about the territory . " When I was in the U . S . , I met many Congressmen and realised they didn ' t know much about Hong Kong . " They felt now that Hong Kong ' s return to Chinese sovereignty was a major story , but when Beijing and London signed the Joint Declaration ( clinching the handover deal ) in 1984 , they had not paid attention to it .

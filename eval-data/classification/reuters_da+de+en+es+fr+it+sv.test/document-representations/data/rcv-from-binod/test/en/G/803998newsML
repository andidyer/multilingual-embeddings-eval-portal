GOLF - HEAT ENGULFS THIRD ROUND OF PGA CHAMPIONSHIP . The PGA Championship really heated up on Saturday as soaring temperatures and oppressive humidity descended on Winged Foot Golf Club for the third round of the year ' s last major championship . By the time the final pairing of the day - - second - round leader Lee Janzen and Davis Love , trailing by a stroke - - teed off in the early afternoon the temperature hit 90 degrees ( 32 . 22C ) and the humidity made even standing in the shade almost unbearable . Both parred the first hole - - which had ranked as the most difficult in the first two rounds - - although Love had to sink a testy six - footer for his par . British Open champion Justin Leonard , who birdied the third hole , and Shiegeki Maruyama of Japan , who birdied the first , both joined Love at three under par , one behind Janzen . The weather alone was difficult to deal with , but it also would make famed Winged Foot ' s 6 , 987 - yard , par - 70 West Course play much harder , especially for the late players , as the searing heat dried out the greens and fairways , which had been softened by rain the day before the championship began . The early starters had the best playing conditons and several took advantage . Colin Montgomerie of Britain , Frank Nobilo of New Zealand and American Scott McCarron all shot 67 - - one off the course record - - in the morning . It was the first time that each had broken par in the championship . They were all at two - over - par 212 - - one better than Tim Herron ( 68 ) and two better than Australians Steve Elkington ( 70 ) and Stuart Appleby ( 69 ) among the early sweat - soaked finishers . Elkington won this championship in 1995 in a playoff with Montgomerie . Tiger Woods , who opened the tournament with a pair of even - par 70s , continued to draw big galleries among the 25 , 000 spectators - - who appreciated the shade of Winged Foot ' s tree - lined fairways . The 21 - year - old Masters champion , who started the day four shots behind , parred the first three holes as he tried to stay within striking distance of the leaders . But then disaster struck . Woods drove into the ankle - deep rough on the 460 - yard fourth hole and barely touched the ball on his second , advancing it only about 10 yards . He missed the green with his third and settled for a six . Among the players who struggled in the morning was U . S . Open champion Ernie Els of South Africa , who carded a 74 that left him 10 strokes over par at 220 . Els - - who also won the 1994 U . S . Open in very similar heat at Oakmont - - had been expected to contend here . He likes tough courses like Winged Foot and won last year ' s Westchester Classic only a few miles away . But he failed to break par in three trips around Winged Foot .

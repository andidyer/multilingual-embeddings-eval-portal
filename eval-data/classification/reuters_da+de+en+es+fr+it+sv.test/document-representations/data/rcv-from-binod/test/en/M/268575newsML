RTRS - Australia dlr reluctant to step outside range . The Australian dollar spent most of the day snaking around the US $ 0 . 7910 support level before a late rise saw it finish an uneventful day around the middle of the US $ 0 . 7910 / 50 range it has spent most of the past week in . Traders said the local market had been thin , and with no local news and little internationally until the German Bundesbank meeting and U . S . trade data later today , foreign exchange in the region had been fairly quiet . By 4 . 30 p . m . ( 0530 GMT ) the dollar was at US $ 0 . 7925 / 30 , its highs for the day and up on an early US $ 0 . 7912 / 17 , and also exactly in line with its local close on Wednesday . On the day , traders said volumes were light , and the unit was held to a US $ 0 . 7907 / 25 range . There had been some Aussie / yen buying , especially when the cross dipped in line with the U . S . dollar in morning trade . " It ' s been very quiet , although there seems to be a little bit of Aussie / yen going through . " one trader said of the day . There had been some early talk amongst the bearish in the market that a test below US $ 0 . 7900 may have occurred today following the rebuffal the dollar received at US $ 0 . 7970 on Wednesday , but the unwinding failed to occur . Traders said there was technical related demand as the unit approached its 200 - day moving average of US $ 0 . 7906 , and talk of large buy orders placed at around US $ 0 . 7900 that was providing a floor for the dollar . At the same time , following the dollar ' s rejection above US $ 0 . 7950 on Wednesday , sellers were expected to emerge on any rally towards US $ 0 . 7950 , traders said . On the crosses the unit finished at 89 . 99 / 90 . 09 yen , a touch up on its opening 89 . 93 / 90 . 03 and essentially level with its previous close of 90 . 02 / 12 . The dollar also posted some gains against the New Zealand dollar , which traded lower on Wednesday ahead of a late afternoon press conference by the head of the New Zealand First party , and Treasurer in the centre right coalition government , Winston Peters . Peters , who has expressed concern at the Kiwi ' s appreciation to over US $ 0 . 7000 , said the high level of the dollar was still a concern to exporters . Over the day , the Australian dollar improved to NZ $ 1 . 1205 / 23 from an early NZ $ 1 . 1177 / 95 . In trade weighted terms the dollar closed at 58 . 7 , steady with its open but down on the 58 . 9 close on Wednesday . With no major local data due until balance of payments data on Janaury 6 , traders said the market had wound down for the Christmas break , and would basically follow the U . S . dollar into the New Year . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 1800

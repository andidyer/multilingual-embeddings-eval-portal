TV names freed hostage as Japanese diplomat . Marxist rebels released a sick - looking captive from the besieged Japanese embassy residence in Lima on Christmas Day and local television named the man as Japanese diplomat Kenji Hirata . Hirata , who was pushed out of the residence in a wheelchair by Red Cross workers , was a first secretary at the Japanese embassy in Peru , the television said . After being pushed out of the residence gates into the sealed - off street , the Red Cross helpers loaded Hirata into a police ambulance which sped him away . Radio reports said he was being taken to a police hospital . There was no immediate explanation as to why the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) hostage - takers had released the diplomat but local media speculated that his health reasons were the cause . Hirata left the residence with Catholic bishop Jose Luis Cipriani , who had earlier spent seven hours inside the residence celebrating mass with the captives and hearing their confessions . Cipriani did not speak to waiting reporters . Following the release , 104 captives remained inside the residence under the gun of the MRTA guerrillas .

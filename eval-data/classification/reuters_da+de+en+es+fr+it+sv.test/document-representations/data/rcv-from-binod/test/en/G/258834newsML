Indiana ' s Sen . Coats to retire in 1998 . Republican Sen . Dan Coats of Indiana said Monday he would not run for re - election when his term ends in 1998 , opening the way for Democrat Evan Bayh to reclaim the seat once held by his father . " I want to leave when I am young enough to contribute somewhere else - - young enough to resume a career outside government , " Coats , 53 , said in a statement . He has served in the Senate since 1989 , when he was appointed to replace Dan Quayle after Quayle became vice president . Coats , a believer in congressional term limits , served eight years in the House before joining the Senate , where he is one of its most conservative members . He said he would spend the next two years speaking out about his concerns for the country ' s future . " I will continue to challenge my own party on its responsibilities to the poor , to speak strongly for the value and dignity of human life , to be an advocate for children and families , " he said . Coats ushered through a series of bills under the umbrella of the American Family Act that called for private charitable support for poor families to replace government welfare programmes . He also spoke out strongly against government funding for the arts , and helped pass legislation limiting states from exporting trash to other states . Coats is the first of 33 senators up for re - election in 1998 to announce he will not run again . Next year , Republicans will hold 55 Senate seats to the Democrats ' 45 . Outgoing Democratic Gov . Evan Bayh , who has set up an exploratory committee to consider a run for the Senate , was considered a strong candidate for the seat his father , Birch Bayh , held until he was defeated by Quayle in 1980 . The elder Bayh was the last Democratic senator from Indiana , although the state will have a Democratic governor and four out of 10 members of Congress are Democrats . In an early state - wide poll conducted recently , Bayh held a large lead over Coats in their potential 1998 matchup , although Coats was known to be a resourceful campaigner with strong fund - raising abilities . " Anybody who says Dan Coats got out because he was scared of Evan Bayh is flat wrong , " Joe Andrew , Indiana ' s Democratic Party chairman , said . " Sen . Coats and Gov . Bayh have always been good friends and worked well together . To most of us , it ' s not a surprise that he ' s getting out ; he ' s always been a supporter of term limits , " Andrew said . Coats won an interim election for Quayle ' s seat in 1990 , then beat back a challenge from Joe Hogsett , a popular state secretary of state , to win re - election in 1992 . Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith was among the state Republicans considered to have a chance to grab the party ' s nomination for Coats ' seat , although he was defeated handily in the November election to succeed Bayh as governor . State law prevented Bayh , seen as a rising star in the party who was keynote speaker at the Democratic Party convention in August , from running for governor again . Indiana ' s other Senate seat has been held by Richard Lugar , 64 , since 1976 . Lugar ' s fourth term expires in 2000 .

ATHLETICS - SURIN RULES THE BOARDS AT HAMILTON INDOOR GAMES . World indoor champion Bruny Surin continued to rule the boards Saturday as he won his third successive race on the 1997 Canadian indoor circuit at the Hamilton Indoor Games . Surin , twice the world indoor 60 - metre champion , won the 50 metres at the 87th Hamilton meet in 5 . 67 seconds . Canadian Olympic relay teammate Robert Esmie was second in 5 . 70 seconds and American Vince Henderson third in 5 . 79 . Surin ' s victory earned him $ 5 , 000 for capturing a three - race series that included 60 - metre races in Montreal on Friday and Saskatoon last weekend . " Robert and I are good friends , it was a nice competition , " said Surin , who collected relay gold along with Esmie in Atlanta . " The only thing I have to work on right now is my start . I ' ll need that for the world championships . " Last year ' s sprint series winner , Olympic 100 metres champion and world record holder Donovan Bailey , took the three - race series off . Bailey will compete next week indoors in Brazil , one of only two indoor meets he ' ll run this year . The absence of a marquee competitor like Bailey kept attendance down at the meet , which drew about 4 , 000 fans to Copps Coliseum , way off the 17 , 040 that watched Ben Johnson ' s first comeback in 1991 .

Dlr / yen firms but trade jitters resist . * Dlr / mark bulls bought dips but wary on Stoiber EMU delay talk * Light economic calendar this week provides little trade ammo . * Dlr / yen consolidating overnight slide . Big gain in Japan ' s 20 - day June trade surplus puts Tues May current acct in focus . The dollar closed higher , trimming early losses posted after talk of delay to European monetary union and a report showing Japan ' s preliminary June trade surplus more than doubled from last year . " All New York has done is come back off levels that were done this morning , " said Bob Near , a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Bank of New York . The dollar tumbled almost two yen in Asia and Europe - - erasing mild gains during the U . S . market holiday on Friday - - after Japan said its trade surplus rose 129 . 3 percent in the first 20 days of June , versus the same period a year ago . The dollar ' s slide gathered momentum after a Japanese Ministry of Finance official said that the yen ' s pronounced decline against the dollar earlier this year continues to have an effect on Japan ' s exports , dealers said . After touching 111 . 98 yen , the dollar steadied in New York , ending at 112 . 74 / 84 yen , versus 112 . 30 / 35 at the open . " It ' s off its lows but there is no question ( the trade figure ) was a number that certainly affected ( the dollar ) on the downside and continues to put pressure on dollar / yen , " said Bob Near , a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Bank of New York . Dollar / mark closed at 1 . 7530 / 40 , up from 1 . 7455 / 58 . Mark / yen traded heavily for much of the session , after setting a 23 - month low of 64 . 22 overnight . Japan ' s customs - cleared trade surplus rose to 453 . 20 billion yen , versus 197 . 65 billion yen a year ago , led by a 19 - percent jump in exports . The yen ' s buoyancy could weigh on the dollar through midweek , said traders anticipating the release at that time of the much more comprehensive Japanese current account data that are expected to reinforce signals of a swelling surplus . " We have to wait until Tuesday night / Wednesday morning when they get the current account from May , " Near said . Dollar / mark was tied to sterling / mark for much of the session , trailing it back up after a swift decline in the pound contributed to the dollar ' s slide overnight , dealers said . The dollar fell sharply in Europe , in part because of a jump in the mark against the pound after Britain reported industrial output declined 1 . 1 percent in May , the biggest drop since June 1993 . The mark was also lifted as political pressure mounted on Bonn to delay the planned 1999 launch of Europe ' s single currency , the euro . Any postponement of monetary union is expected to strengthen the mark by leaving its status as Europe ' s paramount currency intact for a while longer . On Monday the Financial Times newspaper reported that Edmund Stoiber , Prime Minister of Bavaria and a member of the Christian Social Union led by Finance Minister Theo Waigel , called for a " controlled delay " to the euro . But profit - taking took hold in U . S . trade and bulls grabbed cheap dollars , viewing the decline to 1 . 7420 as clearly contrary to the prevailing trend , dealers said . " People just got a little overzealous about that Financial Times article , " said Alfonso Alejo , manager of corporate foreign exchange at Sakura Bank Ltd . In other trade , the dollar rose to 1 . 4608 / 18 Swiss francs , from 1 . 4578 / 83 at the open . It rose to Canadian $ 1 . 3778 / 83 from C $ 1 . 3719 / 24 .

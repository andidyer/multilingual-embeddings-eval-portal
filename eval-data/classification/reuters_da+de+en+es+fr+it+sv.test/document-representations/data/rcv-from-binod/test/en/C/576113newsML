FOCUS - Fred Meyer to buy Smith ' s in $ 2 billion deal . Fred Meyer Inc . plans to buy Smith ' s Food & Drug Centres Inc . in a $ 2 billion deal that will create a regional food and general merchandise retailing giant , the companies said on Monday . " This merger of equals will create a merchandising powerhouse across the western United States , " said Robert Miller , chairman and chief executive officer of Portland , Ore . - based Fred Meyer . The proposed deal , which has been approved by the boards of both companies , would create a chain with 374 stores and estimated annual revenues of $ 7 billion , mostly from food . " The stores have very little overlap , and it opens up new high - growth markets for Fred Meyer , " said Bob Toomey , analyst at Piper Jaffray . " I think it gives Fred Meyer an exciting new growth avenue . " Executives of the two companies said they expected to save $ 65 million in annual expenses without closing any stores and estimated the merger would add at least 5 percent to 1998 earnings . Under the agreement , Smith ' s stockholders will receive 1 . 05 shares of Fred Meyer common stock for each share of Smith ' s they own . Based on Monday ' s closing prices , the deal values Smith ' s at about $ 44 . 76 a share . The $ 2 billion price tag includes about $ 730 million in stock and the assumption of $ 1 . 3 billion of debt . Smith ' s stock jumped $ 3 . 75 to close at $ 43 . 75 and Fred Meyer rose 75 cents to $ 42 . 625 , both on the New York Stock Exchange . Representatives of Fred Meyer will dominate the board of the merged company with seven of its 11 seats , but Smith ' s Chief Executive Officer Ronald Burkle will serve as chairman . Fred Meyer Chairman Robert Miller will become president and chief executive officer . Burkle also is chairman of the Yucaipa Cos . , an investment firm based in Century City , Calif . , that has been a major participant in the current wave of consolidation sweeping the food retailing industry . Grocery chains affiliated with Yucaipa include Dominick ' s Finer Foods Inc . in Northlake , Ill . , and California - based Ralphs Grocery Co . as well as Smith ' s . In a conference call with analysts , executives said the Smith ' s stores will retain their name and identity even in markets where they overlap with Fred Meyer . Fred Meyer is considered a pioneer in the one - stop shopping concept . Most of its 113 department stores carry a full selection of food as well as clothing , household goods and lawn and garden supplies . The company , which reported 1996 sales of $ 3 . 72 billion , also owns 109 smaller speciality stores , mostly jewelry stores in shopping malls . Smith ' s operates 152 stores in Arizona , New Mexico , Idaho , Nevada , Texas , Utah and Wyoming and posted 1996 sales of $ 2 . 89 billion . After a bitter three - month strike in 1994 , Fred Meyer has rebuilt its business and has been posting strong results recently , analysts said . Burkle said in the conference call that he expected the deal to close in 90 days , pending regulatory approval . Wall Street takeover specialists said it was possible a higher bid could emerge , although shareholders representing a majority of Smith ' s shares are backing the deal , according to the two companies .

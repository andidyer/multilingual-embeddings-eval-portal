Offer looms for Barings bondholders - newspaper . Thousands of bondholders who lost nearly 275 million stg ( $ 447 . 2 million ) in the collapse of British bank Barings will shortly hear details of a compensation offer , The Times newspaper reported on Wednesday . Negotiations brokered by the London - based City Disputes Panel are nearly complete , although any deal will need court approval , the paper said . Contributors to the settlement include Barclays Plc investment banking arm BZW , ABN - AMRO broking unit Hoare Govett and accountancy firm Coopers and Lybrand , according to The Times . Those in line for compensation are large life and pension funds such as Legal & General and Scottish Amicable , as well as many elderly investors , the newspaper reported . It said the settlement would fall far short of the total lost , and Barings preference shareholders would receive nothing . Barings collapsed in February 1995 after trader Nick Leeson ran up losses of 800 million pounds in massive unauthorised dealing . The bank was rescued by Dutch financial services giant Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV . - - London Newsroom + 44 - 171 - 542 - 8968 ( $ = 0 . 614 British Pounds )

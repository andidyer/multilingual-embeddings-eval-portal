Italy govt targets 1 . 8 pct CPI , 2 . 0 pct GDP in 98 . Italy ' s centre - left government has set a target of 1 . 8 percent inflation for 1998 , falling to 1 . 5 percent for 1999 and 2000 , the leader of the Cisl trades union confederation Sergio D ' Antoni told Reuters . D ' Antoni said the government ' s three - year plan of economic targets , known as the DPEF and due to be unveiled on Friday , would forecast gross domestic product growth of two percent next year , 2 . 5 percent in 1999 and 2 . 7 percent in 2000 . D ' Antoni and the leaders of Italy ' s two other big union confederations met Prime Minister Romano Prodi and other ministers on Tuesday night to discuss the forthcoming DPEF . " This is what they presented to us , " he said , speaking on the fringes of a meeting in Rome . Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said earlier that the document , which sets the government ' s financial goals and will outline its planned deficit cuts in 1998 and welfare reform proposals , would be unveiled on Friday . Prodi ' s centre - left cabinet will meet to approve the DPEF on Friday . Union leaders have warned they cannot accept unlimited welfare cuts and the hard - left Communist Refoundation party , whose support secures Prodi ' s parliamentary majority , opposes any cuts in social spending . - - Rome newsroom + 396 678 2501

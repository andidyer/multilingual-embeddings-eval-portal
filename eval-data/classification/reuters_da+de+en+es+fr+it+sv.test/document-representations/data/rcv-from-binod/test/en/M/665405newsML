US CREDIT OUTLOOK - - CPI , housing starts , production . A big batch of May economic data will attract the market ' s attention on Tuesday but none of it threatens to sink a buoyant market , analysts said . The market has climbed steadily since late May , fueled by reports of weak consumer demand and nearly absent inflation . Monday ' s action proved no exception to the upward trend . Even without fresh data to drive it higher , the benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond nonetheless rose 14 / 32 to 99 - 4 / 32 , its yield ending at 6 . 69 percent , the lowest closing yield for the bond since February 25 . The May Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) and new housing starts figures top Tuesday ' s calendar of economic reports . Economists polled by Reuters expect the CPI , due at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT , to be up 0 . 2 percent in May after a 0 . 1 percent April rise . The core CPI , the price measure without its more volatile food and energy items , is also expected to be up 0 . 2 percent , the economists said , after a 0 . 3 percent April increase . Housing starts remained flat , said economists , estimating new starts occurred at a seasonally adjusted , annualized rate of 1 . 47 million in May versus 1 . 473 million starts in April . After the housing and consumer price data releases at 0830 ECT / 1230 GMT , the Federal Reserve will report May industrial production and capacity utilization figures at 0915 EDT / 1315 GMT . Economists believe industrial production rose just 0 . 2 percent in May after remaining flat in April partly due to strikes in the automobile sector . The portion of the nation ' s mines , factories and utilities employed in that production , known as capacity utilization , is forecast at 83 . 4 percent , unchanged from the previous month and well below a level that would augur production bottlenecks and attendant inflationary pressures , economists said . Data on U . S . real earnings in May are due at 1000 EDT / 1400 GMT . Earnings fell 0 . 9 percent in April . A May forecast was not available . The data are not expected to impact the market . In the midst of the more comprehensive data for May , the market also gets two up - to - date snapshots of consumer demand in June . BTM / Schroders weekly chain store sales index for the week ended June 14 is due at 0900 EDT / 1300 GMT officially , but the index reading is usually rumored in the market before then . Lynch , Jones & Ryan Inc will report the Redbook Index for the same week later on Tuesday at 1455 EDT / 1855 GMT . The BTM Schroders index fell 0 . 9 percent in the week ended June 7 while the Redbook index rose 2 . 3 percent . Forecasts for the store sales indices due on Tuesday were not available . Analysts said if the market is to move higher from here , the gains are more likely to be made at the long end of the maturity range . " The market can go higher but you really can ' t rally the front end of the market at this point until you start to make a case for a Fed easing and I don ' t think most people are ready to do that yet , " said Dana Johnson , managing director and research head at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc . The long end of the maturity range , in contrast , has " a little more value , " said Johnson . " You could see the long bond yield move down to 6 - 5 / 8 percent and circle around that area . " Johnson said he believes that the middle of the trading range for the bond yield this year is more like seven percent rather than 6 - 5 / 8 percent , but that for now , " momentum and the correct belief that the Fed will not change policy in July allows the market to pursue lower yields in the near term .

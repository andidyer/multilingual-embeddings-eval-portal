U . S . durables drop shows soft manufacturing sector . A surprising 1 . 7 percent drop in U . S . durable goods orders in December after a revised decline of the same magnitude in November points to a fairly soft manufacturing sector , experts said . " All in all , I would say it ' s a weak number suggesting some pretty anemic production numbers for the next couple of months , " said Evelina Tainer , chief economist at Indosuez Carr Futures . " This should reassure market participants who were worried about a booming economy . This is not booming in the least , " she added . The 1 . 7 percent decline in December durable goods orders contrasted sharply with the 1 . 2 percent gain predicted , on average , by economists in a Reuters poll . Excluding defense , December orders fell 1 . 5 percent , a reading well below the forecasted 2 . 2 percent increase . The shrinkage in orders in December and November represents the first back - to - back declines since a dip of 0 . 1 percent in January 1996 and a 2 . 5 percent slide in February . Experts noted that durable goods are viewed as a leading indicator . Therefore , the figures reported on Wednesday could suggest slower economic growth in the first quarter of 1997 . " We don ' t have to worry too much about fourth quarter GDP ( gross domestic product ) , " said Christopher Low , senior economist at HSBC Markets . " It ' s going to be strong . . . despite the weakness in orders two months in a row . " However , Low added , " It does make you wonder about the first quarter , though . " Experts particularly noted weakness in electrical machinery orders , which tumbled 12 . 5 percent in December after plunging a revised 10 . 2 percent in November . " Capital equipment is the backbone of U . S . exports , and the orders weakness , particularly in electrical equipment , could very well be weakness in overseas orders , " Low said . He said the weak durable goods data may be an indication of both weakness in capital spending as well as in exports . Low emphasized that the tremendous rally in the dollar since early 1995 has made U . S . goods much more expensive . The dollar sank to a post - World War II low of 79 . 75 yen on April 19 , 1995 . Since then , the U . S . currency has gained over 50 percent against the yen and wracked up gains of a lesser magnitude against the mark . As for what the Federal Reserve may make of the surprisingly weak durable goods report , some experts contended the data would provide the central bank with another reason to keep rates steady . " I think there is no question that the Fed will hold off in February , " said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist and senior vice president at Norwest Corp . " On the heels of a relatively harmless Employment Cost Index ( report ) yesterday , this number implies that there is really no inflationary pressure and the strong economic momentum we apparently had in the fourth quarter probably did not carry into 1997 , " Sohn said . The Fed ' s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee meets on February 4 - 5 . The Employment Cost Index rose 0 . 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 . ( ( - - 212 - 859 - 1668 ) )

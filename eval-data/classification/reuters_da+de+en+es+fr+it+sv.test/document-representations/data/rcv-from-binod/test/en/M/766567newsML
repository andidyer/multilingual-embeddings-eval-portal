Dollar gains vs . yen on concerns about Japan . The dollar edged higher vs . the yen Wednesday , aided by concern about a weak Japanese economy and fears of renewed tension in U . S . - Japan trade relations . The dollar was little changed against the German mark , while it briefly rallied to a new 47 - month high against the Swiss franc before retreating over the course of the day . The U . S . currency soared overnight against the yen on news that Japan ' s industrial output dropped 3 . 1 percent and retail sales fell 2 . 3 percent in June . The reports disappointed investors who had bet on a Japanese recovery to bring about higher Japanese interest rates . Currency traders sold the yen heavily on the economic news , sending the dollar to a fresh 2 - 1 / 2 - month high of 118 . 95 yen . But talk of renewed tension in U . S . - Japan trade relations took some steam out of the rally by late afternoon . Traders cited rumours that U . S . automakers wanted Washington to review trade barriers against Japan after U . S . Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky suggested late Monday that Japan had fallen short of fulfilling a pledge to open its market . " There were big sellers waiting just above 118 . 50 yen , " said Jeffrey Yu , senior dealer at Sanwa Bank Ltd . in New York . Many traders still have a vivid memories of the tense bilateral trade negotiations in 1994 and the dollar ' s ensuing fall to a post - Second World War low of 79 . 75 yen . The dollar settled at 118 . 41 yen late Wednesday , up from 118 . 35 yen late Tuesday . The dollar eked out slim gains against the mark , rising to 1 . 8370 marks from 1 . 8365 on Tuesday . On Monday , the dollar surged to its highest level against the mark since 1989 , but traders said its bull run has been tempered since then by growing concerns that the Bundesbank would raise German interest rates to counter inflation . But David Horner , first vice president at Merrill Lynch , played down the chances of a German rate hike this summer . " Talk of a Bundesbank rate rise is a paper tiger threat with German unemployment at 11 percent , " Horner said . " By holding German rates too high for too long , the Bundesbank put the German economy in such a precarious position that it ends up undermining the currency , " Horner added . " If they had eased ( rates ) a year ago , the German currency may have been pressured but it would have rebounded by now along with the economy . " In other currencies , the British pound rose to $ 1 . 6290 from Tuesday ' s close of $ 1 . 6275 . The dollar fell to 1 . 5130 Swiss francs vs . 1 . 5180 Tuesday . It slipped to Canadian $ 1 . 3814 from C $ 1 . 3847 .

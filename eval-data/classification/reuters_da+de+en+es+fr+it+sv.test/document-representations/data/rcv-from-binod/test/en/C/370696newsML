Ericsson says strong crown hit 1996 result .

Ericsson said the crown combined with competition hurt the company ' s gross margin . Ericsson said its gross margins weakened . " Gross margins have weakened as a result of increased competition , currency effects and increased risks which have been taken into account in the report concerning changes in technology and markets , " Ericsson said .

Ericsson ' s total costs for research and development rose to 17 . 47 billion crowns from 15 . 09 billion .

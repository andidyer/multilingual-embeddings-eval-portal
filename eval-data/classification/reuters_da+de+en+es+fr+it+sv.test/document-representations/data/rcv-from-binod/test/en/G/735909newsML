NASA astronaut to train for Mir repair . NASA has cleared astronaut Michael Foale to train for a risky internal spacewalk to restore some power to the ailing Russian Mir space station , a senior official of the U . S . space agency said on Thursday . " We have given the go to the Russians for Mike beginning the training , " said Frank Culbertson , a veteran shuttle commander who heads NASA ' s joint missions with Russia . Foale was asked to step in when Mir commander Vasily Tsibliyev developed an irregular heartbeat and was ruled unfit for the demanding repair work . The spacewalk would involve opening up the airless Spektr science module , which had been punctured in a crash with a resupply ship , and connecting power cables to restore power from the module ' s electricity - generating solar panels . The station lost half its power and was robbed of its best batteries when the cargo craft ploughed into the station on June 25 and the damaged module had to be sealed off . The internal spacewalk that had been tentatively scheduled for July 24 was likely to be delayed because of the latest problems aboard Mir , which caused a total loss of power . " We are not sure what the schedule will be at this time because of the problem last night , " Culbertson said . " This puts them a day or two behind on the training plan . " Russian and American space authorities will meet two days before the spacewalk to decide whether to proceed with the repair work . Foale and Mir flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin were to practice the repair before the actual spacewalk and would carry out a full dress rehearsal wearing their spacesuits . The NASA astronaut does not have a tailor - made spacesuit and the dress rehearsal will be important to ensure he fits comfortably in Tsibliyev ' s suit . Culbertson said he was confident that Foale , who performed a spacewalk from the shuttle in February 1995 and has trained to use the Russian space suit , would be up to the task . " Mike didn ' t have any problem with this , " he said . " He ' s a well - experienced crewmember , and training on orbit in a suit would be the best training session you could ask for . There is some risk , but we believe the risk is minimal . "

Canadian bonds rally to close higher after data . Canada ' s bond market rallied to close stronger on Friday amid investor relief that U . S . job growth was not higher . " You had a market that was overly defensive going into the numbers , " ABN - AMRO economist Andrew Pyle said . February ' s non - farm payrolls jumped by 339 , 000 jobs from January . Economists polled by Reuters forecast a gain of 230 , 000 jobs , but market players had feared worse . Canada ' s 30 - year benchmark bond rose C $ 0 . 75 to C $ 111 . 25 to yield 7 . 051 percent against the U . S . 30 - year benchmark , which gained 25 / 32 to yield 6 . 82 percent . The spread totalled 23 basis points . " The market ' s got everything backwards , " Pyle added .

In Canada , February ' s employment numbers were weaker than expected . Full time employment fell by 38 , 000 jobs from January and the jobless rate stayed flat at 9 . 7 percent , higher than economists ' expectations of 9 . 6 percent . Some analysts forecast the U . S .

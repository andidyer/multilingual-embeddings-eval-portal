U . S . lottery that never pays off . Players of the seven - state lottery " Daily Millions " have a five - month losing streak - - leaving local governments the winners . Nearly 34 million $ 1 tickets have been sold , but no one has matched the six numbers needed to win a $ 1 million prize , the Iowa - based lottery said Friday . Based on statistical probability , there should have been three or four winners by now and the chances of a five - month - long losing streak figured to be 1 in 38 . Unlike the popular multi - state " Powerball " lottery and various state lotteries , the top prize for " Daily Millions " stays at $ 1 million and does not grow if there is no winner . On the other hand , players who correctly pick the six numbers do not have to share a jackpot . About half the proceeds from ticket sales have been set aside to pay winners - - if there are any . Sales are down because of the dry spell . Participating states include Iowa , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska , Rhode Island , Wisconsin , West Virginia and the District of Columbia .

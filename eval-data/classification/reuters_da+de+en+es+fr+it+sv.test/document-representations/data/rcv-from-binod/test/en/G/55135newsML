GOLF - PARNEVIK LEAVES BALLESTEROS WITH RYDER CUP DILEMMA . Had ex - Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher selected Jesper Parnevik for his 1995 European team , the 31 - year - old Swede would no doubt be a cast - iron certainty for a repeat appearance in Spain next year . A five - shot victory on Sunday in the Lancome Trophy provided a perfect reminder of his talents but unless circumstances change there is every chance of Parnevik being left out in the cold again . Disillusion over Gallacher ' s decision prompted the U . S . - based player to surrender his European Tour membership by refusing to play 11 events , preventing him from collecting Ryder Cup points in any tournaments . That leaves his fate in the hands of new captain Seve Ballesteros who will have a wide selection of potential wildcard choices and has little room for manoeuvre . " I was disappointed last year , " Parnevik said . " I was asked to come over in the middle of the year and I thought I would come over and make an effort to qualify . " Sadly , he did not quite make the top 10 for automatic selection and Gallacher , choosing to overlook his triumph in the 1995 Scandinavian Masters as well as his runner - up finish in the 1994 British Open , declined to make a wildcard offer . Parnevik was left to lick his wounds and decided it was time to concentrate his main efforts elsewhere " I decided I would focus more on the U . S . Tour , try to boost my position on the money list and get into more major events . " he said . He duly made last month ' s U . S . PGA championship , where his fifth - place finish earned him a spot at next year ' s Masters . " It will be my first Masters . Most players my age have played several already , " he said . " Seve wants me to come back to Europe to qualify but I don ' t want to give up a year in the U . S . for the Ryder Cup , even though it would be one of the highest honours you can get to play . " My first two years over there I played well but did not get the results I wanted on new courses with fast greens and different conditions , " he said . " Now I ' m getting used to that type of game . " Three top 10 finishes in the last month , including third place at the Greater Milwaukee Open where he bogeyed the final hole to miss getting into a play - off , have reinforced the message . " I feel my game is just about to take off , " he said on Sunday . He now intends to take the rest of the year off to relax , having played half a dozen events in Europe as well as 20 or so in the U . S . each year for the past three years . European number one Colin Montgomerie was full of admiration for the way Parnevik stuck to the task after the Scot had opened the final round on Sunday with five successive birdies . Parnevik matched the last two of them to trail by only two shots and added two more the rest of the way without dropping a shot , until he bogeyed the last when he could well afford it . Montgomerie ' s game disintegrated to an extent neither man could account for . " To be honest I didn ' t hit a golf shot after the fifth hole . I played remarkably badly , " Montgomerie said . Parnevik could hardly disagree . " Those five birdies , he was in a league of his own . He looked as if he would never made a mistake . " But he got careless with his second shot at the sixth , went for the pin at the seventh and found the water . His game was never the same after that . " Three more bogeys from the 13th plus another at the last completed the Scot ' s nightmare of dropping six shots over the last 13 holes . Montgomerie left no doubt about his feelings concerning Parnevik . " I repeat what I said before : we cannot go to Spain to defend the Ryder Cup next year without Jesper Parnevik , " he said . " The start I had would have finished most people , but not him . " All credit to Jesper for plugging away in determined fashion . That ' s what it takes . I left the door open for him and he walked right through it . "

Former RTZ team founds mining insurance firm . A group of former employees of mining giant RTZ - CRA on Monday announced they had set up an insurance company specifically targeting the mining industry . The insurance firm - - called Mining Insurance Ltd ( MIL ) - - is set up to win support for its specialised approach from established insurers and re - insurers , said Geoff Saunders , one of the men behind MIL . MIL is a mutual and insurance companies can become members and give financial backing . " About 30 companies have signed up as members so far . We put the question out as to whether they want to put more capital in and technically own it or whether it should be held in trust for their use , " Saunders told Reuters in a telephone interview . MIL , a Bermuda - based company , so far has a capital base of only $ 250 , 000 . Saunders , who used to be responsible for RTZ ' s risk management , heads Strategic Management Group ( SRM ) , which is to bring mining firms and insurers together . SRM is financially backed by Swiss re - insurer Centre Re , which already has some experience in the mining sector . SRL aims to create a specialist insurance market similar to that existing for the shipping and aviation industry . It will enable firms to separately insure parts of the mining business , such as extraction or smelting , rather than have for example a fire policy for the whole operation . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

WBK tender offer seen as formality . Allied Irish Banks which seeks a majority stake in Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy ( WBK ) was bound by law to call a public tender to buy WBK shares but its price is likely to discourage any offers , analysts said . AIB , which now has 45 . 7 percent of WBK has an option agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) to buy all EBRD shares in WBK and gain a 60 . 2 percent control of the Polish bank . AIB last month bought 9 . 4 percent of shares out of the EBRD portfolio at 13 . 95 zlotys and now was offering to buy all remaining WBK listed shares including the remaining 14 . 5 percent EBRD stake at 14 zlotys per share . Analysts said the tender price , well below Wednesday ' s 18 . 2 zlotys , when WBK last traded before the tender announcement , showed AIB was not interested in boosting its WBK stake beyond the 60 . 2 percent level . " It seems AIB doesn ' t intend to buy more than 60 percent , " said Kamil Kalemba , a trader at ING Barings Securities . Under Polish law any investor intending to gain a majority stake in a publicly traded company is obliged to call a public tender offer to buy all the remaining shares . Analysts said the price set at the tender was within expectations and was unlikely to affect WBK performance on Tuesday . WBK trade was suspended on Monday . - - Warsaw Newsroom + 48 22 653 9700

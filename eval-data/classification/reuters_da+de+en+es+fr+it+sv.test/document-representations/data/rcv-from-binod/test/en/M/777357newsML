Coconut Oil - More supplies seen pulling down prices . Coconut oil prices , which hit a three - year low last week , are expected to drop further as the Philippines approaches the peak of its copra harvest season , Manila vegetable oil traders said on Monday . " It seems like coconut oil prices may breach the $ 500 per tonne FOB support , " a senior Manila trader said . Traders said coconut oil prices fell by an average of $ 25 per tonne FOB last week , closing at a low of $ 515 per tonne last Friday . " This is the lowest that we have gone since August 1994 , " the trader said . The trader said he expected the Philippines to ship more than 100 , 000 tonnes coconut oil to both the United States and Rotterdam this month . " Historically , August is our strongest month , " he said . Coconut oil exports last month jumped by 25 . 8 percent to 75 , 050 tonnes compared to the year - ago 59 , 671 tonnes , according to preliminary data from trade group United Coconut Association of the Philippines ( UCAP ) . The trade group also reported that coconut oil exports in the first seven months of the year inched up by 2 . 5 percent to 492 , 529 tonnes compared with 480 , 341 tonnes in the same period last year . Traders said they expected better coconut harvests in the country for the rest of the year due to more rains in coconut growing areas in recent weeks . The Philippines is at the peak of its rainy season , which starts in April and lasts up to September . However , the Philippine weather bureau forecasts drought due to the El Nino weather phenomenon starting in the last quarter of the year . Vegetable oil traders said they do not see any impact from El Nino on the coconut crop . " Typhoons are the worst enemies of coconut trees . It seems there are less this year due to this freak weather , " said another trader . - - manila . newsroom @ reuters . com - - Dolly Aglay ( 63 2 ) 841 - 8936 , Fax 817 - 6267

S . Treasuries as fears of a Fed tightening once again gripped the market . * The 10 - year bond futures contract slithered back through 92 . 000 and towards a familiar 91 . 920 / 91 . 980 trading band . Tuesday ' s euphoria in the Australian bond market after an aggressively bid Treasury bond tender proved short - lived as the U . S . market once again weighed heavily on the market , traders said . Local bond futures contracts went into retreat during afterhours trading as the fear of a tightening by the Federal Reserve reared its head again sending U . S . Treasuries lower and the key 30 - year bond yield back above 7 . 0 percent . The local December 10 - year bond futures contract ended SYCOM trade at 91 . 980 after a high of 92 . 095 , and down from Tuesday ' s perky 92 . 080 pit close . The contract is heading towards a familiar 91 . 920 / 91 . 980 trading band , which on many occasions contained the now expired September position . There is also a small gap on the December chart between 91 . 905 and 91 . 935 left after Monday ' s price spike . On the upside , the market only part filled a gap between 92 . 060 and 92 . 110 from August 26 during Tuesday ' s advance , but with the U . S . market back in the doldrums the December position may struggle to get back above 92 . 000 . Remarks by a Fed official saying the consensus at the central bank appears to be centred around 25 basis points rate hike when the FOMC meets on September 24 triggered the sell - off . The local market faces August merchandise imports at 11 . 30 a . m . ( 0130 GMT ) . Median forecasts centre on a 2 . 2 percent rise after falling for three successive months , according to a Reuters survey of economists . Forecasts range from a 1 . 0 percent fall to a 5 . 0 percent increase with those seeing a rise citing the inclusion of A $ 100 million aircraft and the softer performance of Australian dollar during the month . However , traders said the data has lost some of its importance with the current account deficit now seemingly more under control after the repeated blowouts last year . - - Colin Brinsden 61 - 2 373 - 1800

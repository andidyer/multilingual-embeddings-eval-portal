Union Pacific sees Pennzoil adding to EPS by 2000 . Union Pacific Resources Group Inc earnings per share will be diluted by 50 percent in 1998 if the company succeeds in its $ 6 . 4 billion hostile offer for Pennzoil Co , Union Pacific ' s chief financial officer said in a telephone interview . Sam Smith said that the deal would be accretive to earnings per share from the year 2000 , but that that would not offset any EPS dilution for the preceeding years . " However , we are confident that the deal would beat street forecasts of adding nine cents per share to cashflow for 1998 , " Smith said . He said that the company was not worried by being labeled a domestic U . S . natural gas player through the deal which would rank it 10th in terms of U . S . reserves . " We are comfortable down to a natural gas price of $ 1 . 50 per thousand cubic feet because of our other mineral and royalty interests , " Smith said . Most analysts believe that natural gas prices in 1998 will be in the region of $ 2 . 19 per thousand cubic feet . ( ( - - David Chance New York Newsroom 212 859 1902 ) )

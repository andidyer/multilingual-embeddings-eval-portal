The prime rate , which is applied to loans of one year or more to Japanese long - term credit banks ' most creditworthy clients , is reviewed every month , reflecting market trends . The prime rate , which is also a key reference rate for other banks making long - term loans , was raised by 0 . 6 point to 3 . 1 percent in May due to a surge in long - term bond yields in reaction to firmness in Tokyo stocks . The IBJ customarily sets its prime rate 0 . 9 point above the coupon rate of its monthly issued five - year debenture , which is the benchmark in Japan ' s debenture market . Bank debentures are the long - term credit banks ' major fund - raising tool . IBJ ' s May 2 . 2 percent five - year debenture was traded at a yield of 2 . 02 percent on Monday afternoon after trading at 2 . 10 percent on Friday . The other two long - term credit banks , the Long - Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd and Nippon Credit Bank Ltd , are to announce their new prime rates and terms for June debentures on Tuesday . - - Tokyo Treasury Desk + 81 - 3 - 3432 - 8570

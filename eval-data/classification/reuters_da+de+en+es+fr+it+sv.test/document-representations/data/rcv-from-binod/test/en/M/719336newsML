Falling gold price another boon to bond market . If a solid economy , low inflation and a Federal Reserve that appears set to hold interest rates steady are not enough to cheer bond investors , they now have another reason - - plunging gold prices . Amid the summer doldrums , which have seen trading volume drop significantly , Treasury bonds got a lift when the Australian central bank said last week that it had sold a big piece of its gold reserves in favour of owning government securities , which sent gold to a 12 - year low . The price of gold tumbled below $ 320 an ounce from around $ 340 in early June and from the mid - $ 350s in March . Gold prices had jumped to a seven - year high of $ 420 an ounce in February 1996 before ending the year at about $ 365 . On Thursday , August gold futures recovered slightly , rising $ 1 . 90 to $ 320 . 80 an ounce on New York ' s Commodity Exchange . Many experts expect others to follow Australia ' s surprising move , as worldwide inflation rates come down . Gold has been a traditional hedge against inflation . " Holding a non - interest bearing asset that is deflating in price is a lousy investment , " said Paul McCulley , chief economist at UBS Securities LLC . A number of European central banks , such as the Netherlands and Belgium , already have reduced gold reserves . Canada got the ball rolling in the late 1970s when it liquidated gold reserves . According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - - where gold is stored for central banks of about 55 other countries - - the number of gold bars in its vault has dropped to about 700 , 000 from 900 , 000 a decade ago . " The question is : do you earn interest on your reserves , which would say hold Treasuries or other ( countries ' ) bonds , or do you hold gold , which doesn ' t earn interest , " said Larry Dyer , Treasury strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp . The gold sales by Australia and other central banks was " a vote to earn interest , " Dyer said . Andy Smith , precious metals analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland in London , said the top 10 central banks " give up $ 15 billion a year by holding gold rather than holding interest bearing assets . " He added that almost certainly other central banks will increase sales of gold reserves . " It ' s a matter of who , when and how much , " Smith said . " ' If ' is not in doubt . " Yet analysts do not believe the impact on Treasury bonds will that be noticeable , since the amount of securities bought is tiny compared to the total size of the market . For example , Australia sold $ 1 . 8 billion worth of gold and the funds were then spread among several countries ' bond markets . The U . S . Treasury market alone often trades between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion worth of bonds on any given day . But Treasuries still benefit from falling gold prices , which suggest confidence that inflation will remain subdued . Inflation is a bond investor ' s worst enemy as it erodes the returns on long - term investments . " Inflation has gone out of style and that ' s great for Treasuries , " said John Ryding , senior economist at Bear , Stearns & Co . Inc . " What gold is telling us is people are buying into the lower - inflation outlook . " That is not just in the United States . " Central banks everywhere are against inflation , " Ryding said . The drop in gold prices " tells you that there is not much of a problem on that front . " The Fed held rates steady when its policy - makers met in July and in May . The central bankers raised short - term rates in March , the first increase in more than two years , in a bid to ward off inflation .

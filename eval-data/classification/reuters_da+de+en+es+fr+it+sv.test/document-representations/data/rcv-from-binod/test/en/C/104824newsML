S . Africa wine co - op KWV plans to turn into company . South Africa ' s giant wine co - operative KWV said on Wednesday it planned to transform itself into a public company in the biggest shake - up of the organisation since its formation in 1918 . Chairman Laurens Jonker urged farmer members at a packed meeting in the heart of the country ' s wineland to give the plan the necessary 75 percent support to ensure modernisation of the industry . " This is an urgent and essential restructuring and repositioning in the South African wine industry , so as to serve wine farmers effectively , " he said of the measures , which are due to take effect from April 30 , 1997 . Under the scheme , KWV ' s assets would be unbundled to its 4 , 700 farmer members with the creation of a new holding company , KWV Group Ltd , allowing KWV to conduct its business fully in company form . Jonker said that as a company KWV would have a better international marketing profile and would be better positioned to build capital . As the country ' s premier export agency , KWV has been at the forefront of a surge in South African wine exports , triggered by the collapse of apartheid and the ending of trade sanctions . In just two years from 1993 to 1995 South African wine exports have leapt by 208 percent to 7 . 7 million cases , and that record should be easily beaten in the current year , industry experts predict . The co - op ' s turnover last year totalled 479 . 7 million rand ( $ 105 . 8 million ) up from 411 . 1 million in 1994 . Under the proposals , growers would keep control of KWV via a new cooperative , KWV Co - operative Ltd , which would have no assets but would exercise control by means of " Class B " shares , carrying no vote but outweighing ordinary shares by four to one . That control structure would rule out any immediate listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange , although some farmers said such a move was both inevitable and desirable in the long run . Advocates of flotation cited the example of former dairy co - op Bonnita whose shares have performed strongly since its listing in August 1994 . The plan as proposed would allow the restructured group to continue certain market stabilisation measures , including surplus removal and compulsory pooling . - - Ben Hirschler , Cape Town newsroom + 27 21 252238 ( $ = 4 . 534 South African Rand )

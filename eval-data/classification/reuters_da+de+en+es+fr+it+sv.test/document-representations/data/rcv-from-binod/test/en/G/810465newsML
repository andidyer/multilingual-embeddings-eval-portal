Iran parliament starts debate on moderate ' s cabinet . The Iranian parliament on Tuesday began a crucial debate on new President Mohammad Khatami ' s proposed cabinet , state radio reported . " The session is official . Please read out the agenda , " said parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq - Nouri . A secretary of the parliament said the session " is to review the proposed cabinet . " Khatami was on hand to introduce the cabinet to the parliament , or Majlis , which will vet his 22 nominees . It was expected to have three five - hour debates on the make - up of the cabinet before casting a final vote on Wednesday . A moderate 54 - year - old Moslem Shi ' ite cleric , Khatami is likely to see at least one of his nominees rejected by the Islamic conservatives and hardline radicals in the 270 - seat parliament . Despite the expected loss of a minimum one minister in a sensitive domestic portfolio , Khatami will still emerge with the majority of his cabinet largely intact and his election mandate for social and economic change undamaged , analysts said . The final make - up of the cabinet is seen as crucial in setting a reforming tone of Khatami ' s four - year term . " The Majlis ( parliament ) will approve most of the nominees , but a few who are not qualified will be rejected , " rightist deputy Samad Qasempour told the Iran News on Tuesday . " Everything is possible . However , it is not possible to predict which of them will get the vote of confidence and who will not , " Nateq - Nouri told the official news agency IRNA on Monday . Khatami was swept into power during national elections last May after scooping up the votes of Iranian youth , women and middle classes . They saw in him a leader able to inject more social and economic freedoms into the 18 - year - old Islamic republic . He was sworn into office on August 4 .

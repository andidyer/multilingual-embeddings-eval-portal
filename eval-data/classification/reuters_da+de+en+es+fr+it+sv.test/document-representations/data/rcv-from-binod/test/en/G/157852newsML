Perot challenges Clinton to debate on ethics . Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot , after delivering a scathing attack on White House ethics on Wednesday , challenged President Bill Clinton to defend himself in an election - eve televised debate . " I want to spend an hour candidly discussing with the president the criminal and ethical charges pending against him , his wife , his associates and other members of his administration , " Perot told a cheering crowd of about 2 , 500 students and supporters at the University of Pennsylvania . " I invite President Clinton to step forward and tell the voters the truth , before they go to the polls , on all these allegations made against him , " he said . The White House rejected Perot ' s offer , saying the president had set his schedule for the balance of the campaign . Perot said he had purchased an hour of prime - time television time next Monday on the ABC network , at a cost of $ 1 million . Perot said he would be willing to share that time with Clinton to give the president an opportunity to answer questions about scandals involving campaign fund - raising , foreign influence , Whitewater and other issues . " This will give him ( Clinton ) an opportunity to clear his name , set the record straight , and could assure him of a landslide if he will do it , " he said . White House spokesman Mike McCurry , rejecting the debate challenge , said : " We ' ve identified the issues we ' ll be discussing , including campaign financing . I think we ' ll be doing our events , not Mr Perot ' s . " In his speech , Perot said Clinton had violated ethical standards in numerous ways , including through recently reported ties to Indonesian business interests , campaign financing and spending practices and his refusal to rule out pardons for persons connected with the Whitewater financial scandal . He reiterated charges that the nation risked a drawn - out , Watergate - style scandal if Clinton did not answer accusations against him before the Nov . 5 election . " Today we have special prosecutors investigating our president , his wife and his business associates involved in these same matters and we are headed directly toward a second Watergate in 1997 , " he said . Perot also echoed Republican candidate Bob Dole ' s charges that voters had failed to show " outrage " at unethical political behaviour . " What happened to our sense of decency , what happened to our sense of honour . Is there no sense of outrage anymore no matter what the president of the United States does ? , " he said . But Perot also criticised Dole for the Republican candidate ' s ties to the sugar industry . Perot has struggled to recreate the enthusiasm among disaffected major - party voters that helped him capture 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 election . This year , he has been stymied by weaker support in the polls and a relative lack of publicity . But after a period in the spotlight last week , when he rejected as " weird and totally inconsequential " a request by Dole to quit the race , and began his strong attacks on Clinton ' s character , Perot ' s poll standing has risen . The latest Reuters tracking poll showed Perot ' s support was now above the eight percent mark , having risen by three points in the past week . Clinton ' s lead in the poll fell to single digits for the first time since October 24 . He led Dole by 9 . 8 percentage points as the number of undecided voters rose above 13 percent . But Dole ' s support remained stuck at 33 percent .

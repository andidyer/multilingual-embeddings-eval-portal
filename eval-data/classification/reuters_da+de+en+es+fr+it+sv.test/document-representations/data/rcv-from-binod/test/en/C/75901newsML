Pulp prices may not rise by Oct 1 - industry sources . Pulp producers may find it difficult to gain acceptance for advertised price increases to between $ 620 and $ 630 dollars per tonne as early as they hoped , industry sources said on Wednesday . " Perhaps we shouldn ' t expect a rapid upturn ( to $ 630 ) . . . what we can assume is that we will not achieve the full price level by October 1 , " Jaroslav Havlicek , president of Swedish pulp producer Rottneros told Reuters . Softwood pulp prices are currently set at between $ 560 and $ 580 per tonne , but most producers have advertised increases to take effect on October 1 . Havlicek said there were some uncertainties that would have to be cleared up before a price increase could be accepted . " A lot depends on what happens to the Norscan stock ( of market pulp in the Nordic countries ) in September , " he said . Another factor affecting pulp prices would be fine paper prices , industry sources said . Fine paper producers have announced price increases to take effect in Europe during the autumn . If these were to be rejected by the market , it will probably be more difficult for mills to accept an increase in pulp prices . Lars Lofgren , head of marketing for cut sheets at Swedish SCA ' s Wifsta mill , said that price increases for uncoated sheet had been implemented on some markets . " We have introduced price increase in the Netherlands , Belgium and Germany . We ' ll raise prices in France on October 1 , and it looks like they ' ll go through , " he said . Lofgren said he expected stable development in the autumn . " Order intake for uncoated paper looks like it ' s recovering , " he said , adding that the stock situation in the distribution lead is normal in Europe . - - Stockholm newsroom , + 46 - 8 - 700 1006

Fergie stops bid to halt revealing memoirs . Britain ' s Duchess of York on Thursday pulled out of a legal attempt to prevent publication of a book that threatens to reveal intimate details of her affair with her " financial adviser , " John Bryan . The Duchess , better known as Fergie , had risked being called to give evidence in public about her private life in the case in which she was seeking to block publication of " Fergie , Her Secret Life , " written by Bryan ' s former friend Alan Starkie . " The matter has been resolved . An agreement has been reached with her lawyers , " a publishing industry source said . Her publishers said that Fergie , who was called on by the court to provide 500 , 000 pounds ( $ 782 , 700 ) as security against losing the case , had decided not go ahead after receiving assurances the book would not contain any material damaging to the royal family . The ex - wife of Queen Elizabeth ' s second son , Prince Andrew , launched her court battle six weeks ago . While still married to Andrew , Fergie , was photographed frolicking with Bryan in the south of France as her two young daughters looked on . An infamous picture of Bryan sucking the toe of the topless duchess was splashed across newspapers and magazines worldwide . Fergie , who is reported to have large debts , is due to publish her own memoirs in November , although she is bound by a clause in her divorce agreement that she may not reveal details about her life within the royal family . Starkie ' s publisher , Michael O ' Mara Books , says it believes Fergie wanted to prevent publication of " Fergie , Her Secret Life " so that it would not threaten sales of her own memoirs . It said in September it could seek damages of two million pounds if she succeeded in preventing its publication . ( $ 1 = . 6388 Pound )

HORSE RACING - SILVER CHARM GALLOPS DISTANCE IN PREAKNESS PRACTICE . Kentucky Derby winner Silver Charm galloped his usual mile and a half at Pimlico Thursday in preparation for Saturday ' s 122nd running of the Preakness Stakes , the middle leg of the Triple Crown . " He might run better on Saturday , " said exercise rider Larry Damore . " But he couldn ' t train any better . " Silver Charm , who drew the seventh post position Wednesday , was installed as the 9 - 5 morning line favourite . The second choice at 2 - 1 is Captain Bodgit , a close runner - up to Silver Charm at the Derby . Captain Bodgit jogged and galloped a mile at Bowie . Trainer Gary Capuano said he had been looking for an inside post position for Saturday ' s race , but his horse will have to break from the ninth gate on the tight turning course . " That ' s what we got . It ' s what we have to deal with , " Capuano said . The current third choice is Free House , who finished a strong third in the Derby . Free House , with jockey Kent Desormeaux replacing David Flores in the saddle , drew the favourable fourth slot and is listed at 9 - 2 . Saturday ' s race over 1 3 / 16 miles will have a field of 10 , six of whom did not run in the Kentucky Derby . The best of the non - Derby starters appears to be Lexington Derby winner Touch Gold , who drew the fifth post and is listed at 5 - 1 .

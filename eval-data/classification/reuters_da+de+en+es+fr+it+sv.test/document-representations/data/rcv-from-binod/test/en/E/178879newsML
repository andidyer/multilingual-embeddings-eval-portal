IMF says no immediate cash for Zimbabwe reforms . Zimbabwe will not get any immediate funding from the International Monetary Fund for a five - year economic reform programme it plans to launch later this year , a senior IMF official said on Monday . Michael Nowak , division chief for the IMF Southern African Department , said President Robert Mugabe ' s government might get some crucial aid in the financial year starting next July after providing detailed plans on how it intended to fight runaway state spending and a big budget deficit . " The IMF is ready to assist once this area has been addressed , " Nowak told a news conference in Harare . " The process is long . . . and I think we should be looking at mid - 1997 , in the new financial year , " he said .

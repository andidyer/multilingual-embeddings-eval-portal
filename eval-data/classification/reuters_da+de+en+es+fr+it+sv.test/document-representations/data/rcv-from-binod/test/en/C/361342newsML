U . S . firm to offer GDRs in Egypt brewer . The U . S . - based firm which bought a majority in Egypt ' s sole brewery al - Ahram Beverages will transform 70 percent of its holdings into a global depositary receipt offering , an agent said on Thursday . Hamdy el - Rashad , chairman of El - Rashad Securities Brokerage , which will execute the transaction for the Luxor Group , told Reuters that the offering was expected to be finished in February and that the GDRs would be listed in London . International securities house HSBC James Capel is the lead manager of the issue and Nomura Securities are also involved in the deal , he added . " The Luxor Group is keeping in Egyptian stocks a five percent stake and will transfer the rest into a GDR of which they will also own a stake . Their total ownership will be no less than 10 percent , " Rashad said . Rashad said each al - Ahram Beverages share would be equivalent to two GDRs and that it would be priced at an unspecified premium above the share price on the Cairo bourse . Shares were trading late in the session on Thursday at 104 . 65 pounds ( $ 30 . 77 ) . Luxor Group bought 75 percent or 3 . 37 million shares of monopoly al - Ahram Beverages , also known as Pyramids Breweries , from the Egyptian government last year in a deal worth 231 million pounds . The brewery workers own 10 percent and the remaining 15 percent was sold through the Cairo stock exchange . The state had originally offered 20 percent but religious opposition to al - Ahram Beverage ' s Stella beer hit the sale . The state - owned Holding Company for Housing and Tourism has said that the buyers are also committed to invest 221 million pounds . Sources close to the deal said that Danish brewers Carlsberg will technically revamp the firm and that they might even produce beer in Egypt under licence . There has been no official confirmation from Carlsberg . The GDR offering will be the third by an Egyptian firm within a year . Commercial International Bank ( CIB ) was the first to issue GDRs , currently listed in London , and then the state decided to sell part of its stake in Suez Cement via another London - listed GDR . Misr International Bank / MIBANK is also planning a GDR offering soon . - - Miral Fahmy + 202 578 3290 / 1

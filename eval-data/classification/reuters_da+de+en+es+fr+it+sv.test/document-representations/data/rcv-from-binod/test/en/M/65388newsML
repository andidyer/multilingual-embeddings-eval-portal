KB director sees calm Brussels Bel - 20 reweighting . Expectations that Friday ' s re - weighting of shares in Belgium ' s Bel - 20 index will boost bourse volume to the record level in 1988 could prove unfounded , Remi Vermeiren , director at Kredietbank NV , said . " Logically , it should be a non - event . People should really already have taken positions , " Vermeiren , in charge of financial markets , told Reuters . Traded volume has mostly been subdued this week and the index has been confined to a narrow range as investors awaited the outcome of Friday ' s session . Some participants thought that portfolio managers and hedge funds have been holding back from covering their index - related positions until then . The bourse is taking the unusual step of suspending trade briefly on Friday afternoon to smooth out expected price swings alongside the settlement of September futures and options contracts . Vermeiren said the changes taking place were significant , noting KB would see its weight in the Bel - 20 double to 102 from 50 shares . " It ' s been in the market for a long time and people could have anticipated it . A lot of positions in index funds and derivatives have already been adapted , I think , " Vermeiren said . The February 8 , 1988 volume record of 18 . 77 billion francs was set during the battle for control of Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique SA ( SGB ) between Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti and France ' s Cie de Suez . The average daily volume on the bourse in July , before the traditionally quieter August month , was 2 . 7 billion Belgian francs . - - Nick Antonovics , Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6817 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

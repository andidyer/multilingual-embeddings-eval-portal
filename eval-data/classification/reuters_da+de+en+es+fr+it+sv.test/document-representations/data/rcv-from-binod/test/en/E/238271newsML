Germany leaves rates steady , eases reserves . The Bundesbank on Thursday left its key interest rates unchanged but delighted markets with news it was relaxing its reserve policies , a widely anticipated step to make Germany ' s financial market more competitive . After the central bank said it was keeping its discount rate at 2 . 50 percent , the Lombard emergency financing rate at 4 . 50 percent and its main money market rate , or repo , at three percent , it announced a small change over reserves . From January 1 , banks will no longer need to hold a portion of certain funds in non - interest bearing accounts at the central bank , the Bundesbank said . " The exemption of repo business with maturities of up to one year from the minimum reserve will strengthen the efficiency and competitiveness of the German market , " the Bundesbank said in explaining its long - planned step . The market widely welcomed the move but said its impact may be limited as banks receive only partial relief . They still need to hold reserves on short term sight deposits and savings deposits . The requirement was imposed after World War Two in 1948 to bind banks to the central bank for their refunding needs , helping the Bundesbank guide monetary policy more effectively . Commercial banks had long lobbied the Bundesbank to change the regulations in order to breathe new life into Germany ' s barely existing repo market . Hermann Remsperger , chief economist at BHF Bank in Frankfurt said : " I am absolutely delighted . The most important aspect of this move is that such a measure boosts the financial centre of Frankfurt without harming monetary policy . " But money market dealers wondered how much business could actually be brought back as Germany ' s biggest banks appeared to feel quite comfortable conducting their business in London . They agreed , however , the move could make life easier as some German banks may now decide to consolidate their repo desks based in London and Frankfurt . Separately German Finance Minister Theo Waigel applauded the central bank ' s decision , saying it met the demands of monetary policy and " adjusts ( German ) reserve instruments to competitive conditions in international capital markets . " The Bundesbank stressed the decision did not signal a retreat from the concept of holding minimum reserves . It would still push for them to be used by the future European Central Bank . Until now banks have had to hold two percent reserves on repo business and sight deposits and 1 . 5 percent on savings deposits . Under a repo transaction , a dealer borrows funds from an investor by selling securities to him . The dealer repurchases the securities at a later date , thereby repaying the loan . The difference between the sale and repurchase price represents interest on the loan . Economists said that this move had no impact on monetary policy and that the decision to leave rates unchanged was expected as there was no compelling reason to make a change . Deflecting speculation the Bundesbank may prop up Germany ' s sluggish economy with another rate cut , chief spokesman Manfred Koerber earlier this week restated comments that the council saw no need to adjust rates in the short - term . - Frankfurt Newsroom , + 49 69 756525

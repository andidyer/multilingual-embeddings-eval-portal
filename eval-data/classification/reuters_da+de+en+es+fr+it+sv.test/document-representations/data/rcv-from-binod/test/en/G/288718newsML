NYC speaker urges council have more budget clout . The New York City Council Speaker on Monday urged the city charter be revised to expand the council ' s power , including giving it part of the budget authority held by the mayor , who wants to keep his control . Peter Vallone , a Democrat , in his annual " State of the City " address , said the council should have the power to change budget modifications that are proposed by the mayor , He added the council should be able to share the authority to determine revenue estimates , a privilege that now rests with the mayor . The council prepares its own projections of how much the city will collect in taxes but the administration is not obliged to heed them . Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was not slow to voice his opposition to the changes put forth by the speaker . The mayor told City Hall reporters that " It was enormously important to the city " and its credit rating for the mayor to keep the current level of control over the budget . " It would almost create a different kind of government , " Giuliani added , when asked about the speaker ' s proposals . New York City ' s charter was last revised in 1989 because a federal court ruling disbanded the city ' s Board of Estimate , which consisted of the mayor , the comptroller , the city council president , and five borough presidents . The court held that the Board ' s operations violated the principle of one - person , one - vote , and its budgetary powers were transferred to the council , making it a more powerful player in city government . In his speech , Speaker Vallone also proposed a total of $ 65 million of tax reductions for fiscal year 1998 , which starts on July 1 , and the mayor said he supported them . The tax cuts , which would increase in later years , include a $ 25 million reduction in the unincorporated business tax , $ 18 million of energy tax cuts , and a $ 22 million earned income tax credit for the working poor . The speaker also suggested that a sales tax exemption for household necessity be enacted , and Giuliani called a reduction in sales taxes on clothing his highest tax priorty . However , the state legislature must approve any New York City tax reductions except ones that the city imposes on property . ( ( - - Joan Gralla , 212 - 859 - 1654 ) )

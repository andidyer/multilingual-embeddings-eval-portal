Lebanon flares up while Israel , PLO mend fences . Fighting flared in Lebanon on Monday , killing at least nine civilians on Israel ' s only active border frontline , just as Israel mended fences with Palestinians over a suicide attack . Lebanese militiamen led by pro - Israeli commander Antoine Lahd fiercely shelled Lebanon ' s southern port of Sidon , killing six civilians and wounding 36 , many of them seriously , security sources said . Shortly after the shelling of Sidon , six Katyusha rockets struck Jezzine , a Lahd stronghold just outside an Israeli - held occupation zone in south Lebanon , killing a 60 - year - old man , pro - Israeli militia sources said . " We have two heads and parts of bodies in the post - mortem room . Many people came but nobody was able to identify them . We still don ' t know who they belong to , " said a medic at Sidon ' s Ghassan Hamoud hospital . Israel ' s army strongly denied firing the shells and blamed it on Lahd forces around the Jezzine area outside the occupation zone patrolled by Israel and Lahd ' s South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) . " Israel did not , I repeat did not , fire on Sidon today , " Israel ' s chief military spokesman , Briagadier - General Oden Ben - Ami , told reporters . " We are coordinated absolutely with the SLA inside the security zone in Lebanon in the south . The Jezzine area is out of this area . . . out of our responsibility , out of our control , " he said . The attack , the first time Sidon had been shelled since a major Israeli military offensive in April 1996 , was apparently to avenge a roadside bomb explosion hours earlier that blew up a car in which children of a late Lahd aide were travelling in the Jezzine area . SLA and Red Cross sources said the explosion killed two people . Ben - Ami said the blast killed three people , including the 11 - year - old daughter and 17 - year - old son of Lahd ' s late commander in Jezzine , Assad Nasr . He said Hizbollah , the Iranian - backed " Party of God " , carried out the attack . Hizbollah ' s top official in south Lebanon , Nabeel Kawouk , threatened retaliation for the 16 shells that landed in Sidon and its suburbs . The Israeli news agency Itim quoted Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai as saying he regretted the targeting of civilians in Lebanon and would use " all his influence " to halt such attacks . Ben - Ami said the Israeli military would urge Lahd not to violate a ceasefire agreement that ended Israel ' s 1996 offensive with an understanding by the parties to the conflict not to target civilians . Israel and SLA patrol the 15 - km ( nine - mile ) deep border zone inside Lebanon with the declared aim of preventing guerrilla attacks on Israel ' s northern border . In Jerusalem , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to transfer to the Palestinian Authority about a third of the funds frozen by Israel after a double suicide bombing on July 30 , his spokesman said . The decision followed what Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak called " partial cooperation " by the authority in the investigation of the marketplace attack which killed 16 people , including the two bombers . An aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat welcomed the decision , calling it a " positive first step " . The United States , the main Middle East peace broker , also hailed the partial thaw . Israel ' s Treasury said 42 million shekels ( $ 12 million ) would be handed over to the self - rule administration . After the twin bombing , Israel clamped a security closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and froze the funds it owes the Authority under a 1994 economic protocol . Arafat has resisted Israeli pressure to round up suspected militants from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups , as he did in March 1996 after a wave of suicide bombings in Israel . Netanyahu has said he suspects Hamas was behind the market bombing but Arafat reiterated on Monday that it was still not clear who the bombers were or where they came from . Substantive talks between Israel and the PLO have been deadlocked since Israel broke ground in March on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem .

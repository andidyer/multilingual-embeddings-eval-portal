Boeing - McDonnell deal seen " universally positive " . Boeing Co ' s proposed $ 13 . 3 billion acquisition of rival McDonnell Douglas Corp is seen as " universally positive , " Wall Street analysts and arbitrageurs said Monday . " It ' s a great deal for Boeing and a good way out for McDonnell Douglas , " said one arb , who requested anonymity . " Everyone ' s hot on the deal , " said another arb , who also declined to be named . The deal would make Boeing the world ' s largest manufacturer of commercial jets and largest aerospace company . The deal is a better solution for McDonnell Douglas than investing in other companies such as General Motors Corp ' s Hughes Electronics Corp , arbs said . " McDonnell Douglas ' s commercial side is wasting away . . . they would have had to have done something to create critical mass , " one arb said . " But McDonnell Douglas would have been looking to Hughes for all the wrong reasons . " Rockwell International Corp and Raytheon Co would be better partners for Hughes than McDonnell Douglas , arbs said . Anti - trust concerns will cause only minor snags in the Boeing - McDonnell deal , arbitrageurs said . The approval process , however , may take longer than the six months Boeing expects , they said . " The understanding is that they went down to Washington and got a good feeling on this deal . They will see their way through , " one arb said . The only loser in the deal is rival aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie , arbs said . Airbus is a consortium made up of French state - owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale , British Aerospace Plc , Daimler - Benz ' s aerospace unit , and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain . Boeing shares were up 6 - 3 / 4 at 103 - 1 / 2 in early morning trading . McDonnell Douglas gained 12 - 7 / 8 to 64 - 7 / 8 . Some analysts said that while a combined Boeing - McDonnell would be a formidable rival for Airbus , the deal might be the spark the European consortium needs to sharpen its focus . " It may force Europe ( manufacturers ) to consolidate and get their act together . This may be just the thing they need , " said Pierre Chao , an aerospace analyst with Morgan Stanley . Morgan Stanley today re - initiated coverage of Boeing with a strong buy rating . The brokerage firm had been restricted from covering the stock for four months . Before that , it had rated Boeing as outperform . Gruntal & Co today restated its outperform rating on Boeing . In the merger , Boeing will gain McDonnell Douglas ' s engineering and tooling abilities and an expanded fighter plane presence , Gruntal analyst Steven Lewins said . " Boeing will also recapture some key professional staff , he said in a report .

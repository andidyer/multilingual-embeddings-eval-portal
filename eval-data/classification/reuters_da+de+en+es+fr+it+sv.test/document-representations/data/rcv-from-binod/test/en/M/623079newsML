Mark mired as German row takes centre stage . The mark was mired near its intraday lows against other European currencies in late Europe after a row erupted between the Bundesbank and the German government about plans to revalue central bank reserves . German finance minister Theo Waigel indicated the government will pursue the plan in defiance of the Bundesbank , which argues the scheme will undermine the credibility of European economic and monetary union . While Waigel said Germany will make the grade for EMU even without the benefits of revaluation , traders remained sceptical and were wary of buying marks . " There will be a few hiccups like this on the way to EMU , but the whole thing is so politically - driven that the euro is going to happen , " said John Key , global head of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch . " That said , it looks like the Bundesbank will lose out , and that we will get a wider and softer euro than anticipated . " For instance , Italian Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said the German dispute was more likely to " make the starting of EMU easier " as it will make countries " more reasonable " in interpreting the EMU criteria . Mark / Paris stood at 3 . 3786 / 91 at 1411 GMT versus 3 . 3817 / 22 late Wednesday in Europe . The mark was quoted at 989 . 30 / 60 lire and 84 . 64 / 67 pesetas compared to its 994 . 45 and 85 . 00 highs late yesterday . Uncertainty about the outlook for EMU , as well as the second round of French parliamentary elections looming on Sunday , prevented traders piling into other EMS currencies , though . The key beneficiaries were therefore the dollar and sterling , both seen to be immune from EMU turmoil . " People will go for more straightforward currencies like the dollar and the pound until the situation is clarified , " said Tony Norfield , treasury economist at ABN Amro here . Traders were also reluctant to take chances on the lira before the Italian cabinet meets tomorrow to discuss the three - year economic programme which will include details of how the government intends to meet the Maastricht EMU criteria . One of the few currencies to buck the trend of mark softness was the Swedish crown . Mark / Swedish crown rose to a two - week high of 4 . 5420 , only to be met with Riksbank intervention to support the crown at about 4 . 54 , according to traders . The mark traded at 4 . 5350 / 80 at 1413 GMT . Turmoil in the EMS bloc has been less beneficial than usual for the Swiss franc , with traders expecting the Swiss National Bank to step in and combat any rise in its currency . The SNB has pumped liquidity into the money market in the past week , forcing short rates lower and sparking talk of a discount rate cut . Still , the Swiss franc pushed higher in late Europe after the SNB left its discount rate unchanged at 1 . 0 percent at its weekly policy meeting . Mark / Swiss franc was quoted at 82 . 86 / 91 centimes versus 83 . 75 / 80 late yesterday . - - Swaha Pattanaik , London Forex Desk + 44 171 542 6284

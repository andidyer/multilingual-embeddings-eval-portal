Indian Aluminium sees better 2nd half . Indian Aluminium Company Ltd ( Indal ) on Friday said it looked forward to improved financial performance in the second half of 1996 / 97 ( April - March ) . " The management believes that barring unforeseen circumstances , Indal ' s performance in the second half should be substantially better , " it said in a statement issued after announcing a fall in profit in the first half . Indal said its net profit fell to 382 million rupees in the first half of 1996 / 97 from 483 million in the year ago period . " The projects now commissioned and cost reduction measures undertaken are expected to show results in this financial year itself , " Indal said . Power supply at Alupuram smelter improved . " Improvement in international prices of alumina and aluminium , as is widely expected , should also provide better margins on exports of alumina , " Indal hoped . Indal said it is close to finalising arrangements for a captive power plant at Belgaum to be built on build - operate - transfer basis . " This captive power will allow Indal to re - energise 40 , 000 tonnes per annum of idle smelter capacity , " it said . New projects nearing completion include installation of new extruder at Kalwa that would increase the volume of value - added foil products and expansion of standard alumina facilities at Belgaum and Muri plants . " These projects will significantly strengthen the company ' s competitive position , " it said . Indal blamed the first half performance on external factors including a sharp rise in petroleum product prices , power and coal , steep fall in global aluminium prices and near - total power cuts at the smelters in Alupuram and Belgaum . " Also the general slowdown in industrial growth and liquidity tightness sharply decelerated growth in many demand segments , " it said . During the first half sales of sheets rose 8 . 0 percent , foil and packaging 11 percent and chemicals 20 percent , Indal said . The only exception was the extrusion business , which suffered from heavy power cuts at Alupuram , it said . - - Bombay newsroom + 91 - 22 - 265 9000

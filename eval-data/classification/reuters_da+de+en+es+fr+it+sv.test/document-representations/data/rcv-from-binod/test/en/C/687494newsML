Cover " babes " boost sales of UK men ' s magazines . Scantily - clad " babes " are boosting sales of British men ' s magazines , according to a report published on Wednesday by Euromonitor , a market research company . It said sales of men ' s general - interest magazines would reach 80 million pounds ( $ 133 . 4 million ) this year , almost double last year ' s figure , and was expected to shoot up to 176 million pounds by the year 2000 . " The babe on the cover is key to the development of the market , " Euromonitor said . UK - based men ' s magazines were almost non - existent until five years ago when titles mainly focused on cars , football and fishing . But the market for what the publishing industry now calls " lads ' mags " took off with the launch in 1994 of " Loaded " magazine , which is published by IPC . " The parade of semi - nude models , actresses and celebrities has had a very uplifting effect on sales . This trend to middle - shelf porn " proved so successful it was soon copied by others , most notably by FHM Magazine , published by Emap Plc , Euromonitor said . FHM currently has the highest circulation of any UK - based men ' s magazine , with 365 , 000 copies sold a month . Euromonitor said the men ' s magazines , although they were growing rapidly , still had smaller readerships then women ' s magazines , with the leading women ' s title , Prima , selling 565 , 000 copies a month . The average reader of the new crop of men ' s magazines is 26 years old and described by Euromonitor as an upmarket consumer . Euromonitor suggested there was a new niche market for magazines that would target today ' s readers of men ' s magazines - - once they got a bit older and felt out of touch with the " babes and booze " lifestyle promulgated by the existing titles . " There is an obvious gap in the market for a publisher with the right positioning and subject matter , " it said . - - London Advertising Newsdesk + 44 171 542 4770 ( $ = 0 . 599 British Pounds )

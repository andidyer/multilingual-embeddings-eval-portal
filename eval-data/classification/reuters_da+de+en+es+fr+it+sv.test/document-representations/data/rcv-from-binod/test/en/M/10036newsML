Tokyo naphtha dips on crude in slow market . Naphtha prices continued to slide on Thursday due to overnight crude losses in a dull market almost devoid of firm buyers , traders said .

Second - half October open - spec naphtha was assessed bid at $ 193 and offered at $ 194 . First - half November was assessed bid and offered at $ 192 . 25 / $ 193 . 50 . The intra - month spread was assessed at $ 1 . 5 / $ 2 . 5 for first - half October and first - half November . It was assessed at $ 1 / $ 1 . 75 for second - half October and second - half November . Sentiment for jet / kerosene was firm , a fact which some traders partly attributed to reduced runs at three refineries in Singapore . It was notionally assessed discussed at around MOPS plus $ 2 . Traders were still uncertain of the Japanese refineries ' plans for winter stocks , but some believed spot requirements would probably be about the same as the past few years . - - Tokyo Commodities ( 81 - 3 5473 - 3706 )

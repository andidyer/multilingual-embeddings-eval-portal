U . S . judge orders Conrail to hold meeting . U . S . District Court Judge Donald Van Artsdalen issued an injunction to require Conrail Inc . to proceed with a Dec . 23 shareholder meeting to vote on a key provision of the railroad ' s planned $ 8 . 5 billion merger with CSX Corp . Rival bidder Norfolk Southern Corp . , which has offered $ 10 billion in cash for Conrail , last week filed suit against the Philadelphia - based company to force it to hold the meeting . Conrail is seeking shareholder approval to waive a Pennsylvania law that requires an all - cash payment by CSX , which already has bought 19 . 9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer . CSX wants to buy Conrail in a cash and stock transaction . Philadelphia - based Conrail had said it could postpone the meeting if it did not have the votes needed to ensure passage . The order prevents Conrail ' s board from postponing the vote if it did not have enough votes to approve the provision . It would not apply if a material change in circumstances surrounding the deal , such as a new bidder making an offer or an increased offer from Richmond , Va . - based CSX , were to emerge before the meeting . Norfolk Southern , based in Norfolk , Va . , has sought to force the meeting . Conrail said in its proxy materials it would postpone the meeting if it lacked the necessary shareholder votes to approve the provision . Van Artsdalen said it would be unfair to shareholders to deprive them of the right to have their vote counted , on the grounds they were unlikely to approve the deal . " That , as far as I can see , makes practically a sham election , " he said . Conrail General Counsel Bruce Wilson said the company regretted the decision but had not yet decided whether to appeal . Norfolk Southern attorney Steven Rothschild welcomed the ruling as a victory for shareholder rights . " What we have always wanted is for the Conrail stockholders to be given a right , without coercion , to express their view , whatever that view is , " Rothschild said .

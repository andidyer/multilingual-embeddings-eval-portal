SAKU CALM OVER NEW EXCISE TAX . Saku Brewery said on Tuesday that a new higher excise tax will not affect its sales but will have a negative impact on Estonian beer production as a whole . Saku , owned by Baltic Beverages , itself a joint venture between Finnish Hartwall and Nordic brewer Pripps , is the leading beer maker in Estonia . " We think it has no effect ( on sales figures ) , " chairman Cardo Remmel told Reuters . " If the state has divided us into the same category as large enterprises . . . we probably have to set higher goals , " he added . Estonia ' s parliament earlier approved changes to the excise law , which will increase the excise duty for Saku and foreign beer importers by 0 . 50 kroons from July 1 . " Tax allowances make smaller breweries disinterested in growing in order not to pay higher excise tax which lowers their competitivity , " Remmel said . " The positive impact is that some smaller breweries will get more breathing - space , " he added . However , Remmel said he saw a change in tax and competition conditions during the course of a budget year as a danger . " It is in contradiction with promises given to European Union , the World Trade Organisation and foreign investors , " he added . - - Eva Palu , Tallinn newsroom , + 372 630 8400 , reuters @ reuters . ee

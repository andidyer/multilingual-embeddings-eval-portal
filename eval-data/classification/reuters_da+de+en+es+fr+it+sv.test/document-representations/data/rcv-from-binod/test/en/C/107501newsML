U . S . insured losses in Q3 estimated at $ 2 . 23 bln . U . S . insured property losses from catastrophes totaled about $ 2 . 23 billion in the 1996 third quarter , an insurance industry trade group said . That makes it the third costliest third quarter , behind 1992 , when Hurricane Andrew pounded Florida and 1989 when Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina , according to Property Claim Services ( PCS ) , an industry - supported organization that tracks insurance losses . The 1996 third quarter losses resulted from eight catastrophes , including damage from Hurricane Fran , which struck North Carolina on September 5 , PCS said . Insured damage from Hurricane Fran was earlier estimated at about $ 1 . 6 billion . " Our estimate for the 1996 third quarter may increase as we continue to monitor insurer losses from Hurricane Fran , " said Gary Kerney , assistant vice president of PCS . The 1996 third quarter insured loss of $ 2 . 23 billion is up from the roughly $ 1 . 65 billion in losses recorded in the second quarter and slightly less than the $ 2 . 55 billion in insured losses from the first quarter . In the third quarter , 17 states were affected by catastrophes , PCS said . North Carolina sustained the most damage , with an estimated $ 1 . 38 billion from Hurricane Fran ' s wind and flooding . Virginia ranked second among all states with estimated damage of $ 210 million , also largely due to Hurricane Fran . Losses in the 1992 third quarter totaled $ 17 . 43 billion , largely from Hurricane Andrew . Losses in the 1989 third quarter totaled $ 4 . 44 billion , mostly from Hurricane Hugo . - - Patricia Vowinkel 212 - 859 - 1716

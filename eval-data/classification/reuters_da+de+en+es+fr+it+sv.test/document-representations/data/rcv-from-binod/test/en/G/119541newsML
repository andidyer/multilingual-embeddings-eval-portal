SOCCER - BARCELONA SHORT OF GOALKEEPERS AS CUP TIE BECKONS . Barcelona , resigned to losing Brazilian striker Ronaldo for Thursday ' s Cup Winners ' Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade , now have a goalkeeping crisis on their hands . Portuguese international goalkeeper Vitor Baia pulled up in training on Tuesday with a ligament strain in his right knee and is doubtful for the first - leg match at Nou Camp . Second - choice goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui is also injured and on Monday , reserve ' keeper Mariano Angoy quit the club to play American football for the Barcelona Dragons . As a result , 29 - year - old Carlos Busquets is set for an unexpected comeback to Barcelona ' s first team . Busquets was a regular under former manager Johan Cruyff but when Bobby Robson took over at the Catalan giants , bringing Baia with him from Porto , the Spaniard slithered down the ranks into the third team . If he plays on Thursday it will be his first top - level appearance since Robson and Baia arrived in the summer . At the other end of the pitch , Spain striker Juan Pizzi is set to replace Ronaldo , who misses the clash with the Yugoslavs because of a Brazilian friendly which has also deprived holders Paris St Germain and Portugal ' s Benfica of their top marksmen . PSG will be without Leonardo , whose seven goals to date have helped them to build a commanding lead in the French league , for their tricky first - round tie in Turkey against Galatasaray . " We ' ll surely miss him , " the Brazilian ' s fellow midfielder Vincent Guerin said . " But I think we have enough good players to manage without him . " Laurent Fournier will probably move forward into Leonardo ' s attacking midfield role , with Jose Cobos coming into the defence at left back . PSG are expecting a tough clash in Istanbul ' s Ali Sami Yen stadium , in stark contrast to their first - round tie against Vaduz of Liechtenstein , whom they beat 7 - 0 on aggregate . Benfica striker Osmar Donizete - - like Ronaldo , the top scorer in his league - - misses the Portuguese side ' s second - round tie against Lokomotiv Moscow to play for his country . But Benfica coach Paulo Autuori is unfazed , saying : " Someone else will take his place and know what to do . " Fiorentina , winners of the first Cup Winners ' Cup final back in 1961 , are promising great things when they face Sparta Prague in their first leg in Florence . The Italians have taken only five points from their five Serie A games to date but captain Gabriel Batistuta believes his side are about to burst upon an astonished world . " I feel I can make a promise to the fans - - Fiorentina and Batistuta are just about to take off and the worst is behind us now , " the inspirational Argentine forward said . Batistuta missed a penalty in Saturday ' s 0 - 0 home draw with Lazio and says he has a debt to repay to Fiorentina ' s fans . " If we get a penalty against Sparta , I ' ll take it " , he said .

Versace killer suicide leaves unanswered questions . The suicide of Andrew Cunanan , suspected killer of fashion designer Gianni Versace , ended a nationwide manhunt and brought relief to Miami ' s terrified gay community . But it left many questions about his tawdry saga unanswered . Police confirmed on Thursday that Cunanan had killed himself the day before with a shot through the mouth in a houseboat just two miles ( three km ) away from where Versace was gunned down outside his Ocean Drive mansion on July 15 . " I think he was a desperate person with very little room to move about either here or elsewhere in the United States , " Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto told a news conference at the end of a drama - filled 24 hours . An autopsy showed Cunanan , a 27 - year - old gay gigolo who was the only suspect in the Versace killing , shot himself , Barreto said . But he said the Versace homicide case remained open as evidence needed to be processed and many questions answered . One man who might help answer some of them was the owner of the houseboat in Miami Beach ' s affluent Indian Creek neighbourhood , which police surrounded on Wednesday afternoon after a caretaker ' s tip - off . They stormed it several hours later and found Cunanan ' s body in the master bedroom . The FBI had located the owner in Las Vegas , Deputy Director William Esposito told a Washington news conference . He was being cooperative and " probably being interviewed as we speak , " Esposito said . He added that he was unaware whether the owner and Cunanan had a prior relationship . Local media have named him as Torsten Reineck , a German citizen who also owns a gay health club in Las Vegas . German police said on Thursday they believed Reineck might be a fugitive they had been seeking since 1992 . Esposito also said Cunanan contacted an associate right after Versace ' s murder about obtaining false identification and a passport so he could flee the United States . Police had named Cunanan as the only suspect in the murder of Versace , couturier to rock stars and royalty whose friends and admirers worldwide were grief - stricken by his death . Cananan , described by his owm mother as a " high - class prostitute , " was also wanted for four other murders in a cross - country killing spree . Barreto said at a Thursday news conference that Cunanan left no suicide note that would explain why he committed his alleged crimes . The suicide weapon , a . 40 calibre handgun , the same type used in the Versace murder , was still undergoing tests in a police laboratory , Barreto said . Cunanan was identified through a thumbprint on his driver ' s license . Nor was there an answer to whether Cunanan was HIV - positive , a factor which some criminologists have suggested might have fuelled his drive to kill . His exact relationship to Versace is a mystery although the two are reported to have met socially . It took hours for police to positively identify the corpse after the siege just 40 blocks from the murder site . Although the corpse was immediately thought to be Cunanan it took fingerprint experts several hours to make a match . News of Cunanan ' s death brought relief to Miami Beach , a mecca for tourists and for gays , who had lived in fear and anxiety while the suspected killer remained on the loose . " Life can get back to some semblance of normal here , " Patric Chemaly , a 27 - year - old medical student , said . " I think people were afraid to go out . " Miami Beach Mayor Seymour Gelber told Reuters : " We ' re accustomed to greeting tourists , not searching out killers . . . the last 10 days have been rather dreary . " In Milan , the Versace family said they were relieved and grateful to those who helped to resolve the murder . The family of Lee Miglin , one of the other four dead men , echoed those words and extended condolences to other bereaved families . They said Miglin was killed in a random act of violence over an automobile . Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI chief Louis Freeh said his death concluded " one of the most massive fugitive manhunts in American law enforcement history . " Cunanan was on the FBI ' s 10 Most Wanted list of fugitives even before the Versace slaying . He was also wanted for the murders of his friend Jeffrey Trail , 28 , in late April ; his former lover David Madson , 33 , in May ; Miglin , 72 , also in May , and William Reese , 45 , also in May . Versace , 50 , was cremated in Miami last week and the ashes buried in Italy on Friday .

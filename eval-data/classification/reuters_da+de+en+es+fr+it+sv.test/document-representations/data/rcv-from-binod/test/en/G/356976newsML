Brazil lower house elects Cardoso ally as new head . Brazil ' s Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday elected an ally of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso as its next president , boosting the government ' s chances of pushing through reforms , officials said . Congressional officials said more than half the 504 deputies present backed Michel Temer , the lower - house leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) . " I want to thank all deputies , " Temer said in a speech . Temer ' s victory follows the election on Tuesday of Antonio Carlos Magalhaes as president of the Senate . Both outcomes are considered a boost for Cardoso ' s reform programme , including his bid to be allowed to seek a second consecutive term . A constitutional amendment allowing sitting presidents , governors and mayors to seek re - election passed a first vote in the lower house last week . The measure must pass in a second round in the Chamber of Deputies , probably after February 15 , and then win approval in two rounds of voting in the Senate .

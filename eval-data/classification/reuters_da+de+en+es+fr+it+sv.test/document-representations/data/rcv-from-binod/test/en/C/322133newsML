Toyota seeks global prestige with NYSE listing . Japanese car giant Toyota Motor Corp . said Tuesday it wants to polish up its international profile with a renewed push to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange . The company said it hopes to enhance its reputation as a global enterprise by joining 11 other big - name Japanese companies listed on the exchange , including its rival Honda Motor Co . Ltd , the sole carmaker among them . " We ' re positively looking into the possibility , but we have not yet decided anything concrete . We have not set any target year for the move , " a Toyota spokesman said when asked about a report that Toyota is seeking the listing by 2000 . Toyota plans to set up an internal team to deal with the necessary listing procedures , the spokesman said . Despite being Japan ' s biggest car company and the country ' s most profitable firm , Toyota still has something of a " country cousin " reputation and is regarded by some in the industry as a conservative business . Toyota , which is stepping up its business in North America , would be able to diversify its sources of funds for new projects by listing its shares in New York . But Toyota , which has a hefty treasury in the form of cash and deposits worth 2 . 4 trillion yen ( $ 20 . 3 billion ) , said it is seeking global status rather than concrete benefits . " The purpose is to gain a reputation as a ' global corporation ' rather than seeking to raise funds , " said the spokesman . On Tuesday , Toyota President Hiroshi Okuda said in a published interview that the company hopes to list its shares in New York by 2000 to improve its global image . " The issue of disclosure would be difficult , " Okuda said , adding : " We have already reached an internal consensus that doing so is necessary for the purpose of our public relations . We hope to be listed by 2000 . " Toyota would come under strict scrutiny from the U . S . Securities and Exchange Commission and would need to win the body ' s approval for the listing . On Tuesday , Toyota ' s shares rose 40 yen to 3 , 200 yen ( $ 27 ) while the key Nikkei market average suffered a moderate fall . Blue - chips such as Toyota have stayed strong despite the overall gloom gripping the Tokyo stock market .

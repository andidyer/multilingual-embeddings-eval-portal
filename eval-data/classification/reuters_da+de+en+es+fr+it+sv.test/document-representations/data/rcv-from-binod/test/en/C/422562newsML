ABN AMRO sees SFB buy completed mid - 1997 . Dutch bank ABN AMRO said on Wednesday it hoped its $ 1 . 9 billion acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp would be completed by mid - 1997 . The Wall Street Journal newspaper earlier reported that the U . S . Federal Reserve Board had delayed a decision on the purchase to mid - April from next week because of a complaint that the Dutch bank had defrauded American investors in a corporate bond issue . ABN AMRO spokesman Theo van Dijk said ABN AMRO did not expect an " unusual delay " in consideration of the takeover , its biggest to date . " It ' s normal at this stage . There ' s nothing to worry about , " he told Reuters . " We hope we will be able to follow the ( normal ) timetable and that the acquisition will be completed more or less by the middle of 1997 . " The Wall Street Journal said the delay was sparked by a complaint from a U . S . investor who invested in a bond issue by Dutch truck maker DAF NV , which was underwritten by ABN AMRO . Investors lost money as the prices of the bonds plunged when DAF went bankrupt in 1993 . DAF was later resurrected and sold . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

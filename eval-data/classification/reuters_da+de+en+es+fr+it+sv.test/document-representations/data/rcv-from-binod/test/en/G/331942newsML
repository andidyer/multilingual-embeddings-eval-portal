Congressman urges U . S . effort on East Timor . A U . S . congressman who recently visited East Timor urged the Clinton administration on Thursday to take the lead in tackling human rights abuses on the Indonesian - controlled island . Highlighting reports of torture and killings , Representative Frank Wolf suggested Washington send a high level envoy like Gen . Colin Powell , the former chairman of the U . S . Joint Chiefs of Staff , to discuss the situation with Indonesian officials . " It is time for the administration to actively search for solutions to human rights problems in East Timor , " Wolf said at a news conference . Wolf , a Virginia Republican , visited East Timor from Jan . 12 - 14 and also met with Indonesian officials in Jakarta . " East Timor is at the bottom of the scale on human rights , " Wolf said . " No one goes out after dark . " He said many of the people he met in East Timor were afraid to talk to him but some told of killings , torture , beatings and disappearances carried out by Indonesian military and police . Wolf also suggested that President Bill Clinton meet with Nobel Peace Prize - winning Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo when he visits the United States later this year . Belo won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize along with exiled resistance leader Jose Ramos - Horta for their efforts to resolve the conflict in the former Portuguese colony . Indonesia took control of East Timor in 1975 , but the United Nations has never recognised the takeover . Wolf said the United States should use its influence and good relations with Indonesia to help ease tensions in East Timor . He said Washington should work with the United Nations , Portugal and Germany , which also has close ties with Jakarta . " It ' s just the right thing to do , " Wolf said . He questioned whether campaign contributions from Indonesian companies and individuals to Clinton and the Democratic Party may have influenced U . S . policy on Indonesia and East Timor , but said he did not know if this was true .

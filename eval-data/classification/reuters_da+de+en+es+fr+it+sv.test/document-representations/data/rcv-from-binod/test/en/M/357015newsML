FEATURE - Colombia stocks rally just a blip on radar . A spectacular rally in stocks in early January made Colombia one of the world ' s best - performing markets and raised fleeting hopes that it was finally getting its act together again after 2 - 1 / 2 years of political crisis . But the rally , which saw a 22 percent gain in share prices over the first 10 trading days of the year , faded quickly . And it now appears to have been little more than a blip on the radar screen of investors in a country whose long tradition of prudent economic policy has come to a screeching halt . President Ernesto Samper , who has been hit with fresh calls for his resignation since mid - January , insisted in a television address on January 27 that " the economy is looking good " and that Colombians have every reason to be optimistic about the New Year . But Samper , whose credibility was damaged even before he took office amid a growing drugs scandal in August 1994 , has had to bend over backwards to explain why he declared a state of economic emergency on January 13 if things were really looking up . There are many reasons , in a country torn by chaos and general mayhem , to believe he may be overly optimistic . U . S . CERTIFICATION AND THREAT OF SANCTIONSA leading cause of uncertainty in Colombia , and what Samper himself has described as " collective hysteria , " is the fact that U . S . President Bill Clinton must decide by March 1 whether it should remain on a list of virtual pariah states that have failed to participate actively enough in the anti - drug fight . So - called " decertification " for a second consecutive year could trigger punitive economic sanctions that Clinton fell short of imposing last year . In addition to increased tariffs on Colombian exports to the United States , Clinton could invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose a wide variety of sanctions , including the suspension of banking services between the United States and Colombia . Most business leaders consulted by Reuters see decertification as a certainty after a judge ' s January 17 lenient sentencing of two of the world ' s most powerful drug lords . The two , the same men accused of pouring millions of drug dollars into Samper ' s campaign , may walk free in as little as five years . Businessmen are divided on the prospects of U . S . sanctions on Colombia , but Bogota - based diplomats say Washington may have little choice . " Without sanctions they ( the U . S . ) will have shown that the whole certification process has no teeth , " one said . ECONOMIC EMERGENCYMeasures decreed as part of the emergency that Samper surprised the nation with on January 13 include a six percent tax on new foreign loans and a de facto increase in Colombia ' s capital gains tax - - which could ravage the stock market . Some economic analysts have said the measures , including a $ 1 . 2 billion budget cut and an overall expansion of the tax base , were long overdue and would ultimately gain favour with foreign investors . But they have been widely criticised by importers , who finance much of their business with foreign credits , and prompted the country ' s leading business group to boycott a new wage - and - price control agreement with the government . Eighteen of 20 leading economists surveyed by Bogota ' s El Espectador daily said the emergency measures would do nothing to reactivate the economy and 16 said they were " recessionary " . The measures are aimed ostensibly at narrowing the central government ' s yawning budget deficit and pushing Colombia ' s over valued peso currency lower against the dollar . EMERGENCY WITHIN THE EMERGENCY ? Adding to uncertainty is that Colombia ' s constitutional court has 90 days , from the day the emergency measures were announced , to overturn them if it rules they were unjustified . The government has said a huge increase in the inflow of foreign capital late last year more than warranted the measures . The inflow forced the central bank to buy large amounts of dollars to prevent the peso - - which appreciated by 16 percent against the dollar in real terms ( net of inflation ) last year - - from crashing through the lower end of its exchange rate band . Exporters led by the powerful National Coffee Growers ' Federation insisted on a peso devaluation last year , since its strengthening eroded the real value of export revenues . Critics argued much of the increase in foreign capital was due to a last - minute flood of privatisation revenues , however , so the government has no one to blame but itself . If the economic emergency plan is ruled unconstitutional , Samper has warned he may eliminate up to 350 , 000 state jobs . LABOUR UNREST LEADS TO STRIKEEven before the economic emergency was announced , the government said it planned to hold public sector workers to an average wage hike of no more than 13 . 5 percent this year , despite inflation of more than 21 percent in 1996 . This , in turn , led unions representing about 800 , 000 workers to set a February 11 deadline for a nationwide and indefinite work stoppage . Some press commentators say the strike could be the worst since September 1977 when public unrest erupted in a violent work stoppage that left 20 people dead in Bogota . ELECTORAL ENGINES ARE WARMING UPFurther adding to gnawing uncertainty is the fact that 1997 marks Samper ' s last full year in office and , in his own words , " the electoral engines are warming up now . " Polls show the front - runner to succeed Samper , when he steps down in August 1998 , to be chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso , an anti - drug crusader and key U . S . ally . If Valdivieso doesn ' t run , Interior Minister Horacio Serpa would be the front - runner . Serpa , Samper ' s right - hand man , has had repeated rows with the United States . U . S . officials secretly hope Valdivieso - - who is investigating charges that Serpa knew about and helped cover up illegal campaign financing - - will ultimately send him to jail .

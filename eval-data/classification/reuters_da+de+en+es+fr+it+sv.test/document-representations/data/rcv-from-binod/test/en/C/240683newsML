Prism seals WAGN franchise , eyes rights . Prism Rail Plc , a company specifically formed to tender for passenger rail services being privatised in Britain , confirmed on Friday it had been awarded the West Anglia / Great Northern ( WAGN ) rail franchise . It expected to have to raise some of the capital required by way of a rights issue , the group said . It also noted in a statement that although the franchise had been awarded on a standard seven - year term , it could be terminated by the government regulator after five and a half years if other rail projects made this necessary . " The capital requirement laid down by the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising ( Opraf ) is 19 million stg which will be partly funded out of the proceeds of a proposed rights issue with the balance being met out of bank facilities , " Prism said in a statement . Further details would be announced in due course with a circular to shareholders , it added . WAGN ' s weekday service operates approximately 940 passenger train services , providing about 150 , 000 passenger journeys per day to destinations to the east and northeast of London . Prism said its board considered WAGN an attractive franchise " because it has a stable customer base and cashflow receipts deriving from a high proportion of season ticket sales ; a healthy and developing off - peak business and , in particular , a growth business to and from both Stansted Airport and Cambridge , which are marketed as a discrete brand " . The initial statement gave no detailed explanation of why Opraf had the right to terminate the franchise after 5 - 1 / 2 years except to say it depended on completion of the planned Thameslink 2000 upgrade project . The Thameslink franchise has yet to be awarded . In the first complete year of the WAGN franchise , commencing April 1 , 1997 , the subsidy paid to Prism is expected to amount to 52 . 9 million stg , at current prices . " The level of support payments will reduce significantly in later years , such that by the end of the franchise , Prism will be making payments to Opraf , " the company added . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

Minn . bill would hike bond cap for water projects . A bill pending before a Minnesota Senate committee would increase by $ 400 million the bonding authority of the state ' s Public Facilities Authority for water projects . State Sen . Dennis Frederickson , R - New Ulm , the bill ' s sponsor , said Monday the measure would allow the authority to issue $ 200 million of additional revenue bonds for local waste water treatments projects under an existing revolving loan fund program . The bill would also authorize the first $ 200 million of revenue bond issuance for a new local drinking water revolving loan fund program , he said . The bill would increase the Public Facilities Authority ' s total bond cap to $ 850 million , although Frederickson said lawmakers may ultimately adjust the final number after scrutinizing the projects the bonds would fund . Frederickson said he expects the measure , which has the support of Gov . Arne Carlson , to pass .

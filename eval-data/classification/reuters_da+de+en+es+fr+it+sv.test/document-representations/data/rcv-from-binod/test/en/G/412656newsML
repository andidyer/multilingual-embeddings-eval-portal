RUGBY UNION - FRANCE STUN ENGLAND , CLOSE IN ON TITLE . France pulled off one of the great escapes in Twickenham history on Saturday to beat England 23 - 20 and wrap one arm around this season ' s Five Nations trophy . Trailing 20 - 6 heading into the last 20 minutes against an England side looking totally in control , the French dug deep into their repertoire to conjure two converted tries and a final match - clinching penalty from hero - of - the - hour Christophe Lamaison . The Brive centre scored 18 points in total , including a try , to ensure his side ' s first win at Twickenham since 1987 and give them an outstanding opportunity to clinch a grand slam at home to Scotland in a fortnight . England , who had blown apart the Scots and Irish in the last 20 minutes of their previous matches , must now travel to Cardiff to face Wales with their world suddenly turned upside down . Coach Jack Rowell and ex - captain Will Carling had hinted beforehand this could be their final match at Twickenham in their respective roles , but neither will surely want to depart on such a disappointing note . " It was the worst 20 minutes of my life , " admitted Rowell . " In the first half we didn ' t let them play , but it ' s all about mental and physical stamina . " Even the French , who performed a joyous lap of honour pursued by their supporters , could not quite believe what had happened . Until Laurent Leflamand successfully pursued a chip by Alain Penaud in the 62nd minute to drag their side back into contention , there seemed no way England would let their hard - earned advantage slip . On the sort of gusty afternoon which both goalkickers must have dreaded , England fly - half Paul Grayson had confounded everyone by landing three well - struck penalties inside the first 11 minutes to give his side a 9 - 3 lead after Lamaison had opened the scoring in the third minute . The visitors , playing with the wind , would have wished for at least a 10 - point cushion at the interval , but they found it almost impossible to force their way into dangerous territory . Strong English defence , a shortage of line - out ball and the whistle of Scottish referee Jim Fleming caused an increasing amount of Gallic frustration and worse was to follow just before half - time . Fleming allowed play to continue following a French offside and Lawrence Dallaglio burst on to a short pass from Phil de Glanville to storm 35 metres to the line for his third international try . A 14 - 6 lead was extended further by a drop - goal and a fourth penalty from Grayson early in the second - half , leaving France with the rugby equivalent of scaling the Eiger . Somehow they managed it without captain Abdel Benazzi , forced off through injury with France still trailing 20 - 13 and Lamaison , in particular , will not have to buy a drink for years . He took Penaud ' s short pass superbly to dummy his way over in the 70th minute and kept his nerve to slot both the conversion and the all - important penalty , awarded against Dallaglio in a ruck close to the English line . England flung themselves desperately into attack , but the French held firm and should now clinch their first grand slam for a decade .

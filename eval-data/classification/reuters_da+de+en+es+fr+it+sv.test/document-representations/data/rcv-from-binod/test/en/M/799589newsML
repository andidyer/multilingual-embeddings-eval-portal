Petroperu issues tender to buy 380 , 000 bbls crude . Peruvian state oil company Petroperu issued a tender to buy 380 , 000 barrels of crude oil for October 8 - 10 arrival , trade sources said on Thursday . Offers are due August 19 , with a decision slated for August 20 . Possible candidates listed are Colombia ' s Caqo Limsn , South Blend , Vasconia and Cusiana grades , Venezuela ' s Mesa , Lagotreco and Guafita , Ecuador ' s Oriente , Peru ' s Lote 8 , Mexico ' s Isthmus , and Argentina ' s Medanito , Rincon and Escalante . Interestingly , Petroperu recently bought Lote 8 crude in another crude tender issued in early August for August 29 - 31 arrival at the Talara refinery . The company infrequently issues such tenders since the privatization of the La Pampilla refinery last year . A South American trader speculated that the company was seeking to generate competition between domestic and imported crudes before inking a possible term deal , although this could not be immediately confirmed . - - Patricia Garip - Bertuol NY Energy Desk ( ( + 1 212 859 1620 ) )

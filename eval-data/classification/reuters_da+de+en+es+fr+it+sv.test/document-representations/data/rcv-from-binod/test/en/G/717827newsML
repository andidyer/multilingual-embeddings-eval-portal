Singapore flies citizens , foreigners from Cambodia . Singapore evacuated several hundred of its citizens and foreigners from Cambodia in four military planes on Wednesday , and two more flights were scheduled for later in the day . Four air force C - 130 aircraft carrying evacuees landed at a military base around midday . Two additional return trips would be made by early evening , a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman told Reuters . " This exercise was in response to requests from Singaporeans who were stranded with their families in Cambodia and who wanted to leave Phnom Penh , " a joint statement from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier . Some non - Singaporeans were also on the flights , among them the family of Brunei ' s ambassador and other Bruneians . " I feel safe and happy , " said Ahjah Aminah , the ambassador ' s wife , adding she was worried for her husband but glad her three children had been evacuated . The ambassador and two members of the embassy staff were still in Cambodia , Hussin Sulaiman , Brunei ' s high commissioner in Singapore , told Reuters . Families and several children were among the evacuees . Mah Yeow Beng , his wife Elaine Mah , both missionaries , and their two children were among 100 Singaporeans who took refuge on Sunday at the Sofitel Cambodiana Hotel in Phnom Penh after heavy fighting broke out over the weekend between forces loyal to the country ' s rival co - premiers . " We were out and had to rush home to get our kids before making our way to the hotel , " Mah said . " There were roadblocks and soldiers on the streets , including a convoy of tanks . We might have been stopped . " Several Cambodian wives of Singapore workers made the flight out of Cambodia . Chan Monyrath , a flight attendant for Silk Air and seven months pregnant , sighed with relief on landing in Singapore . " I did not have trouble leaving because of my husband . My family are still in Cambodia . I think it is safer now but I ' m worried , " Chan said . Others managed to escape from Phnom Penh , but left family members behind . Sophia Ismail , a Singaporean , left with her seven - month old baby Oum Val , but not the baby ' s French - Cambodian father . She said there had been rumours of tension within the capital about a month before fighting actually broke out . " We stocked up and kept lots of food , but there was no time to have them . "

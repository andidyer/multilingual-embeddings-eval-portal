Austria chancellor takes over as head of state . Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky began his first full day as acting head of state on Tuesday while doctors sought to pin down the exact illness troubling sick President Thomas Klestil . Klestil , who regained consciousness on Monday after spending three days sedated and on an artificial respirator , was able to ask the chancellor to perform his largely ceremonial duties for the next week . News that the president had been unconscious since Friday came as a surprise to the media and political commentators , and opened a debate over the right of voters to be kept informed of the health of top politicians running the country . There was no suggestion that Klestil ' s incapacity came near matching the international significance and concern over the heart problems besetting Russian President Boris Yeltsin . But undue secrecy over the state of health of a nation ' s leaders was not good for democracy , newspapers said . Respected Austrian daily Der Standard said that , when leaders were ill , their office should issue daily bulletins on their state of health . " Anything else leads to wild rumours and to crowds of journalists hanging around hospitals trying to get hold of any authentic report , " the paper said in a commentary . " Secretiveness . . . reminds one more of a communist system than a democratic one , although a sick Boris Yeltsin in the middle of his presidential campaign is understandably a lot more problematic than an Austrian president half way through his term of office " it added . Former French president Francois Mitterrand , who died in January , acknowledged he had cancer after a prostate operation in 1992 but his personal physician disclosed in a book that the president had covered up his illness for a decade . Klestil , 63 , who separated from his wife in 1994 after revealing he was having an affair , was admitted to Vienna General Hospital on September 13 and transferred to intensive care last Friday . Doctors said Klestil was suffering from an aggressive and atypical form of pneumonia but they were still investigating the nature of his lung inflammation . They said no cancer was found and the illness was not life - threatening . Under the constitution , the chancellor assumes the duties of president for 20 days , after which responsibilities pass , in turn , to the three presidents of parliament . One of the presidents , Wilhelm Brauneder , belongs to the far - right Freedom Party but political sources said a fresh presidential election would probably be called before he could temporarily adopt the head of state ' s mantle .

Ambroveneto rises again on Cariplo talk . Italy ' s Banco Ambrosiano Veneto rose further on Friday on continued talk that Italy ' s largest savings bank Cariplo may subscribe to a capital increase planned by Ambroveneto for later this year . Ambroveneto shares were up 1 . 51 percent at 4 , 425 lire by 0900 GMT after a 6 . 61 percent rise on Thursday which came after the bank ' s deputy chairman declined to comment on the question of whether Cariplo planned to subscribe to its planned capital increase . Dealers said that the Italian stock market is currently awash with talk of banks merging , but a Ambroveneto - Cariplo link - up appears one of the most likely . Italian newspaper reports have suggested Cariplo wants to see a strategic link - up with Ambroveneto , and dealers believe Cariplo will look to subscribe to the capital increase as a move to link the two banks . Milan - based Cariplo has said it would start its own process for privatisation in 1997 , while Ambroveneto said last month it intended to make a capital issue of " major dimensions " by the end of year . - - Milan newsroom + 392 66129502

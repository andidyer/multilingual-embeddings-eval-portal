Brussels , Antwerp bourses study closer cooperation . The boards of stock exchanges in Brussels and Antwerp will study proposals for closer cooperation on Thursday , the two bourses said . Brussels bourse deputy director Anne Vleminckx told Reuters that the boards will look into joint marketing efforts and the possibility of moving what little share trading is left in Antwerp to Brussels . Asked to confirm reports in Belgian media that the bourses were considering a full legal merger , Vleminckx said : " There is no such proposal on the table , but if both sides are willing , this cannot be ruled out . " " The Antwerp bourse has done its task . Fundamentally , we are moving in the direction of a merger of the Antwerp bourse into the Brussels bourse , " Antwerp bourse chairman Marc Corluy told Reuters . A full merger could mean the closing of the Antwerp bourse , the oldest bourse in the world . The Antwerp exchange building was built in 1531 and was the first public building exclusively built for financial and commodity trading . It served as a model for the London Stock Exchange building in the late 16th century and for the Amsterdam bourse , which was built in 1611 . Trade in Antwerp is limited to a few small local shares and to a weekly secondary market in bank savings certificates . Its market capitalisation is just 15 billion francs , compared to more than 3 , 000 billion for the Brussels bourse . The regional bourses of Ghent and Liege were closed down in a national stock market reform in the early 1990s . - - Geert De Clercq , Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6813 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

U . S . March S & P 500 futures end up after late rally . U . S . March Standard and Poor ' s 500 futures ran to a fresh record high and finished not far from there , encouraged by late buying amid light trade . " It doesn ' t take much in this market , " one S & P 500 futures trader said . March S & P 500s surpassed resistance at the old record of 817 . 45 set overnight Friday and climbed as high as 819 . 50 in the last 15 minutes of trading . Traders said light afternoon buying amid quiet volume triggered technical bullishness that helped the move . Traders said many bulls hold upside targets at 820 . 00 to 825 . 00 , and the late buying after an early soft tone rekindled those objectives . " They rally in the afternoon , " the trader said . " They do nothing all day and then they seem to rally in the afternoon . " Indeed , trading was very quiet for much of the session as players watched a sluggish tone in Treasury bonds . There was a dearth of significant fundamental data Tuesday and a sense of lethargy after the three - day Presidents Day holiday weekend , several traders said . But once Treasury bond futures closed and small dealer buying materialized , " they definitely turned very friendly again , " another trader said . As for upside targets at 820 . 00 to 825 . 00 , " at this rate you could be there tomorrow , " the trader said . If bonds should rally on Wednesday ' s lineup of economic data , March S & Ps are set to continue their string of records , some said . Still , another trader noted that resistance lurks at 821 . 50 and 822 . 00 . " If you get a big number tomorrow , everything could change , " he said .

Revco ' s first - quarter profits soar . Revco D . S . , Inc . , which has launched a hostile takeover bid for rival drug store chain Big B Inc . , said Tuesday its first - quarter profits soared 71 . 4 percent as sales improved and operating costs declined . Revco , the nation ' s second - largest chain of drug stores , said its profits jumped to $ 14 . 4 million , or 21 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug . 24 , from $ 8 . 4 million , or 13 cents a share , in the year - ago period . Sales rose 9 . 6 percent to $ 1 . 18 billion from $ 1 . 08 billion . Comparable store sales , or sales from stores open at least a year , increased 7 . 9 percent . " Our comparable store sales increases remain strong and we continue to leverage operating expenses with a sustained focus on operating efficiencies , " said D . Dwayne Hoven , Revco ' s chief executive officer . " Our strong operating performance , coupled with the benefit of lower interest expense from reduced debt levels , yielded a very strong first quarter relative to last year ' s results and positions the company to deliver a record performance in fiscal 1997 . " Revco ' s operating profit rose 22 . 3 percent to $ 37 . 9 million from $ 31 . 0 million in the 1995 first quarter . While gross profit margins fell because of continued pressure from managed care sales , this was more than offset by cuts in the Twinsburg , Ohio - based company ' s operating costs . Analysts said strong cost control was the big story . " ( The key was ) very good control of . . . expense , " said Philip Muldoon of McDonald & Co . , a Cleveland brokerage . J . P . Morgan Securities analyst Mark Husson was also impressed with expense control and said Revco had awakened from several " somnabulent " months while a proposed merger with the No . 1 chain , Rite Aid Corp . , was pending . Federal regulatory antitrust concerns derailed that merger earlier this year . " I think this is an aggressive business now . It ' s doing a lot of good work inside itself so it ' s not just an acquisition - driven business . This is a real live one , " he said . He rates the stock a buy . Excluding a non - cash charge for amortization of goodwill , Revco had net income of $ 20 . 7 million , or 31 cents a share , in the first quarter , up from $ 14 . 7 million , or 22 cents a share , in the year - ago period . On Monday , Big B rejected Revco ' s $ 332 million takeover bid as inadequate and said it had already received inquiries from other unidentified suitors . However , Revco said it remains committed to its offer to acquire Big B , which has adopted a shareholder rights plan that would make the deal more difficult to complete . Revco , which owns 5 . 4 percent of Big B ' s stock , said it will review the terms of the Bessemer , Ala . - based drug store chain ' s rights plan and determine what actions to take . During the quarter , Revco opened 43 new stores , 20 of which were relocations and five were acquired stores . It closed five stores . Revco operates more than 2 , 200 stores in 14 Midwestern , Southeastern and Eastern states . Revco ' s stock rose $ 1 to $ 26 . 75 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading .

Israeli programme to cut duties on food delayed . Israel has not implemented the latest phase of a programme to liberalise processed - food imports on January 1 as scheduled , a Treasury spokesman said on Monday . Under the phased - in programme , duties on processed foods were due to fall by one - seventh on January 1 . But the spokesman said the committee in charge of setting the exact terms had not completed them . He said he did not know when the new , lower duties would go into effect . The next phase of the liberalisation will also need cabinet approval .

In addition , Israel undertook unilaterally to lower customs over seven years . The liberalisation covers all processed foods except bakery goods , coffee and chocolates and is aimed at bringing the base customs rate to eight percent in the year 2002 . - Jerusalem newsroom , 972 - 2 - 537 - 0502

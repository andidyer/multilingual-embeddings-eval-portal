Key U . S . economic gauge signals steady , slower growth . A key gauge of future economic activity was flat in June , the Conference Board said on Tuesday in a report suggesting a moderate pace of growth ahead . The private business research group said its Index of Leading Indicators , designed to forecast trends six to nine months ahead , had risen 0 . 3 percent in May after falling 0 . 1 percent in April . The index climbed steadily in each month through the first quarter as the economic pace accelerated at the start of the year before leveling off in the second quarter . Analysts said the June leading index was consistent with that pattern of slowing , but continuing , growth after a fast start at the beginning of the year . They added that it likely would help reassure Federal Reserve policy - makers that inflation was contained , at least in the short run . Five out of the 10 separate measures of economic activity in the index strengthened in June , while five were weaker than in May . " Its basic message is that expansion remains in place and it ' s widespread , though it doesn ' t appear to be as vigorous as it was at times in the past , " said Robert Dederick , economic consultant to Northern Trust Co . in Chicago . The Conference Board said the strongest negative influences in June came from higher initial claims for state unemployment benefits and a shorter average factory workweek . In addition , interest rates were less favourable , new applications for building permits were fewer and delivery times sped up for finished goods - - a sign that factories were not as busy as in May . The positive influences on the June index came primarily from a soaring stock market and stronger money supply . In addition , orders were up for consumer and capital goods and consumer expectations were stronger in June . The National Association of Purchasing Management reported last Friday that its index of nationwide industrial activity rose in July to 58 . 6 percent from 55 . 7 percent in June . It also showed prices for several commodities were higher , which rattled markets at the end of the week . Still , Dederick said financial markets seemed to have steadied after deciding the NAPM index was not unduly threatening , and said it was unlikely the June leading index would have a strong influence . " The fact that it shows the economy is not moving ahead as vigorously is in line with what the Fed wanted , " he said . " So the implication is that there is no need for the Fed to do anything on Aug . 19 . " The central bank ' s Federal Open Market Committee next meets on Aug . 19 to consider interest - rate strategy . A survey by Reuters of 33 economists found that none expected the central bank to boost rates this month because inflation was low and growth healthy . But two - thirds thought the Fed would have to tighten credit at least once before year - end . Last week the Commerce Department said gross domestic product , or GDP , slowed to a 2 . 2 percent rate of advance in the second quarter from 4 . 9 percent in the first quarter . Most economists look for growth around a 3 percent annual rate in the second half , but with a risk toward faster expansion if consumer spending bounces back from a second - quarter slowdown . They say that is a possibility in view of continuing strong job growth and the high level of consumer confidence .

World Bank halts $ 250 mln loan to India power firm . The World Bank has suspended a loan of around $ 250 million to the Maharashtra State Electricty Board ( MSEB ) because of dissatisfaction with the power supplier ' s financial performance , the Maharashtra state government said . " The state government and the MSEB have made all possible efforts to improve its financial health in the given situation and constraints . However , despite all these efforts , the World Bank has informed us of the suspension of disbursement until full compliance is achieved , " said a state government news release issued over the weekend . The World Bank has already disbursed around $ 100 million of a $ 350 million loan earmarked for an investment programme with the MSEB . But the MSEB has failed to generate a 4 . 5 percent rate of return in its electricity operations required to fund its own contribution to the programme . The MSEB ' s failure to meet its financial obligations has forced it to turn to the Maharashtra state government for help , but funds made available by the state were insufficient to cover the MSEB shortfall . World Bank President James Wolfensohn discussed the issue with state government officials during a visit to Bombay two weeks ago . The MSEB raised electricity tariffs 17 . 3 percent this year in a bid to achieve the 4 . 5 percent rate of return , but the World Bank felt the increase was insufficient , the state government press release said . The state government was opposed to raising tariffs further this year , it said . The press release also said " the State Government is confident that with the steps already taken and proposed to be taken the suspension of disbursement of the loan will be reviewed and revoked by the World Bank . " The state government also plans to meet with Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda and Finance Minister P . Chidambaram to enlist their help in getting the World Bank to free up the remainder of the loan . The World Bank has a second loan out to the MSEB for around $ 100 million which will be closed by the end of the year . That loan will remain unaffected , a source close to the matter said . Current World Bank loans to India , through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association , total just over two billion dollars .

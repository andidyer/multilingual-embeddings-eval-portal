Costain sees improvement in H2 performance . Costain Group , the builder which narrowly escaped the threat of administrative receivership this summer , reported a wider loss of 19 . 2 million for the first half on Wednesday , but predicted an improvement in the second half . The group said that despite the loss rising to 19 . 2 million stg from 10 . 4 million last year , it expected turnover and profits to move ahead in the second half . It added that the recent refinancing had strengthened its balance sheet , putting it in a better position for new projects . The group , which has paid no dividend in light of its string of loss - making results , said its new financial security meant it could bid for longer - term projects . It cited other factors for its second - half optimism . " These include an increase in turnover - and a resulting increase in profits - from work already in the orderbook ; a reduction in interest charges , reduced losses in the Middle East and the absence of future losses from land and Marine Engineering . " Last week the group was appointed by Intria , its biggest investor , to manage a feasibility study for the Third Penang Crossing project . It predicts more work from Intria soon . The order book is up 15 percent to 636 million stg from 553 million stg at the close of last year , showing an improvement in the quality of work and profit margins . Sales in the first half , however , showed a deterioration , falling to 360 million stg from 458 million stg . Costain said the figures were in line with expectations at the time of its restructuring . Allan Lovell , the chief executive who had faced calls to resign from some investors this summer , said " we view the medium to long term with renewed confidence . " He said the disposal programme was now complete , apart from the key U . S . Coal unit which remains unsold . Looking at a sectoral breakdown of the results , engineering and construction made a loss of five million stg , down from its 2 . 1 million loss , on turnover of 251 million versus 319 million . U . S . Coal reported a loss of 2 . 8 million stg versus a profit of 700 , 000 as sales fell to 5 . 2 million tons from 5 . 7 million tons . Property saw a loss of 2 . 4 million , down from 1 . 4 million . Net borrowings for the group stood at 101 . 3 million on June 30 . But after taking account of the 73 million refinancing proceeds , pro - forma debt was cut to 28 million . Costain ' s recent financial rescue plan gave a 40 percent stake to a new investor , Intria of Malaysia , and raised 73 million in new capital from this source as well as existing investors . Lovell had told investors the alternative to giving it more cash was administrative receivership . - - London newsroom + 44 171 5427717

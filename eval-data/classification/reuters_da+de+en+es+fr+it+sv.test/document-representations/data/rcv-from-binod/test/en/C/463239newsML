Menem decrees post sell - off , mulls airport decree . Argentine President Carlos Menem signed Monday a decree to privatize state post office ENCOTESA , a sell - off tainted by allegations of " mafia " threats and protested by the political opposition . Cabinet Chief Jorge Rodriguez said Menem was considering using his powers of decree to sell a concession to operate the country ' s airports , another sell - off due this year . The text of the post decree , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters , says the aim is " to have postal and telegraphic services of a standard comparable with qualified postal operators in the world " and with accessible prices . The privatization project , set out in a separate document obtained by Reuters last week , fixes a 30 - year concession and a minimum investment in postal services of $ 25 million a year . Bidders must have assets of $ 100 , 000 and the technical support of the official post office of a member country of the Universal Postal Union . Existing employees of ENCOTESA would have a 14 percent stake in the concessionary company . Paving the way for a " considerable reduction in prices of basic universal services " , the decree rules that simple 20g letters cannot cost more than the $ 0 . 75 currently charged by ENCOTESA and must be revised downwards every three years . The draft project stipulated that that price would have to fall by $ 0 . 05 a year reaching $ 0 . 50 by the year 2002 . The text of the decree also mentions the aim of ensuring a " de - monopolized market open to competition " - - a point which has made the privatization of ENCOTESA a political hot potato and delayed its path through Congress . Former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has accused postal tycoon Alfredo Yabran , a secretive businessman with a large but undisclosed share in the deregulated postal industry , of aiming to build a private postal monopoly for criminal ends . Yabran broke his media silence last week to refute the charges and say he is pulling out of the postal business and now owns just 10 percent of a private postal firm . Yabran complained Cavallo had forced the inclusion of an " anti - Yabran clause " in the postal project . This was denied Monday by Menem ' s Chief of Staff Alberto Kohan , who said : " There is no clause to favor nor to exclude anybody . " Cavallo also warns Yabran ' s business interests in airport bonded warehouses and duty - free put that privatization project at the mercy of " mafias " as well . The official in charge of the airport sale told Reuters last week that a scaled - down plan to sell up to 25 airports , versus 59 initially , was still on schedule for mid - year . Cabinet Chief Rodriguez told reporters the government was " analyzing " rushing through the airport sale by decree . " We need big investments and we have more than 20 international companies interested in this issue , " he said . ( ( - Buenos Aires Newsroom + 541 318 - 0695 ) )

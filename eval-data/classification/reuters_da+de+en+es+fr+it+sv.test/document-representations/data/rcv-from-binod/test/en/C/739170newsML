U . S . officials deny breach of salmon treaty . U . S . officials denied Canadian allegations on Friday that the United States was breaching an international treaty by overfishing salmon in the Pacific Ocean . " We do not believe we are in violation of this treaty , " a State Department official said . Canada sent a diplomatic note to the State Department on Friday , accusing the United States of failing to live up to its obligations under a 1985 Pacific salmon treaty , Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in Ottawa . U . S . officials confirmed the note had been received , but there was no immediate reply . Canada ' s Fisheries Minister David Anderson said Alaskan fishermen had caught about 350 , 000 Canada - bound sockeye salmon so far in the 1997 season - - an increase of 300 percent from the average of previous years . U . S . officials said Alaskan fishermen always caught some sockeye along with the pink salmon they are entitled to catch , because the two species run together . " It ' s very well known that this year , in 1997 , the stock is quite abundant . . . The catch of both pink salmon and sockeye salmon has been quite high , " said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns . " Our relevant point to make . . . is that the ratio of pink salmon to sockeye so far this season is consistent with the ratio of every year of the last five years , " Burns told a news briefing . " There is no deliberate attempt by the state of Alaska or by Alaskan fishermen to somehow go after sockeye salmon , which violate or exceed the ratio that has been in effect for five years . " Canada and the United States have been holding sporadic talks for months on how to divide Pacific salmon stocks but failed to reach agreement before this year ' s season started . Burns said it was Canada which had walked out of the talks and he urged the Canadians to return to the negotiating table and agree a compromise .

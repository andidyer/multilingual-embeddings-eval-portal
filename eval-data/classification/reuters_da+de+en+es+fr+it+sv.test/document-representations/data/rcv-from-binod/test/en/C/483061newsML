FOCUS - Austrian Airlines faces bumpy ride . Austrian Airlines said on Wednesday its link - up with rival Lauda Air would strengthen its hand in Europe ' s increasingly competitive market but analysts warned that Austria ' s flag carrier could still face turbulent times . Last month , state - controlled Austrian Airlines ( AUA ) bought a 36 percent stake in Lauda and acquired an option to buy an additional 30 percent from founder and former racing driver Niki Lauda . The deal ended years of friction between the two companies and gave AUA a critical say in the running of Austria ' s aviation industry before Europe lifted the last barriers to regional competition on Tuesday . " In AUA , Lauda and ( regional carrier ) Tyrolean we have three different companies under one management , " AUA director Mario Rehulka said in an interview . " All three will help us strengthen our position in the European market . " Analysts described the consolidation as a victory for common sense but cast doubt on AUA ' s ability to survive long term without merging with a foreign airline - - possibly Switzerland ' s Swissair which already has a 10 percent stake in AUA . " The Lauda deal does make commercial sense in that they can start working together now , but from a long - term point of view I doubt that Austrian Airlines can survive in a highly competitive European market , " an international analyst said . With a combined operating income of almost 20 billion schillings ( $ 1 . 7 billion ) , AUA , Lauda and Tyrolean carry some 6 . 2 million passengers to 100 destinations . Even so the " Austrian alliance " has a European market share of just three percent . AUA ' s seat load factor - - an indication of how well an airline fills its planes - - is well below that of its main competitors and a 1996 parent operating loss of 77 million schillings were cause for concern , experts said . " Austrian Airlines has done a tremendously good job in the last five years in restructuring its business . But it still lags behind in terms of performance , " said Charles Donald , analyst at UBS in London . AUA returned to a modest pre - tax profit in 1995 after four years of losses . Last year pre - tax earnings almost doubled to 102 million schillings , but AUA director Herbert Bammer said the carrier had no plans to pay a dividend for 1996 . Instead it would set the money retained against previous losses . According to calculations based on Reuters 3000 data , AUA has a negative operating margin of 0 . 6 percent . Bammer traced the negative figure to a peculiarity of Austrian accounting and estimated the real operating margin was around 2 . 5 percent . That compares with 9 . 4 percent margin at British Airways , 4 . 2 percent at Lufthansa and 3 . 4 percent at Swissair . AUA ' s seat load factor , which dipped perilously close to 50 percent in the first half of last year , recovered towards 59 percent by December , Bammer said . British Airways and Lufthansa had a load factor of almost 69 percent in February . " We are aiming for a significant improvement - - 62 percent this year alone , " Bammer said . " But one should remember we are very active in business travel where the yield is higher . " Bammer and Rehulka said cutting costs , the main task of the past four years , remained a primary challenge . " We have the same personnel costs as we did in 1991 although output has risen by 30 percent . There are some sectors where we are making further efforts : a single air traffic management for Europe and fuel cost reduction , " Rehulka said . The airline ' s Atlantic Excellence code - sharing programme with Swissair , Belgium ' s Sabena and U . S . Delta would also raise efficiency and bring AUA more passengers on transatlantic routes , he added . Bammer said AUA was taking the opening up of the European market in its stride and saw no immediate threat to its domestic business . " I don ' t expect foreign firms to start offering inland flights in Austria . The big markets are France and Germany , " he said . " Equally we have no intention of offering domestic flights in foreign countries . " ( $ = 11 . 76 Austrian Schillings )

Hugo Neu Corp reaffirms its Proler merger offer . Hugo Neu Corp said Friday it has withdrawn its request for a hearing seeking to stop the Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc tender offer for Proler International Corp , and has reaffirmed its proposal to merge with Proler . A spokesman for Hugo Neu said the injunction request was withdrawn because the deadline for Schnitzer ' s offer was extended to November 29 . The deadline was extended Friday when Schnitzer increased its bid to $ 9 . 00 per share from $ 7 . 50 per share . The original Schnitzer offer was to have expired Friday . Hugo Neu on Thursday increased its bid to $ 9 . 00 per share , from $ 8 . 25 per share . " We ' re not walking away from this , " Hugo Neu spokesman Elliot Sloane said . " Nothing can really happen for 10 days . Now , they have two bids at $ 9 . 00 . " Hugo Neu would not say if it intended to sweeten its offer for Proler . Hugo Neu is a private , family business involved in the recovery , recycling and exporting of scrap metals and in industrial real estate development . - - Lisa Marie Pane

US assets expected to benefit from Japan weakness . The U . S . currency is expected to benefit from nervousness over Japan ' s financial markets and pull up all dollar - denominated assets , especially short - term Treasury issues , U . S . analysts said on Sunday . Trading is resuming on Monday in Tokyo where financial markets were closed for a full week around New Year . " If the perception is we are going to go to 120 yen , trading will continue to be dollar - led and other currencies will also depreciate against the dollar , " said chief economist David Resler at Nomura Securities International . Resler - - commenting on fears Japanese equities may come under selling pressure - - noted the dollar began to rise versus the yen before the opening bell in Tokyo . The dollar was quoted at 116 . 70 yen versus 116 . 28 at the close on Friday . The Nikkei 225 stock index is seen as vulnerable because it ended at 19 , 361 . 35 on December 30 - - the last day it traded - - or just above the key psychological 19 , 000 support level . " By default , dollar - denominated assets are looking attractive in this currency environment , " said Resler who predicted " the most probable , immediate place to go would be the short - end of the U . S . Treasury yield curve . " " But this could affect the U . S . Treasury market across the curve , " Resler said of a capital flight out of Japan and into U . S . Treasuries . " If the flight to U . S . assets is driven by Japanese institutional buyers , it could go into longer - dated issues , like bonds , because institutions , like Japanese insurance companies like the long term , " Resler added . A fixed - income strategist at a brokerage house in New York said his firm was planning on buying medium - and long - term Treasuries in the coming days and that the pace of buying would depend on dollar ' s strength . Resler said Japan has little choice but to allow its currency to soften because the monetary and fiscal policy avenues are already closed . Japan ' s interest rates are very low and the 1997 fiscal package offers no real stimulus . " A lot of speculators around the world view the only option left on the table for Japan is the foreign exchange option , " said Resler who expected no more than some jawboning from the Bank of Japan in support of the yen . Currency traders said they do not expect the BoJ to voice support for the yen before the psychological 120 - yen level . " When Japan does get back on its feet , financial markets will pick up and there will be less capital outflows from Japan . But this has not happened yet , " Blitzer said , adding " Japan continues to be a disappointment . " However , Blitzer did not conclude a flight out of Japanese equities would necessarily give a fresh boost to U . S . stocks whose fate is influenced by other factors such as uncertainty over the Federal Reserve ' s next interest rate move . " It ' s hard to assume there is any kind of pattern about what the Fed is going to do next , " noted Blitzer , who tied recent gyrations in the Dow industrials to such uncertainty . Kevin Harris , senior currency analyst at MCM CurrencyWatch , said nervousness over the Nikkei may be offset by euphoria over the Dow ' s 101 . 60 - point surge on Friday . " There is this wonderful transmission factor in equity markets , " Harris said . " When the Dow does well , it sends this wave that goes around the world . " Harris also expected market forces to be the best ally of the yen and yen - denominated assets as profit - takers may want to cash in gains before the dollar resumes its upward trend . " After such a run , the dollar may need a little of a pullback , " Harris predicted . ( ( - - 212 - 859 - 1666 ) )

Brazil to seek special Congress session for reform . The Brazilian government next week will send a bill to parliament that would ease the rules for approving constitutional reforms during a special , one - year congressional session , a legislative whip said on Wednesday . The bill would authorize a special " revisory " session of Congress beginning January 1 , 1999 , said Aecio Neves , lower house leader of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso ' s Brazilian Social Democratic Party ( PSDB ) . During that year , constitutional amendments would require a straight majority in each of house of Congress . Under normal rules , amendments to the constitution require three - fifths majorities in two separate votes in each house . That challenge has thwarted the government ' s hopes of reforming the civil service and the pension system for the past two years . Political analysts and newspaper columnists have long believed the government would resort to calling a revisory session as an solution to its difficulties in winning approval for the reforms . The Brazilian Congress held a revisory session in 1993 as stipulated in the 1988 constitution . But the aftermath of the resignation of former president Fernando Collor and a budget scandal in Congress combined to make that session unproductive . The bill to authorize the new revisory session would itself take the form of a constitutional amendment , requiring the usual two three - fifths majorities in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate . It would also have to be ratified in a national referendum , held on the same day as presidential and congressional elections in October 1998 . Neves played down suggestions that the decision to send the bill to Congress represented an admission by the government that it would not succeed in winning approval of the civil service and pension reforms before next year ' s elections . Instead , he said , the government felt the reforms as they stood were too watered down and that a revisory session was needed to implement genuine change . The revisory session " is a measure we feel to be necessary after deciding that the reforms have not been as deep as they could have been , " Neves said . ( ( - - Brasilia newsroom 5561 2230358 ) )

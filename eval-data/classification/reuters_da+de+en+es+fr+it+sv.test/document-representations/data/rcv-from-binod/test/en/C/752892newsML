S . Korea ' s Kia cuts deeper as govt offers no aid . South Korea ' s embattled Kia Group said on Thursday it was considering tougher self - rescue measures to drag itself out of debt after the government signalled it would not intervene to save the eighth - ranked conglomerate . But the government took broader actions on Thursday to ease pressures on the country ' s troubled corporate sector by supplying money to banking institutions and vowing to punish rumour mongers , which are blamed for the current crisis . Kia Group said it had told its main creditor Korea First Bank that the top 21 Kia executives , including chairman Kim Sun - hong , would resign if the group ' s self - rescue efforts failed . A key requirement of South Korea ' s bankruptcy protection committee of banks is that groups tapped for bail - out agree to relinquish management rights to their creditors . Kia on Thursday slashed 23 executive positions and said it was considering further reducing the number of its executives above director level by 50 percent . Earlier this week it said the number of executives would be cut by 30 percent . The group also said it might sell its commercial vehicle maker Asia Motors Co Ltd and its sales affiliate , Asia Motor Sales Co . Last week , Kia Group was put under the protection of its creditor banks after they determined Kia would default on debt payments . Earlier Kia had said it would slim down by reducing the number of its domestic affiliates to 13 from the current 28 . If Kia decides to sell the two Asia Motors units , its local affiliates would number 11 . " The senior management is considering these measures to step up our self - rescue efforts in line with creditors ' demands , " a Kia Group spokesman said . He said it was not yet determined when final decisions would be made . But a source close to Kia Group said these decisions were " inevitable " because of pressures by creditor banks . Analysts said additional steps appeared unavoidable after Finance Minister Kang Kyong - shik said the government had no plans to intervene to save the struggling Kia Group . " The government has no plans to support an individual company through such measures as debt guarantees and loans from the government at the expense of the public , " Kang was quoted by senior ministry officials as telling President Kim Young - sam on Wednesday . However , the finance ministry later said it would supply 1 . 5 trillion won ( $ 1 . 68 billion ) to banks and merchant banks to ease tightening liquidity as a result of troubles with Kia Group . " For the time being , the government will ward off further corporate bankruptcies by actively supplying funds to prevent credit crunch , " said Lee Won - il , head of research at KEB Smith Barney Securities . Lee said Kia Group would be permitted to pursue its restructuring program for the time being , but ultimately the group would be dismantled and sold off . Hoping to prevent further corporate failures because of rumours , the Securities Supervisory Board said it would start cracking down on rumour mongers to protect investors and corporate activities . It said corporate - related rumours , which had subsided after the Hanbo and Jinro group crises , had increased after the Kia Group ' s troubles surfaced last week . " This will prevent possible rumours that some other corporates are facing financial problems or will follow Kia ' s suit , " said Park Jong - kwan at Coryo Securities . ( $ 1 = 894 won )

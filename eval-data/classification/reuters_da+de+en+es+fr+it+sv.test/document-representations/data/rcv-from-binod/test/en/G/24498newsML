More Austrian arrests in child abuse scandals . Austrian police arrested two men on Friday for suspected sexual abuse of children aged between four and 15 living in a shelter for refugees in the city of Linz , police said . The two Austrians , one aged 59 and the other 37 , lived near the shelter for refugee children and had allegedly enticed their victims to their homes with offers of sweets and money during months of abuse , police said . " Two men have been placed under arrest under suspicion of sexually abusing children from the refugee shelter , " said a police spokesman in Linz , 200 km ( 120 miles ) west of Vienna . Police declined to reveal the nationalities of the children at the home , though the vast majority of refugees currently living in Austria come from the former Yugoslavia . Pyschologists counselling the boys and girls reported that the children had said the men had done evil things to them , the Austrian news agency APA reported . The arrests were made just two days after Vienna police detained three men on charges of child sex abuse and producing child pornography in a suspected " child - for - hire " network spread across central Europe . Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek said he was shocked by the arrests and said the courts would deal harshly with those convicted of child abuse crimes . Michalek said Austrians would be morally culpable if they knew abuse was being perpetrated and failed to report it . " It is important that people do not try to ignore what is going on . Whoever does that is at least morally , possibly criminally , culpable , " he told the Salzburger Nachrichten daily in an interview published in its Saturday edition . News of yet more instances of child abuse in Austria will heighten the revulsion expressed in local media over the child abuse and murder of young girls in Belgium . Belgian Marc Dutroux , alleged to be the dominant person in a paedophile pornography ring , has been named by police in the Slovak capital , Bratislava , as a suspect in the murder of one Slovak woman and the kidnapping of another . Bratislava is an hour ' s drive away from Vienna . Austrian police declined to comment on whether there was a connection between the Belgian case and the Vienna arrests . Two of the men detained in Vienna are Austrian citizens , one born in Slovakia and the other in the Czech Republic . The third is Polish , police said . All three denied the charges on Friday . Vice squad officers seized box - loads of videos and other pornographic material from the home of one of the suspects at the start of a major investigation into the procuring of children , some as young as seven , to paedophiles in the region . Police sources said the hunt for others connected to the ring could involve neighbouring Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Germany . The Austrian current affairs magazine News launched a major investigative report into the Vienna - based network which provided clients in the Austrian capital with a choice of 70 girls , largely from Slovakia , aged between seven and 13 . News presented its evidence to police this week before the arrests were made .

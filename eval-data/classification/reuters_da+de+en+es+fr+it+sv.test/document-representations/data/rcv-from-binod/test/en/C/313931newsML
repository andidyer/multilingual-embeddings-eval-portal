RESEARCH ALERT - Merrill upgraded UPM . Merrill Lynch has raised its recommendation on the biggest Finnish forest industry group UPM - Kymmene Oy to buy from accumulate , it said in a sector review dated January 13 . UPM - Kymmene " is gradually replacing Stora as our favoured core play in the sector , " Merrill said , adding that first - class assets made UPM very competitive . It saw UPM - Kymmene ' s pre - tax earnings rising to 5 . 0 billion markka in 1998 , up 60 percent on its forecast for 1997 . Merrill Lynch said it expected paper industry fundamentals to recover towards the end of 1997 . " We believe that paper and pulp industry fundamentals will bottom during the first half of 1997 followed by a sustainable recovery towards the end of the year , " Merrill said . " At this stage of the cycle , we favour companies exposed to early cyclical grades such as containerboard and companies with high upside potential versus downward risk , " it said . Merrill said it was still concerned about the short - term development for pulp and fine paper . " We expect prices for these grades to be under pressure during the first half of 1997 . " " We recommend UPM - Kymmene as the company with the biggest upside potential in relation to risk , " it said . It said it would avoid companies with a high exposure to newsprint " as lower newsprint prices in 1997 are likely to curb earnings momentum for these companies .

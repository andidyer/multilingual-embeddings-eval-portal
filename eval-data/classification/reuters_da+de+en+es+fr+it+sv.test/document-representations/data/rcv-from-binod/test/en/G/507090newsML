U . S . affirms to back anti - China vote on rights . The United States reaffirmed on Monday that it would give full backing to a resolution calling on China to observe human rights and protect the ethnic identity of Tibetans in a key United Nations body . Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck told a news conference his country would be co - sponsoring the resolution in the world body ' s Human Rights Commission when it comes to a vote on Tuesday or Wednesday . " We do not seek confrontation with China but we do seek greater respect for the rule of law and for acceptance of basic principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , " Shattuck declared . But although U . S . officials privately expressed confidence that they would get good support , diplomats said a Chinese motion for " no action " on the resolution was likely to be passed easily as it was last year . China , mainly with support from Asian and African members of the Commission , has fought off EU and U . S . efforts to have the body censure Beijing for the past six years in a row . The resolution , one of 19 on individual countries and their rights records to be considered by the 53 - member Commission over the next two days , was tabled by Denmark after a row over its value among European Union states . Netherlands was originally , as current holder of the EU ' s rotating presidency , due to be its main sponsor on behalf of the whole Union but refused to go ahead when France , Germany , Italy , Spain and Greece said they could not support it . The EU has traditionally tabled the resolution on China at the annual session of the Commission , which many developing countries argue is manipulated by the Western powers to focus attention on poorer states . The dissenting EU members argue that it makes no sense to continue the effort to censure Beijing , arguing that constructive dialogue is likely to be the more productive approach . Critics say they are more concerned with trade ties . Shattuck said the United States recognised that China has undergone " significant transformation " through economic reforms that had brought greater well - being for ordinary people " and greater scope for individual choice . " Nevertheless , China ' s government continues to commit widespread and well - documented human rights violations and to severely restrict fundamental freedoms of speech , the press , assembly , association and religion in violation of internationally - established norms , " he declared . Shattuck said the United States would take the lead on several country resolutions in the Commission , including on Cuba , whose government , he asserted , " maintains a repressive system that denies the Cuban people basic rights " . The Cuba resolution has support among European countries on the Commission , although many sympathise with the body ' s Swedish special investigator who has argued for several years that U . S . hostility has made the rights situation on the island worse . Other countries facing annual strictures in U . S . - backed resolutions include Burma , Iran , Iraq , Sudan , Nigeria and the military government of the central African state of Burundi .

Closing arguments end in Simpson custody fight . Closing arguments ended on Wednesday in O . J . Simpson ' s legal battle for custody of his two young children , but the judge in the case did not immediately issue a ruling , a court spokeswoman said . After a full - day , closed - door hearing in Orange County family court , Judge Nancy Wieben Stock took the matter " under submission " and will issue a written decision later , said court spokeswoman Debbie Garcia . Garcia said she could not say how long it would take the judge to reach a ruling in the case . Sydney , 11 , and Justin , 8 , have lived with the parents of Simpson ' s slain ex - wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , since shortly after her death on June 12 , 1994 . But Simpson , who was acquitted in October 1995 in the murders of his ex - wife and her friend , now wants his children back . Simpson , who is embroiled in a civil wrongful - death trial in nearby Santa Monica , was in the Orange County courtroom on Wednesday for closing arguments in the custody battle . Attorneys for Louis and Juditha Brown have contended that Simpson - - who signed over temporary guardianship to them after his June 17 , 1994 , arrest - - is an unfit parent , citing allegations that he beat and threatened his ex - wife . But Simpson ' s lawyers have argued that he has a right to full custody as the biological father .

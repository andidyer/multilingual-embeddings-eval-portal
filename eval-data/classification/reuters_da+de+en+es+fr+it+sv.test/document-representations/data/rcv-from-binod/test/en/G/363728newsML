Sri Lanka may deport convicted Swiss paedophile . A Swiss paedophile , the first foreigner to be convicted in a Sri Lanka court , has been sentenced to two years in prison for having sex with two boys and may be deported , Sri Lankan police said on Friday . Police have asked immigration authorities to deport Armin Heinrich Pfaffhauser of Zurich , Switzerland , said Noel Francis , assistant superintendent of the police crimes division . On Thursday , a Sri Lankan magistrate sentenced the 58 - year - old Swiss national to two years in jail after a two - year trial for " committing an unnatural offence " on two Sri Lankan boys aged 12 and 13 years in February 1995 . The case marked the first time a foreign national was convicted for sexually abusing children in Sri Lanka , widely regarded as a popular destination for the world ' s paedophiles . Pfaffhauser had pleaded not guilty . " Why should a man like this be kept and fed by us ? We would like to have him deported to Switzerland so that he can be tried and sentenced in his own country , " Francis said . But a children ' s rights group opposed the idea of deporting him . " How can he be deported when he is convicted to serve a jail sentence here ? " said Maureen Seneviratne of Protecting Environment and Children Everywhere ( PEACE ) , a Colombo - based non - governmental organisation trying to curb child sex tourism . " It will undoubtedly set a bad precedent , " she said . Kalyananda Tiranagama of Lawyers for Human Rights and Development , another non - governmental organisation , said the sentence may be a deterrent . " We ' re somewhat satisfied we were able to secure at least one conviction , " he said . " This may have a deterrent effect . " Tiranagama said the sentence would have been much tougher had the suspect been tried under a new law passed in late 1995 . The new law calls for a minimum 10 - year jail - term and a maximum 20 - year sentence for pimps and their clients . It pushed the minimum age of consent up to 18 for boys and 16 for girls , making sex with anyone under this age a crime . Child abuse cases are pending against another Swiss , a German and a Belgian national in Sri Lankan courts . Another Swiss national , who jumped bail , is being tried in absentia .

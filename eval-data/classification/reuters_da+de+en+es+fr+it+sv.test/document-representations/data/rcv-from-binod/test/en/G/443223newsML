Mother Teresa vows to keep ministering to the poor . Mother Teresa on Friday cheerfully handed over leadership of her Roman Catholic order to Sister Nirmala but pledged to carry on her work for the world ' s poor and sick . " I have plenty of work to do , " the 86 - year - old Nobel Peace Prize winner told a crowd of journalists who filled the courtyard of the headquarters of her Missionaries of Charity in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta . " I will remain in Calcutta , " said Mother Teresa , standing beside her successor on a balcony overlooking the courtyard . Sister Nirmala , a Hindu Brahmin who converted to Christianity at age 23 , was elected by 132 senior nuns on Thursday as superior general , succeeding Mother Teresa who had held the post since she founded the order in 1948 . The order ' s new leader humbly paid homage to Mother Teresa , saying she would depend on the renowned missionary for guidance . " Mother is there to guide us , " Sister Nirmala , 63 , said . Asked if she felt like the mission ' s leader , the Indian - born Sister Nirmala said : " Mother is our foundress and we are all her children . I am not the head of the order . We are all equal . " The Missionaries of Charity said on Thursday that Mother Teresa would retain her name " Mother " but Sister Nirmala , whose parents were from the Hindu kingdom of Nepal , would assume her administrative duties . Mother Teresa , who had commanded the order with an iron will for nearly half a century , decided last year to step down after being taken to hospital three times for emergency care , including her second heart operation . Bedridden for weeks last year , a jovial Mother Teresa said she had since recovered . " I am feeling very happy . I ' m much better , " she said . Mother Teresa addressed the journalists from a first - floor balcony , flanked by Sister Nirmala and Sister Frederick , an 81 - year - old nun who was elected to the second ranking post . Nuns dressed in the order ' s familiar white saris with blue trim crowded behind the three women and thronged surrounding balconies , occasionally clapping and cheering . Mother Teresa , who spoke quietly into a small microphone , bantered with the press . Asked where the Missionaries of Charity was headed now that there was a new leader , she quipped : " China . " At the end of the 30 - minute news conference , Mother Teresa blessed Sister Nirmala by placing her hand on her successor ' s head . Sister Nirmala was born a high - caste Hindu in 1934 from a family with its roots in Nepal - - the world ' s only Hindu kingdom . She was the oldest of 11 children . Sister Nirmala ' s deceased father , Mahananda Joshi , served in the military police in the northern Indian state of Bihar , where Mother Teresa ' s successor was born . She earned a master ' s degree in political science before converting to Catholicism in 1958 . " I heard from God in a hostel in Patna Women ' s College , " Sister Nirmala said . " After six years I came to Calcutta and Mother baptised me . When I received the call I was 17 . But I joined Missionaries of Charity when I was 23 . " The order ' s new leader , who wears spectacles and is taller than Mother Teresa , was asked if she had any message to give to the followers of the Missionaries of Charity . " We remain true and carry forward the task handed down to us , " she said .

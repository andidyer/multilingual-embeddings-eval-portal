Matsushita profit recovers strongly in April - June . Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd enjoyed a very strong recovery in its group profits in the first quarter of the 1996 / 97 business year . Matsushita said on Tuesday it posted net profit of 18 . 5 billion yen ( $ 172 million ) on a group basis in the three months to June 30 , rebounding from a huge loss of 151 . 3 billion yen ( $ 1 . 41 billion ) a year ago . It also said its sales in the April - June period were 1 . 72 trillion yen ( $ 16 . 0 billion ) , up from 1 . 53 trillion yen ( $ 14 . 2 billion ) a year ago . " Our business ( in the first quarter of the current business year ) was better than the same period a year ago both in Japan and abroad , " the company said in a statement announcing group earnings for the quarter . In Japan , consumer spending and companies ' capital investment were rebounding gradually , and the nation ' s economy was on a gradual recovery trend , although some worries over the future of the economy remained , Matsushita said . Economies in the United States and Asia were strong and the European economy started showing signs of recovery , it said . In most of the company ' s divisions , sales were up by between 10 and 26 percent from year - ago levels , Matsushita said . But it also said sales at its electronic parts division fell three percent , partly due to the sluggish semiconductor market . Cost cutting and the weaker yen also boosted group profits in the first quarter , Matsushita said . A drop in the yen makes Japanese companies more competitive overseas , because this lowers the price of their goods in foreign exchange terms . Matsushita said it posted a group net loss in the first quarter of 1995 / 96 because of foreign exchange losses stemming from the sale of an 80 percent stake in U . S . film maker MCA Inc . If the impact of the sale was excluded , Matsushita would have made a group net profit of 12 . 9 billion yen ( $ 120 million ) in that quarter , it said . Despite a strong recovery in group earnings in the first quarter , Matsushita said it had not changed its forecast for its parent current profit and sales for the half - year to September 30 , 1996 , because there remained uncertainties over the overall Japanese economy and the yen / dollar exchange rate . Matsushita had projected its April - September parent current profit at 46 billion yen ( $ 429 million ) on expected sales of 2 . 2 trillion yen ( $ 20 . 5 billion ) . In 1995 / 96 , Matsushita posted a first - half parent current profit of 41 . 22 billion yen ( $ 385 million ) on sales of 2 . 16 trillion yen ( $ 20 . 1 billion ) . ( $ 1 = 107 yen )

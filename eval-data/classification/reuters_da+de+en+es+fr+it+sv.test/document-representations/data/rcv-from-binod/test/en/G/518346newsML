Israel destroys homes of two suspected militants . Israel destroyed the West Bank homes of two Palestinians suspected of belonging to an Islamic militant group accused of killing 11 Israelis since 1996 , the army said on Thursday . An Israeli army spokeswoman said one house was destroyed on Wednesday evening and one on Thursday morning . A third house sealed earlier this week could be destroyed , pending the outcome of a court hearing , the army said . All houses are located in Sourif village . Palestinians said residents of the 13 , 000 - strong village defied an Israeli army curfew and stoned soldiers guarding demolition crews . The soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets and at least five Arabs were wounded , Palestinians said . Owners of the three houses were among a suspected Hamas cell rounded up by Israel and the Palestinian Authority last week . A sixth member of the group died when a bomb he was placing in a Tel Aviv cafe blew up in March . It killed three Israeli women . Israel says that since early 1996 , the cell has been responsible for the deaths of 11 Israelis - - including a soldier kidnapped in September . The soldier ' s body was found buried in Sourif last week , and the town has since been under curfew . Israel routinely destroys the homes of Palestinians suspected of carrying out attacks against the Jewish state . Palestinians call the demolitions collective punishment .

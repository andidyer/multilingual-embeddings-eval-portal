White House rivals hold holiday meeting . Marking the Christmas season , President Bill Clinton and his vanquished Republican rival Bob Dole shared campaign memories and exchanged gifts during an hour - long White House meeting on Friday . " They met in the Oval Office , just the two of them , for about an hour . They had a very warm visit that the president described as being fascinating and fun , " White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters after the political reunion , which was not announced in advance . Clinton and Dole , who repeatedly slammed the president on character issues in the final weeks of the campaign before the Nov . 5 election , had " compared notes on the election and probably agreed how miserable their staffs were , " McCurry said . He said Dole came to the White House bearing a gift from his dog Leader to Clinton ' s cat Socks - - a Christmas stocking stuffed with animal treats . Clinton also gave Dole a present , but would not tell his spokesman what it was because Dole might be " the kind of guy who waits until Christmas to open his gifts . " However , McCurry speculated that Clinton ' s gift to Dole was a White House Christmas tree ornament and other trinkets .

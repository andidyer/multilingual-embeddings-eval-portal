FOCUS - Norwich Union outlines share giveaway . Almost two million Norwich Union policyholders are to receive free shares worth around 800 pounds ( $ 1 , 280 ) each when the mutually - owned insurance group floats on the London stock market in June . Another one million non - profit members will receive a fixed hand - out of shares worth between 330 and 400 pounds , the company said on Thursday as it unveiled its flotation plans . In addition to the free shares , Norwich said it planned to raise an additional 1 . 75 billion pounds in May . Existing Norwich members will have the opportunity to purchase shares at a discount yet to be announced . The flotation will value Norwich at around five billion pounds , putting it among Britain ' s largest 50 companies . Members will vote on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting in London on April 18 . The company will need the backing of three - quarters of members who vote . The planned payout to policyholders is comfortably ahead of the 500 pounds many industry observers had expected . Norwich chief executive Allan Bridegwater said he believed the group ' s mutual structure was no longer appropriate and that flotation was the best way forward for the company and its members " The distribution of free shares represents a significant release of value to qualifying members , " he said . " The free share scheme which we have developed recognises the value of existing membership rights . The discounted offer of additional shares will give members a further opportunity to participate in the future of Norwich Union . " The share handout will be worth a total of around 3 . 1 billion pounds , the two million with - profit members receiving between 300 and 600 shares depending on the value and duration of their holdings as of October 1 , 1996 . Non - profit members will get a fixed allocation of 150 shares . Norwich ' s adviser Dresdner Kleinwort Benson estimated the shares would be worth between 220 and 265 pence each had they been listed at the end of February . The flotation will allow the separation of the group ' s life operations from its more volatile and cyclical general business . It will also strengthen the group ' s financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom . The general insurance business will be transferred from the life fund to shareholder ownership and the life and pensions operations to a subsidiary company . Norwich Union , which reported pre - tax profit in 1996 of 483 million pounds , said it believed the improvement in the life and pensions market would be to its long - term benefit but that results of its general insurance arm would continue to be affected by pricing pressure in 1997 , particularly in Britain . Around 1 . 5 billion pounds of the money raised through the sale of addional shares will go into the with - profits fund , enabling the company to continue to deliver policy benefits to existing policyholders . The balance , less the 120 million pound cost of the flotation , will be used for corporate purposes , although the company was quick to dismiss the possibility of immediate acquistions . " We ' re not raising a war chest , " said Bridgewater . Shareholder circulars were due to be mailed on Thursday and the group expects the prospectus for the additional share offer to be issued in May . The flotation will take place in June .

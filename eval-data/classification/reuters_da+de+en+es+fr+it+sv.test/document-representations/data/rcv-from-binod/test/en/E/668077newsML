Canada sees little inflation pressure in May . Inflationary pressure was nowhere in sight in Canada on Tuesday , with the consumer price index for May rising only 1 . 5 percent on the year , down from a 1 . 7 percent gain in April . The federal statistics agency , Statistics Canada , said consumer prices scarcely changed during the month , advancing only 0 . 1 percent from April . Core inflation - - the consumer price index excluding volatile food and energy prices - - was up 1 . 7 percent on the year . " It ' s right on expectations , " said Mark Chandler , senior economist at Goldman Sachs . " The Bank of Canada won ' t be looking at this as a leading indicator of what they should do in the near future . I don ' t see ( the central bank ) changing their policy , which is to tighten over the next six months . " The Bank of Canada keeps a close watch on the core inflation rate , aiming to keep the rate between 1 and 3 percent . The central bank recently has hinted it would tighten monetary conditions after more than a year of slashing interest rates to stimulate the gasping Canadian economy . But with inflation slipping in May , economists said the central bank would probably not make any changes in the near term . " I think the Bank of Canada will want to see more evidence ( of inflationary pressure ) before it decides to tighten , " said Craig Wright , economist at the Royal Bank of Canada . " The Bank is going to be in no rush to tighten before late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter , " he said . A Reuters survey of economists had on average forecast that year - over - year CPI would show a rise of 1 . 6 percent and the core CPI an increase of 1 . 8 percent . Statistics Canada said much of the year ' s 1 . 5 percent rise in overall prices stemmed from higher prices for new vehicles , vehicle insurance , post - secondary school tuition , meat and tobacco products . The federal agency said that over the same period , consumers saw lower prices for mortgage loans and gasoline . The Canadian dollar and bond markets barely reacted to the Canadian CPI numbers .

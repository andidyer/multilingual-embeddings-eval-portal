US FY ' 97 deficit expected below $ 50 bln - Moynihan . The Congressional Budget Office has slashed its estimate of the federal budget deficit for the fiscal year ending on September 30 to below $ 50 billion , Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan said . " CBO expects a deficit of less than $ 50 billion , " the New York Democrat said in a statement released by his office . That is down from a $ 67 billion deficit forecast by CBO just two months ago and a $ 124 billion prediction by it earlier this year , Moynihan noted . " The budget of the U . S . government - - as a result of a spectacular and unprecedented combination of economic growth , low unemployment and low inflation - - is on the verge of balancing itself , " Moynihan said . " It is now seriously in question whether the wisest course is for Congress to leave well enough alone , " he added . In particular , Moynihan questioned the desirability of cutting taxes at a time when the economy was doing so well . " If a recession does occur , that ' s the time to cut taxes and stimulate the economy , " he said . Neverthless , the New York lawmaker said he realized that Congress will take action .

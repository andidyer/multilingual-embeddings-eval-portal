Peru seeks bloodless outcome at captured embassy . President Alberto Fujimori moved to dampen speculation on Friday that his government was planning to use force to end Peru ' s 80 - day hostage crisis , restating that he was committed to a bloodless solution . Fujimori , grappling with the toughest challenge to his authority since taking office in 1990 , told mediators he would keep pushing for the peaceful release of 72 hostages being held by Marxist rebels at the Japanese ambassador ' s residence . In a statement , Fujimori said he would use " a humanitarian sense and seek to resolve the crisis by peaceful means . " But he did not rule out the use of force if hostages were harmed , saying the peaceful route would stay in effect only as long as the guerrillas " fully respected the life and health of the hostages . " " The state , in consequence , will stay alert at all times to any change in this scenario , " the statement said . The 20 - odd Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels holding the diplomatic residence broke off negotiations this week charging that the government planned to storm the compound through secret tunnels . But Fujimori assured guarantors of the talks who met with him on Friday that he still wanted a peaceful outcome . " We have received the express confirmation of this very same intention from the president in a meeting , " Vatican representative Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani said in a statement read to reporters . Cipriani , a member of the three - man " guarantors commission , " noted that Fujimori and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had agreed in Canada last month to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis and prevent loss of life . Fujimori , still stung by the rebels rejection of his offer to allow them to seek asylum in Cuba , huddled with his negotiators on Friday to map their next move , meeting twice with his chief negotiator Domingo Palermo . The MRTA ' s refusal to attend a tenth face - to - face meeting with the government dashed optimism that a peaceful solution was nearing and again injected a tense tone to the standoff . The government ' s defence minister denied the existence of the tunnels , but Lima newspapers were full of precise details of where and how they were being built . One report , citing state sources , gave the exact address of the building where one tunnel supposedly began and even said it would lead into the compound ' s kitchen or dining room . Japan appealed on the rebels to reconsider their stand . " The Japanese government strongly supports efforts . . . to secure the safe release of all the hostages , " government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told reporters . " Therefore , we hope the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement side will attend the next round of preliminary dialogue . " The rebels have been holding 72 hostages , including Fujimori ' s brother Pedro and two of his cabinet ministers , since mid - December at the residence , a spacious diplomatic compound in a wealthy Lima neighbourhood . The negotiations were thrown into confusion on Thursday when rebel leader Nestor Cerpa said he had evidence the government aimed to rescue the hostages while he and his second - in - command , Rolly Rojas , attended talks at a safe house across the street from the diplomatic residence . " We are not going to attend the negotiations because the right conditions do not exist for a transparent process , " he said in a walkie - talkie interview from within the residence . " All of a sudden , they are waiting for us to leave to start an attack , taking advantage of our absence , " he said . " Without doubt ( there is ) a tactic to attack from the outside . . . We have been hearing noises from underneath the floor . " Security force sources consulted by Reuters confirmed that at least four tunnels had been dug under the compound in recent weeks , while loud music was played by police outside . The tunnels would be used if there was an attack , which would last seven minutes and cause many deaths , they added .

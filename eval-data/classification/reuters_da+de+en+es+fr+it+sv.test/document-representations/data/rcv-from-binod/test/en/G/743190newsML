186 Kurds seek asylum in Italy . Nearly 200 Kurds who were seized off the Sicilian coast last week as they tried to row ashore have requested political asylum in Italy , police said on Monday . They said the 186 Kurds would be interviewed on Tuesday before their request was considered . The Kurds were among 350 immigrants from countries across Asia who boarded rubber dinghies from a Turkish ship off the island ' s southeast coast last Thursday . Coast guards blocked the dinghies before surrounding the ship and escorting it into port where police arrested five Turkish crew members on charges of trafficking illegal immigrants . The immigrants were being held at a local sports centre .

FORECAST - Israel March CPI seen up 0 . 7 pct . Israel ' s March consumer price index ( CPI ) , to be released on Tuesday , is expected to rise by 0 . 7 percent on a month - on - month basis following a 1 . 2 percent increase in February , economists said on Sunday . In March 1996 , the CPI rose 1 . 0 percent . An increase of 0 . 7 percent in March 1997 would bring inflation in the past 12 months to 10 . 1 percent . " A rise of 0 . 7 percent is normal for March , not high not low , reasonable , " said Hezi Gutman , chief economist at First International Bank of Israel . Bank Hapoalim also predicted March inflation of 0 . 7 percent , as did the Israeli Federation of Chambers of Commerce . The federation said housing prices are expected to post a rise of 0 . 8 percent . Higher prices are also seen for transportation , telecommunications and fruit and vegetables while a decline is expected for clothing and footware . The federation forecast inflation for the year would total 9 . 4 percent against 10 . 6 percent in 1996 . Israel Discount Bank forecast the CPI would rise 10 . 0 - 10 . 5 percent this year , Hapoalim forecast 8 . 7 percent , and First International 8 . 5 - 9 . 0 percent . The government has set a 1997 inflation target of 7 - 10 percent . Gutman said that if the March CPI does post a rise of 0 . 7 percent it is unlikely that the Bank of Israel will lower interest rates for April at its monthly review of monetary policy . " April traditionally is a high month for inflation . The ( central bank ) governor will be cautious . From a timing point of view , it is not the right time to lower rates . I think he will wait at least another month , " Gutman said . If the March CPI rise is significantly less than 0 . 7 percent , the central bank may make a symbolic gesture , lowering the base rate by up to 0 . 5 percentage point , Gutman said . The Bank of Israel ' s base rate has been at an annualised 13 . 9 percent since the end of February after falling 3 . 1 percentage points in the previous seven months . - Tova Cohen , Tel Aviv newsroom , 972 - 3 - 537 - 2211

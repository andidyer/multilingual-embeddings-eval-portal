The rise in the overall index was restrained by poorer performances in the bond and foreign currency funds . Bond funds showed an average return of 1 . 5 percent in November and foreign currency funds an average of 0 . 5 percent . Bond funds were helped by a strong rise in convertible bonds in the month , Meitav said . The performance of the share funds marks a sharp turnaround .

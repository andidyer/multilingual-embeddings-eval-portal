Mother Teresa successor election within a month . A postponed election to find a successor to Mother Teresa as the head of her Missionaries of Charity religious order will be held within a month , Calcutta ' s Archibishop Henry D ' Souza said on Sunday . " They will hold discussions for about a month . Any time during that period they can make up their mind to choose a successor to Mother Teresa , " D ' Souza told reporters in the Indian city of Calcutta . The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner , now 86 , has decided to retire as the superior general of the Roman Catholic order because of heart , kidney and lung problems . Mother Teresa , noted for her charisma and quiet strength , founded the order which is now spread over 111 countries . A regular six - year election by secret ballot set for last September was delayed as the revered nun went into hospital in August with heart problems , malaria and penumonia . The election to choose a new superior - general was then set for Sunday , D ' Souza said . " They talked about February 2 and even Mother Teresa wanted it on February 2 , the day of the Feast of Our Lady , " D ' Souza said . " But she did not know that she will get sick now , " he added . Dr . Ashish Kumar , who is now treating the missionary , said Mother Teresa , who suffered breathing problems and spinal pain last week , was better than she was a few days ago . " I have been visiting her . She is better now , " he said . But a spokeswoman of the Missionaries of Charity said the election originally set for Sunday was postponed to help an electoral college and the general chapter of the Missonaries of Charity to get to know each other better . The electoral college comprises representatives from various sections of the order , which has about 4 , 500 nuns . " This time , there are 132 members of the electoral college who have come from around the world . They need more time to know each other better and become more frank among themselves during the deliberations , " the spokeswoman said . Senior nuns began a two - week retreat on January 16 to select a successor to Mother Teresa . The retreat was to be followed by meetings of the general chapter before a secret ballot originally set for Sunday . Known as the Saint of the Gutters for her devotion to the poor and dying , Mother Teresa spent three weeks in hospital in August and September for heart trouble , malaria and pneumonia . Two weeks later , she fell off a chair and struck her head . In November , she underwent an operation to unblock two coronary arteries for her third heart surgery in five years . Mother Teresa had wanted to step down in 1990 , one year after she was fitted with a heart pacemaker , because of ill health . But her colleagues asked her to stay on .

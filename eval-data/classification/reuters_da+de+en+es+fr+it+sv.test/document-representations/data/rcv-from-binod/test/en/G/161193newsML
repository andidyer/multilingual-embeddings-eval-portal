Burma ' s military says trying to understand Suu Kyi . Burma ' s military government is taking steps to improve relations with Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party , a senior military official said on Friday . Senior Defence Ministry official Colonel Kyaw Thein said both the pro - democracy movement and the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) have been trying to break an impasse after being locked in a war of words for over a year . " Both sides may be trying to improve the situation ( and ) their understanding of each other , " Kyaw Thein told reporters after the SLORC ' s monthly news conference . He said Kyi Maung , a top aide to Suu Kyi and deputy chairman of the NLD , was detained on October 23 for questioning partly to give the SLORC an understanding of the pro - democracy party ' s current attitude . " We wanted to have a clearer picture of what we are thinking about the NLD and concerning the current situation . " Kyi Maung was released on Monday . A senior military officer , Lieutenant - Colonel Than Thun - - Suu Kyi ' s liason officer during her six years of house arrest - - has also recently had a couple of brief meetings with the Nobel Peace laureate , Kyaw Thein confirmed . Although some diplomats say the meetings could reflect warming relations between the SLORC and the pro - democracy movement , Kyaw Thein said the meetings did not have any major significance . Suu Kyi has made repeated , unanswered calls for dialogue with the SLORC since the government released her from house arrest in July 1995 . The SLORC traditionally says the forum for dialogue is the National Convention , a group of delegates mostly hand - picked by the SLORC who have met intermittently since 1993 to draft guidelines for a new constitution . Suu Kyi angered the government last November when she pulled her NLD party out of the talks , saying the forum did not represent the will of the people . The NLD won more than 80 percent of the seats in a 1990 election , which was called by the SLORC , but was never allowed to take power because the government refused to recognise the poll results . Kyaw Thein also hinted that Suu Kyi may be allowed to hold her regular weekend speeches to supporters - - if she agrees to some ground rules . " We are allowing the NLD to hold meetings inside the compound , " he said . " We have asked people and asked those who are responsible inside the compound that if they want to make a meeting they can do it inside the compound . " Since her release , Suu Kyi has made speeches to supporters on Saturdays and Sundays from the front gates of her University Avenue home , drawing crowds of up to about 10 , 000 people . The government has taken various measures to prevent the speeches , because it says such gatherings are illegal and they obstruct the flow of traffic . For the past five weekends the SLORC has blocked vehicle and pedestrian access to University Avenue by setting up checkpoints manned by heavily - armed security police . The barricades were removed earlier this week and remained down on Friday . Kyaw Thein would not say if barricades would be raised again , but a senior official told Reuters if Suu Kyi agreed to meet supporters inside her compound the government would not do anything . " But if they are outside , the police will probably come and round them up , " he said . Suu Kyi has previously said she would not hold the speeches inside , because she had the right to speak in public .

NAIC views trust preferred stock as debt . A taskforce of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) has developed criteria that would allow insurance companies to classify investments in trust preferred stock as debt for risk - based capital purposes , according to an NAIC official . " Based on the discussions we had today , trust preferred instruments would be classified as debt , " said Larrry Gorski , chairman of the NAIC ' s Valuation of Securities Taskforce . Based on NAIC risk - based capital rules , insurance companies are required to hold 2 . 0 percent greater capital reserves for preferred stock than debt , making it more economical for the institutions to invest in bonds . Analysts said the ruling was likely to increase insurance company investments in trust preferred stock , which has recently been issued by banks . Because many market players have been swapping their investments in intermediate - and long - term bank bonds to buy the new securities , the decision may also increase selling pressure on bank bonds , they said . The panel ' s recommendation is expected to be adopted by the Securities Valuation Office Taskforce of the NAIC at the regulatory group ' s winter meeting in Atlanta this December . - - Douglas Brown , 212 - 859 - 1662

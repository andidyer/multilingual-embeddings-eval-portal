" Our market was slightly on the positive side , " said Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri . " BHP is probably the significant mover which has kept the market in the positive , " he added , noting that the A $ 18 . 50 ( US $ 14 . 25 ) level was a key one in the May series of BHP options , helping generate much of the bellwether ' s support on the day . " You ' ve got options expiry with A $ 18 . 50 a relevant strike . " BHP shares ended 1 . 1 percent or 21 cents higher at A $ 18 . 60 . Some switching from rival miner CRA , which lost 30 cents to A $ 21 . 50 , also boosted the market leader .

The company upgraded its reserve estimates at the Cornea oil field off the coast of Western Australia . In the industrials , Australia ' s largest retailer Coles Myer slumped to below A $ 6 . 00 at its intraday low before ending 3 . 7 percent lower at A $ 6 . 07 . Brokers said the company ' s annual analysts briefing on Wednesday had generated the strong selling with 6 . 1 million shares traded . Television operator Seven Network closed at a record high A $ 5 . 35 amid speculation about cross - media rule changes . Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about six to five , while about 29 percent of stocks traded remained steady . ( A $ 1 = US $ 0 . 77 )

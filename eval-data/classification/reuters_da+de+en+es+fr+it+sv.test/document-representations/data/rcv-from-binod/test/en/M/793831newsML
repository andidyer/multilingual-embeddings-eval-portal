FOCUS - Malaysian markets mostly down on ringgit . Malaysian financial markets were at the mercy of a falling ringgit for the second day on Tuesday when the currency neared its lowest level in its trading history against the dollar . Market watchers gasped as the ringgit hit a 42 - month low of 2 . 7930 against the dollar in early trading on Tuesday . Should the ringgit fall to 2 . 80 , it would be the lowest level for the currency since being officially floated against the dollar in 1973 , money market dealers said . " After recent moves , few would stick their necks out to call for a top at 2 . 80 , " said research house MMS International in its market commentary . " ( But ) given that sentiments are overwhelmingly against the ringgit , and the regionals as well , the financial market may well be tempted to create a piece of history , " it said . Said one dealer with a U . S . bank : " We ' re staring at 2 . 80 now . And after that , I have no idea where it could go . " The ringgit , like other Southeast Asian currencies , has been hit by speculative attacks over the past month , losing nearly 12 percent of its value . The currency has remained under selling pressure since plunging two percent late on Friday shortly after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he was satisfied with the ringgit ' s level . Dealers said the remarks were taken to mean that the central bank would allow the ringgit to find its own level and would not intervene to stop the slide . Share prices shrunk further on Tuesday after Monday ' s 3 . 24 percent fall . Blue - chip shares slid perilously close to four - year lows before local institutions came in to buy . The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index of 100 large - capitalised stocks closed 4 . 89 points or 0 . 54 percent lower at 897 . 25 . " Our main worry is the currency , that the ringgit will weaken , " said the managing director of a Japanese investment fund in Singapore . The ringgit recouped some of its early losses to close at 2 . 7645 in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday . Despite the recovery , the currency remained vulnerable , said dealers . A Reuter poll on Tuesday also showed many analysts were worried about the economy . The poll of 12 research houses showed an average forecast of economic growth slowing to 7 . 9 percent in 1997 , against a growth rate of 8 . 2 percent in 1996 . " Since interest rates are so high , it is indicating inflationary pressure and that growth will be sluggish , " said the Japanese fund manager . But Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange executive chairman Nik Mohamad Din Nik Yusoff rejected that notion , blaming the market ' s dismal performance squarely on the ringgit . " There is nothing wrong with the economy . That is why I urge people to go into the market to buy now , " he said earlier on Tuesday . Fund manager Jardine Fleming agreed with him . " From a fundamental perspective now is a good time to be a cash buyer of this market , " said Simon Crinage , chief executive of Jardine Fleming Apex Unit Trusts Bhd . " You have a market that is trading at a prospective earnings of 13 . 7 times . In 1986 , when Malaysia had a negative GDP growth of one percent , this market was trading on 15 times ( price - to - earnings ratio ) , " he said . In commodities , the benchmark October palm oil futures fell five ringgit to 1 , 235 ringgit a tonne . But the spot price of tin hit a seven - month high of 14 . 86 ringgit while rubber prices rose between 1 . 0 and 1 . 50 cents to an average of 248 cents for the main grades . - - Kuala Lumpur newsroom ( 603 ) 275 - 67833 ; fax ( 603 ) 232 - 6752 - - E - mail : kuala . lumpur . newsroom @ reuters . com

Colombia ups budget to pay public sector wage hike . BOGOTA , April 29 Reuter - The Colombian government said Tuesday it would add 903 billion pesos to the national budget , largely to pay for unanticipated public sector pay deals . The 1997 budget was set at 30 trillion pesos and made provision for a weighted pay hike for state workers of 13 . 5 percent . The government was , however , forced to loosen the public purse strings in February in the face of a week - long public sector strike in which the workers won a deal for a maximum 20 percent salary increase , coupled with improved work - related benefits packages . A source at the National Planning Department said the budget addition would not fuel the government ' s burgeoning fiscal deficit , which ran at more than four percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) last year . The funds will be drawn from the profits of publicly - owned companies which amounted to 7 . 9 trillion pesos last year . " The government will present an addition of 903 billion pesos to the budget with the aim of fulfilling wage deals agreed with state sector unions in the course of this year , " a statement from the National Planning Department said . Part of the 903 billion peso package will also be used for debt servicing and investment in the power generating sector . The National Planning Department did not specify how much . The National Planning Department statement also announced the government would spend a further 460 billion pesos of public company profits on modernizing the energy industry , largely power companies suffering from structural and administrative shortcomings .

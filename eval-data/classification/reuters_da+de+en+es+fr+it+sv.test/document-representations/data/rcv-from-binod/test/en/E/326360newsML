INSTANT VIEW - UK December retail sales data . Following is a selection of economists ' reactions to data showing UK December retail sales fell 0 . 8 percent m / m and up 2 . 9 pct y / y . The consensus forecast was for a 0 . 1 percent rise m / m and a 3 . 5 pct rise y / y . STEPHEN HANNAH , IBJ INTERNATIONAL " Obviously considerably weaker than expected . Looking at the underlying picture , up 0 . 9 % on the quarter , 3 . 6 % year on year - - we had been hoping for around a four percent figure , so there is some evidence of a weakening of the trend . " " I would caution that this December figure can often be distorted by minor variations in seasonal patterns . Obviously this does provide the Chancellor with a further excuse for not raising interest rates at this stage . " JEREMY HAWKINS , BANK OF AMERICA " Much weaker than even the British Retail Consortium and CBI surveys intimated . Indeed the 0 . 8 pct fall in the headline index would have been larger still but for a bounce in spending on food . Non - food sales were off a chunky 1 . 7 percent . Probably of most interest is the clothing and footwear sector , which saw a remarkable 4 . 6 percent slump . This is significant since the previous two months saw sizeable price hikes and were a major factor for doubting the the Chancellor ' s 2 . 5 percent RPIX target . " " These data suggest that the consumer is still not prepared to accept significant price increases . This argues against any marked deterioration in the inflation outlook even if , as seems likely , the December slide in sales proves just a temporary phenomenon . Looking ahead , there is good reason for supposing that consumer deman will pick up again . " JOHN SHEPPERD , YAMAICHI " Surprising . Notwithstanding the evidence from the CBI and the BRC , sitll weaker than one might have thought . . . One suspects the market ' s confidence that rates are going up before the election must increasingly be called into question . A lot still hangs on the Q4 GDP numbers . The quarter - on - quarter rise in retail sales was 0 . 9 % , so the trend is still reasonably firm . But if the Chancellor is looking for excuses not to put rates up before the election , then the recent accumulation of data has gone very much his way and this is another strong piece of ammunition for him in arguing against a rate rise . " MARIAN BELL , ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND " We had expected the official series to show soft December UK retail sales , but the 0 . 8 pct m / m fall , taking y / y growth down to 2 . 9 pct , was substantially weaker than either our or the market forecast - - strongly gilt and short sterling positive , sterling negative . However , Q4 spending was still up 3 . 6 percent y / y and we look for a strong January y / y rebound , reflecting seasonal adjustment problems and base effects .

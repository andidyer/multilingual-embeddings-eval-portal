Elek - Tek in violation of lending covenants . Elek - Tek Inc said as a result of a fourth - quarter loss it reported Friday the company is in violation of covenants of the lending agreement with its principal lenders . The marketer of major brand microcomputer products said it is working closely with the banks to bring it into compliance with the banks ' requirements . For the fourth quarter , Elek - Tek reported a loss of $ 4 million or $ 0 . 63 per share compared to a year - earlier loss of $ 1 . 3 million or $ 0 . 21 per share . Sales in the quarter declined to $ 84 . 9 million from $ 96 . 2 million . Elek - Tek said it took an additional $ 600 , 000 in pre - tax special charges during the fourth quarter . These charges reflect increases in reserves related to disputed balances . The company previously had reported recognition of $ 6 . 4 million in pre - tax special charges during the second quarter . It also had increased its reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable by $ 900 , 000 . Corporate sales in the fourth quarter showed a 13 percent increase over the comparable quarter in 1995 . But Elek - Tek said it believes the retail computer market was depressed during the fourth quarter because many consumers deferred PC purchases in anticipation of new technology introductions during 1997 . It said retail sales fell short of last year ' s results by 24 percent , and catalog / mail order sales dropped by 20 percent . Excluding the impact of the charges , Elek - Tek said its gross margins improved in the quarter to 12 . 6 percent from 12 . 2 percent last year despite heavy seasonal discounting in the retail channel . It said operating expenses for the quarter were $ 11 . 6 million , down by $ 1 . 5 million from the same year - ago period . Besides the $ 600 , 000 million pre - tax special charges and the $ 900 , 000 increase in reserves for accounts receivable , estimated future tax benefits were reduced , which resulted in a net fourth - quarter tax expenseof $ 1 . 9 million , Elek - Tek said .

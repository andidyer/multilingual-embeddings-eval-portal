Czech crown impact seen limited in Eastern Europe . Intense downward pressure on the Czech crown in recent days is unlikely to spill over to other Eastern European countries with different economic fundamentals and exchange rate regimes , analysts said on Tuesday . Speculative selling of the Czech crown in the past week has forced the central bank to intervene for the first time in more than a year , driving interest rates sharply higher . The crown currency of neighbouring Slovakia , whose economy is closely tied to that of the Czech Republic and faces broadly similar problems , has been buffeted in the turmoil . But analysts said other East European currencies should be largely immune . " I would not see any impact in Poland or Hungary . They have different fiscal policies and fiscal situations than the Czech Republic , " said Jan Pudil , head of Prague brokers WoodCommerz . The crown has been under pressure mainly on selling by foreign investors initially alarmed by the yawning Czech current account deficit of around nine percent of gross domestic product , and a steep drop in industrial output . The crown nosedived last week to a record five percent below the midpoint of the dollar / mark basket which the central bank uses to fix its exchange rate daily . The central bank took several steps to curb short - selling including raising the Lombard rate to 50 percent . Late on Tuesday , it stood at 1 . 65 percent below parity . The Czech central bank has said the crown pressure is not linked to domestic economic fundamentals but to turbulence on financial markets abroad . " For the Czech Republic , Thailand was clearly the spark , " said David Lubin , emerging markets economist at HSBC Midland in London . The Thai baht came under severe pressure last week and the central bank was also forced to impose sky - high interest rates . But analysts did not see any risk of similar turmoil hitting other East European countries . " Neighbouring markets are in a different position , except for Slovakia , " Pudil said . " The ( Czech and Slovak ) economies are linked and the current account deficit is there . " The Czech and Slovak republics were united until the Czechoslovak federation broke up at the end of 1992 . The currency split early in 1993 . The Slovak crown , which came under selling pressure late last week , weakened sharply in nervous trading early on Tuesday before strengthening on a stronger central bank fixing . Dealers say the pressure on the Slovak currency is linked to events in the Czech Republic but there have also been signs of some movement in recent weeks out of Czech crowns and into Slovak crowns . " Some people had been short Czech and long Slovak , which in retrospect was a clever thing to do , " said Lubin , adding that variations in the Slovak exchange rate have been far smaller than in the Czech crown . However , analysts said the other leading East European emerging markets , Hungary and Poland , faced very different circumstances . " There are no big imbalances in the Hungarian economy . In Poland , although the trade deficit is growing very sharply , it is still by no means at the threatening level in terms of its share of GDP , " Lubin said . Poland ' s current account deficit was just one percent of GDP last year and is expected to grow to 3 - 3 . 5 percent in 1997 . " Polish fundamentals are much better than Czech , so nothing similar to what happened to the crown should happen to the zloty , " said Wojciech Kowalczyk , dealer at Bank Handlowy SA .

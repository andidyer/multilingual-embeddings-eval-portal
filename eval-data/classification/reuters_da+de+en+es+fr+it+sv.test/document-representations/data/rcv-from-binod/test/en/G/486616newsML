SOCCER - MIDDLESBROUGH LEAGUE CUP FINAL SQUAD PENPIX . Pen pictures of the Middlesbrough players likely to comprise the squad for the League Cup final against Leicester City at Wembley on Sunday : Mark Schwarzer , goalkeeper , 24 . Australian signed by Middlesbrough from Bradford City for 1 . 25 million pounds ( $ 2 million ) in February in time to play in the semifinal against Stockport . Was at Kaiserslautern and Dynamo Dresden in Germany but watched from the sidelines as Kaiserslautern won the German Cup last season . Neil Cox , defender , 26 . Former Aston Villa defender who was one of Bryan Robson ' s first buys for Boro . Has proved to be an astute purchase with a series of steady performances based on speed and accurate crossing . Derek Whyte , defender , 28 . Tall Scottish international who began his career with Celtic before moving to Boro in 1992 . Has made over 150 appearances but recently lost his place and may have to be content with a place on the bench . Nigel Pearson , defender , 33 . Played in Sheffield Wednesday ' s winning 1991 League Cup final team . Started his career at Shrewsbury in 1981 , moving to Wednesday in 1987 and Boro in July 1994 . Now club skipper . Curtis Fleming , defender , 27 . Adventurous full - back who loves to get in the opponents ' box . A fearsome tackler who has played for Ireland , he joined the club in 1991 from St Patricks Athletic . Steve Vickers , defender , 29 . Started his career in non - League football with Spennymoor before moving to Tranmere . Has made nearly 150 appearances for Boro and was voted the club ' s Player of the Season last season but has lost his place since the arrival of Gianluca Festa . Phil Whelan , defender , 25 . Tall defender who struggled to make an mpact at Boro since his move from Ipswich in 1995 . Injury and suspension saw him complete a stop - start 1995 - 96 season and has made only 11 appearances this season . Gianluca Festa , defender , 28 . Italian who has added steel to the Boro defence since his 2 . 7 million pounds ( $ 4 . 4 million ) move from Inter Milan in January . Looks capable of coping with typically strong English forwards and is also comfortable on the ball . Vladimir Kinder , defender , 28 . The least well - known of Bryan Robson ' s foreign signings . The Slovakian international was signed from Slovan Bratislava for 1 . 0 million pounds ( $ 1 . 64 million ) in January as Robson tried to improve his leaking defence . He has been unable to hold down a first team slot and has yet to fulfill his promise . Emerson , midfielder , 24 . Powerful , skilled player who has achieved star status since his 4 . 0 million pounds ( $ 6 . 5 million ) move from Porto . Early season unrest lead to him twice walking out on the club before being persuaded to return . On his day he runs the midfield for Boro like Robson did for Manchester United . Juninho , midfielder , 24 . The outstanding Brazilian can unlock the tightest defence with his dribbling ability and inch - perfect passing . Has shown he is a man for the big occasion and proved he can handle the rough stuff . Will love the wide open spaces and the perfect pitch at Wembley where he scored for Brazil against England in 1995 . Robbie Mustoe , midfielder , 28 . In the absence of Emerson has been used as the midfield enforcer . The former Oxford player has also been known to pop up with the odd goal at crucial times . Craig Hignett , midfielder / forward , 27 . Surprised many by surviving the arrival of Juninho and seeing off Nick Barmby . Tireless worker , adds some variety down the Boro flanks and loves to get involved in sweeping passing movements . Alan Moore , forward , 22 . Ireland international seemed set for stardom when he burst onto the scene in Boro ' s promotion campaign of 1994 - 95 . But the few chances given by Bryan Robson last season seems to have affected his confidence . Has played more matches this season , but not the threat he was . Clayton Blackmore , midfielder , 32 . Versatile midfielder and a former playing colleague of Robson at Manchester United . Likely to be on the bench , but has experience of Wembley from his Manchester United days . His Boro career seemed over earlier this season when Robson loaned him out to Bristol City . But has featured prominently since his return . Phil Stamp , midfielder , 21 . A tenacious player who has recently been called up to the England under - 21 squad . He helps Emerson run the midfield and gives Juninho the space to play . Fabrizio Ravanelli , striker , 28 . Joined Middlesbrough for 7 . 0 million pounds ( $ 11 . 5 million ) from Juventus in the summer in one of the truly memorable transfer deals of all time . Scored 41 goals in four seasons for Juve , including one in the European Cup final in May . Scored a hat - trick on his debut against Liverpool in August and looks to have recovered from injury in time to play . The Italian international seems to spend his time either moaning about his team mates or finding the net - - but he knows all about big cup finals and will be a key player . Mikkel Beck , striker , 24 . Danish striker who has started to find his feet in recent games . Battled long and hard to sort out contractual problems at Cologne so he could join Boro , and has worked just as hard to gain a first team place . A pacey foil to Ravanelli . Bryan Robson , Manager , 40 . Former England and Manchester United captain Robson was appointed Middlesbrough manager in May 1994 and took them into the premier league in his first season . Won 90 caps for England , the league , three F . A . Cups and the European Cup Winners Cup with United . Still registered as a player , making his most recent appearance - - and his only one this season - - against Aresenal on New Years Day .

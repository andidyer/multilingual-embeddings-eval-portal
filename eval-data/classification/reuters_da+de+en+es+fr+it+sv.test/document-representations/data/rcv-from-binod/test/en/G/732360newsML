EPA unveils final new air pollution standards . Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner Wednesday signed controversial new air pollution control rules that have been hailed by health groups and criticised by industry and local governments . " These new updated air quality standards are the next step in fulfilling the vision of the Clean Air Act , which directs us to set standards that protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety based on the latest , best - available science , " Browner said at a White House ceremony announcing the final rules . The ceremony prompted opponents of the new standards to hold their own event on Capitol Hill . The bipartisan group of House members , mostly from the industrial Midwest and Ohio Valley , said their bill to stall the new rules had 55 co - sponsors and would be acted on quickly . " Newt told me again today this bill is going to move . I think it ' s going to be on a relatively fast track , " Michigan Republican Representative Fred Upton said , referring to House Speaker Newt Gingrich . House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley of Virginia said he would co - sponsor the bill " in the hope of giving the debate a jump start . " A similar measure was expected to be offered in the Senate , and two - thirds majorities in both chambers would be needed to override an expected White House veto . " Like others , Democrats and Republican alike , I have been increasingly frustrated by the EPA ' s failure to justify these proposals , and the government ' s unwillingness to come forward with the information America needs to form an intelligent opinion , " Bliley said in a statement . But Browner said the rules would prevent about 350 , 000 cases of aggravated asthma and result in easier breathing for millions of children . Industry and local governments have criticised the new standards for smog , or ozone , and particulate matter , or soot , as too costly . Under the plan , major producers of smog and soot such as big power plants would be required to reduce their emissions and areas violating the rules would be punished . In response to some of the criticisms , the EPA changed the standards for ozone in the final rule to make it easier for businesses and local communities to be in compliance by allowing more " bad air " days . Also , the amount of particulate matter allowed in the air was raised in the final rules , the EPA said . " We ' ve developed a plan to implement these new standards in the most flexible common - sense and cost - effective ways so that they will deliver both cleaner air and continued economic progress , " Gore said at the White House event . " Communities and businesses will be afforded ample time to reduce pollution and bring themselves into compliance , " he added . " States are now working together to reduce pollutants that originate in one area and affect cities located far downwind . " The rules are set to take effect in 60 days , but they will not require local controls for ozone until 2004 and for soot until 2005 . Compliance will not be enforced until 2007 for ozone and 2008 for soot and extensions are possible , EPA said . The EPA said Tuesday that nationwide some 280 counties will fail to meet the new limits on ozone and 150 counties will fail to meet its soot standards . The numbers are lower than had been predicted by industry groups battling the new standards . Under current standards , 106 counties are out of compliance with smog limits and 41 counties are violating limits on particulate matter .

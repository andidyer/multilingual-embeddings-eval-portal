Russian soldier kills 10 , then himself . A Russian sergeant killed 10 of his fellow servicemen in a peacekeeping unit in Georgia ' s breakaway region of Abkhazia and then committed suicide , sources with the Russian military in the Georgian capital said on Monday . The sources said several other soldiers were wounded . Russia ' s defence ministry in Moscow confirmed that the incident had taken place but gave no details or death toll . Interfax news agency said the sergeant , whom it named as Artur Vaganov , had run amok early on Sunday . Russian troops act as peacekeepers in a zone separating Georgia from its Black Sea province of Abkhazia . Abkhazia has run itself as a de - facto independent state since routing Georgian forces out in 1993 . Incidents of this nature have become sadly common in recent years in the former Soviet Union as low morale and cash shortages take their toll on Moscow ' s once - mighty military machine .

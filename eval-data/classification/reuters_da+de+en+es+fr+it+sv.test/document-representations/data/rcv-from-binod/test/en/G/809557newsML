U . S . shuttle returns with ozone satellite . The space shuttle Discovery touched down in Florida on Tuesday with a satellite carrying a bounty of data about the health of Earth ' s protective ozone layer . Passing a full moon in the blue morning sky , the $ 2 billion gliding spaceship set down at 7 : 08 a . m . EDT ( 1108 GMT ) on its landing strip at the Kennedy Space Center . " Discovery , welcome home , this looked like a perfect mission from start to finish , " mission control ' s Dom Gorie radioed as Discovery stopped on the runway . Cradled in the shuttle ' s cargo bay was an ozone - monitoring satellite , holding enough atmospheric data to fill a half ton of computer floppy disks . The German - built spacecraft flew free of the shuttle for nine days and took nearly 50 , 000 atmospheric measurements to aid scientists studying the depletion of the ozone layer . The satellite also provided evidence to support a controversial theory that the Earth is being bombarded daily by thousands of house - sized , water - laden comets . The threat of fog had delayed Discovery ' s homecoming by a day , but the weather cooperated for the sole landing opportunity on Tuesday . The shuttle made a rare southerly approach to the Florida spaceport , entering the atmosphere over the South Pacific , passing high over the Yucatan Peninsula , and crossing the Gulf of Mexico west of Cuba . The shuttle entered U . S . air space south of Tampa Bay and shook the central Florida area with double sonic booms . The shuttle ' s crew of six , which includes a Canadian researcher , had a jam - packed 12 - day mission . In addition to setting free the ozone - monitoring satellite and returning to pick it up later , the astronauts worked on 24 other major objectives . They tested a Japanese prototype robot arm for the planned international space station , grew colon cancer cells for medical research and pointed a telescope at Comet Hale - Bopp as it raced away from the sun . NASA officials hailed Discovery ' s mission as complete success . " The activities on the flight went extremely well , " shuttle program manager Tommy Holloway said . Attention at the Kennedy Space Center now turns to shuttle Atlantis , which is being prepared for a flight to Russia ' s ailing Mir space station . NASA spokesman Joel Wells said a launch pad accident on Monday was not expected to delay the shuttle ' s planned Sept . 25 blastoff . A cargo bay door was damaged soon after the shuttle arrived at the launch pad on Monday . The 60 - ft long structure was jarred as it scraped against a work platform . An insulating blanket was torn and engineers were checking the door and its hinges for other signs of damage .

UK ' s Clarke not to use Europe in leadership race . Kenneth Clarke , until today Britain ' s Chancellor of the Exchequer , said on Friday he intended to stand for leadership of his party but would not run on the issue of Europe . Asked if his campaign would be based on Europe , Clarke told BBC radio , Clarke said : " No I think it ' s quite obvious the Conservative Party has got to have a free vote on Europe . " " It has been a very , very serious problem at the heart of policy - making and indiscipline in the party , " Clarke said . He said it could be five or even 10 years before the Conservative Party regained power . He said the surviving Conservative MPs " must put an immediate end to all the divisions . " Clarke , the most pro - European member of Prime Minister John Major ' s cabinet , has been blamed by some Eurosceptic Conservatives for blocking an outright rejection of membership of a single European currency . - - Mike Peacock , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5109

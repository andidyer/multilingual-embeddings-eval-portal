Zairean rebels agree to humanitarian corridor . Zairean rebels have agreed to open up a humanitarian corridor to reach more than a million Rwandan and Burundian refugees trapped and scattered by fighting in eastern Zaire , a U . N . official said on Sunday . Omar Backhet , resident representative of the U . N . Development Programme ( UNDP ) in Rwanda , told Reuters the first assessment teams to check on humanitarian needs and security would enter rebel - held eastern Zaire on Monday . " We have reached an agreement with them ( rebels ) and we ' ll be sending in assessment teams first thing tomorrow . The teams will be made up of non - governmental agencies and within a day or two U . N . agencies should be able to go in as well , " Backhet said . Backhet spoke shortly after U . N . special envoy Raymond Chretien returned to the Rwandan capital on a mission he said was aimed at narrowing differences between Rwanda and Zaire on the war in eastern Zaire . " I have returned to Rwanda so that I can narrow differences between the Zairean and Rwandan governments , " Chretien told a news conference . Rwanda is opposed to French participation in a proposed U . N . humanitarian force to police the battle zone of eastern Zaire and open up corridors for dying and starving refugees who fled fighting between rebels and Zaire ' s ragged army . The medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres ( MSF - Doctors without Borders ) said earlier on Sunday that Rwanda had authorised aid agencies to deliver food and medicines from its territory to the rebel - held east . The agreement by Rwanda was a major climbdown for a government that had previously insisted that food aid and medicines be distributed inside the tiny Central African country to returning refugees . MSF spokeswoman Samantha Boulton told Reuters the situation was particularly desperate for some 750 , 000 Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped in the fighting outside the city of Goma , many of them in the vast refugee camp of Mugunga where armed Hutu rebels are holding out . She said the United Nations was seeking permission from the governments of both Rwanda and Zaire to deliver food and medicines to the refugees . European Commissioner Emma Bonino was expected in Kigali early on Monday . She will be arriving from Kinshasa where the government has ruled out safe havens for the refugees who first arrived in 1994 after fleeing an ethnic war and genocidal killings , which many of them took part in . Zaire accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels but Kigali strongly denies this , saying the rebellion in eastern Zaire was an internal matter . Aid agencies say hungry and thirsty Burundian and Rwandan Hutus must be helped wherever they are , on the mountainsides or barren lava fields of inhospitable eastern Zaire .

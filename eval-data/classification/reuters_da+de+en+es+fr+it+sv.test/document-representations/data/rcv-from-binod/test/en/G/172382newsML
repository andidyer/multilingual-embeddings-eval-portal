Russian PM may meet Chechen leaders this month . Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin may meet leaders of breakaway Chechnya this month to inject new momentum into the peace process in the region , a senior Kremlin official said on Thursday . Boris Berezovsky , appointed last week as deputy head of the influential Security Council , said Chernomyrdin would meet rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and other Chechen officials soon , maybe this month . " At the centre of this meeting will be the development of the peace process , " Berezovsky told Russian television . Berezovsky met Movladi Udugov , first deputy prime minister of the self - declared separatist Chechen government , in the capital of the neighbouring North Caucasus region of Ingushetia . The 20 - month Chechen war was halted in August after former Security Council secretary Alexander Lebed , later sacked by President Boris Yeltsin , signed a peace deal with the rebel leadership following a flare - up in fighting . Berezovsky said he and Udugov , the separatists ' chief spokesman , also discussed economic matters . " We want to create a realistic basis for a civilised market economy , " Berezovsky said . Berezovsky ' s appointment to the Security Council , an advisory body of state leaders and security chiefs , angered the opposition Communists as they said the 50 - year - old businessman did not have the experience needed . Chernomyrdin and Yandarbiyev signed a detailed new peace accord in Moscow on October 3 . It laid the framework for cooperation between the two sides in rebuilding the Chechen economy and paving the way for new elections . ORT television said on Thursday that Doku Zavgayev , the Moscow - backed Chechen leader who won a flawed election last December , was prepared to stand down . Zavgayev has been sidelined by direct talks between Moscow and the rebels .

S . Africa rand / bonds closing report . It was a panicky late session on the South African forex market on Friday as the rand was hit by importer and speculator dollar demand which pummelled it through the 4 . 63 level against a rampant U . S . currency . Forex traders said dollar demand triggered stop losses at 4 . 62 , enabling the unit to easily breach 4 . 6250 on the way up , bringing the rand ' s losses to eight cents since the start of the week and to a fresh six - and - a - half month low . The bond market also took fright on the sickly currency and a freefall on the U . S . Treasury market where the U . S . long bond was down 1 - 1 / 2 full points after a strong National Association of Purchasing Mangement report . Bond yields moved back above the psycholigically important 14 percent figure after moving sideways in a lacklustre morning session . Dealers said a further contributing factor to the rand ' s woes on the day had been the fact that the dollar had firmed to its strongest level since November 1989 when it broke above the 1 . 86 mark level in London on Friday afternoon . At 1430 GMT the rand was changing hands at 4 . 6320 / 6350 against the greenback from 4 . 6085 / 6115 at the local close on Thursday . Forex traders said the Reserve Bank had stepped into the market in the late session first at around 4 . 6150 and then around 4 . 6275 but only to add liquidity and had then staged a quick exit . Until Friday , the central bank had been noticeably absent from the market . " It looks like the bank is wanting it higher without losing too many reserves , " said one trader at a foreign bank . On direction next week , he said the 4 . 65 level was beckoning and should be reached early next week . " From there I would say it has to find some stability , " the dealer added . In cross rate action , the rand was last at 7 . 5818 / 5913 versus sterling from 7 . 5449 / 5522 on Thursday , while against the mark it was last changing hands at 0 . 4004 / 4008 from 0 . 3276 / 3279 previously . It was fetching 25 . 4828 / 5209 against the yen from a previous levels of 25 . 6830 / 7214 . Long bond yields drifted sideways during the morning session but were whipped higher in the afternoon by sharp losses on the U . S . Treasury market in the wake of U . S . data which showed signs of inflationary pressures . Combined with strong July payrolls data , the NAPM data also revived fears about higher interest rates . U . S . stocks also slid , with the Dow Jones index losing around 100 points in the firts hour of trade . At 1430 GMT government ' s benchmark R150 was soft but off its weakest level at 14 . 08 percent from 13 . 96 percent at 1400 GMT on Thursday . " It was a Friday afternoon classic turnaround in a bull market , " commented a senior debt trader . " We came off primarily on the U . S . and the rand but volumes were pretty thin , " he added . Others noted that option books - - ahead of the next Thursday ' s close - out - - had an influence on the volume traded . Dealers said the market was also awaiting the release of July gold and foreign reserves numbers , due at 1600 GMT . Reserves are expected to come in at between 21 . 5 billion rand to 23 . 3 billion rand from 22 . 1 billion rand in June .

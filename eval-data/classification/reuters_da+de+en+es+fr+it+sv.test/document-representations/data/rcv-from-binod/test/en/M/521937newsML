Volume 378 . 5 million , value A $ 1 . 06 bln , 1 , 051 stocks traded , 327 steady , 454 up , 270 down . The Australian share market finished a strong week on a surprising up - note with investors disregarding a lack of firm leads from offshore markets and snapping up a large range of blue chip issues . The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed up 29 . 2 points at 2 , 442 . 4 , just shy of its intra - day high of 2 , 442 . 5 . The June share price index ended 25 points higher at 2 , 438 and at a 4 . 4 point discount to the underlying index . After a slow start the market picked up momentum mid - morning as buyers targeted major resource issues that have lagged the market steady gain of the past few weeks . " Today was a solid day and a bit unexpected . The Papua New Guinea sector , I think , was rerated , " said Scott Healy , a dealer from Brisbane broker , Wilson HTM . A number of PNG stocks were targeted on the day including Lihir Gold Ltd , Orogen Minerals Ltd and Oilsearch Ltd . " There ' s still going to be a bit of a discount for PNG stocks , but there is obviously a bit more faith there , " he said . Healy said although most blue chip stocks made reasonable gains , the surprising factor was the amount of buying interest in second - rung market sectors like insurance and gold . " A lot of the insurance stocks were pretty strong . This sector appears to be the emerging one ( compared to banks ) , " Healy said . Base metals miner MIM was one of the strongest issues on the day after it announced a restructuring of its Queensland coal interest on Thursday . Oil and gas issues were also sought after , with Woodside Petroleum Ltd recovering most of its fall on Thursday after it announced a disappointing drilling result . PNG - based Oilsearch Ltd ended up 16 cents at A $ 3 . 09 on speculation one of its exploration wells had struck oil . Other outstanding issues on the day included gemstone explorer Diamond Rose NL whose stock debuted at a spectacular premium of A $ 1 . 308 to their issue price of 20 cents . The company ' s major assets are tenements from an unlisted company associated with director Pnina Feldman , sister of mining tycoon , Joseph Gutnick . Diamond Rose shares closed at A $ 1 . 293 . PNG gold hopeful Capenter Pacific Resources NL was arguably the most exciting company on the day , its shares ending 19 . 5 cents up at 38 cents after announcing promising drilling results from the Mt Kare gold project which is just 15 kilometres norteast of the giant Porgera gold mine . In other markets , the Australian bond yields ended modestly higher after a more subdued session , as the market squared up after this week ' s strong rally in preparation of Tuesday ' s release of CPI data . The yield on 10 - year T - bonds closed at 7 . 82 percent , up 0 . 03 percentage points from Thursday ' s close . The Australian dollar looked to have found a short term floor Friday as a bounce from two - month lows clawed back a portion of the week ' s two cent loss . At 5 . 50 p . m ( 0750 GMT ) , the local dollar was quoted at US $ 0 . 7751 / 61 compared to Thursday ' s close at US $ 7720 / 25 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( TECHNICALS ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Short - term range Support Restnce RSI - 14 MA - 10 MA - 20AORD 2425 / 2450 2400 2450 72 . 79 2391 2388SPI 2420 / 2450 2395 2460 71 . 56 2381 2377 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - KEY ACTIVES - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * Diamond Rose DRN .

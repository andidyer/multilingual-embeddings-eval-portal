OPINION - Russell Barton ' s Canberra Closeup - A darker shade of blue . By Russell Barton ( ABC TV Political Editor ) Grahame Morris , John Howard ' s chief of staff and key confidante , says the government is just going through " some mid - term blues " . Well , the shade of blue darkened this week , despite the Reserve Bank springing its fifth official rate cut in 12 months . Immediately countering the warm glow of the half a percent reduction , came two sets of gloomy statistics . Building approvals were expected to record at least a modest rise for June . Instead , they fell , seasonally - adjusted , by 4 . 5 percent . Even allowing for the complication created by the inclusion in the May figures of Sydney ' s Olympic village , that was a setback . Retail sales followed a similar pattern . A small increase was expected . A 1 . 8 percent decline was realised , putting the June quarter ' s total down 0 . 5 percent , seasonally adjusted . Retailers ' anecdotes had warned of flat , even declining trading . Consumers are not spending despite the two percentage points reduction in rates , before the latest cut . Politically , as well as economically , the rate cuts have yet to hit home . There ' s respectable political opinion which says that with each cut being presented by some media sources as a response to a sluggish economy - - a line promoted by the Labor opposition - - the government simply isn ' t getting the favourable impact which is supposed to go with the lowest mortgage interest rates for 30 years . At the margin , Treasurer Peter Costello has confused the issue , wittingly or unwittingly . In recent weeks , before the latest reduction , as market analysts steadily moved to unanimity that there would be another Reserve Bank move downwards , Costello appeared distinctly unenthusiastic about the prospect . On at least three occasions , his response to questions about the likelihood of another cut implied that he was not a proponent of such a move . For instance , on the occasion of the June unemployment figures , he responded to interest rate questions this way : " Before anyone gets fixed on the next movement , let ' s just sit back and wait for the previous movements to have the positive effects which they will have . " Of course , there was none of that this week when he was responding to the fifth cut of the latest cycle . It was now " very good news " . " It ' s good news for business . It ' s good news for homebuyers . It ' s the reward for good economic management , " he said . Costello ' s earlier approach had given rise to suggestions that he ' d fixed his political sights about 18 months hence , to the possible monetary conditions which might apply in the lead up to the next election . Given past monetary policy experience , cycles of around 18 months are the norm . In other words , the current round of easing could reasonably be expected to be followed , at around that interval , by the start of the next round of tightening . As the treasurer is no doubt acutely aware , that would be an unwelcome piece of timing . That ' s why yesterday he told the Economic Society of Victoria luncheon quite forcefully : " Having brought them down , we want them to stay down . " ( That , by the way , seems to challenge the concept of Reserve Bank independence . But then politicians always want to be responsible for favourable developments and equally want nothing to do with those less pleasant , such as interest rate rises . ) He also offered an explanation why consumers might not be responding immediately to lower interest rates . " I think the Australian public was very scarred by the experience of the late 1980s , when they saw some of their home mortgage go to 17 percent , business overdrafts go up to 22 percent , " he said . " When the Reserve started tightening at the end of 1994 , there was a , sort of , ' here we go again ' and the public appreciation was probably magnified by the traumatic experience in the late 1980s . What I hope to be able to do is snap out of that thinking in a different qualitative environment . " That different environment , he hopes , will continue to deliver low inflation and enable the government to avoid the discomfort of having rates rising at election time . But that political concern has also apparently led to his ambivalence towards too much easing now , which might increase the risk of too much tightening later on . Overlaying the public ' s response to interest cuts and consumer spending patterns , of course , is unemployment . Job insecurity is now mentioned in every qualitative poll carried out , and at the top of the list of concerns . Everywhere , there is downsizing - - the public sector , semi - government agencies and corporations are seized by the search for a smaller workforce . Next Tuesday ' s special cabinet meeting will be under considerable pressure , therefore , to come up with some practical moves . The meeting already could have lost some of its political punch with the likely absence of the prime minister , who will probably be continuing his recuperation at Kirribilli House . Industry Minister John Moore and Communications Minister Richard Alston won ' t be there either . The remainder should be in no doubt about the importance the electorate places on this issue . It will fail politically unless there ' s credible and urgent action . - - Canberra Bureau 61 - 6 273 - 2730

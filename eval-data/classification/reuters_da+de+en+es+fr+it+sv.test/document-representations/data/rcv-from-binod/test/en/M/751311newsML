LME copper may face fund selling - - Asian traders . Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) may be pressured by fund selling , amid disappointment that benchmark three - month copper failed to recover to $ 2 , 365 - 70 per tonne during a recent probe of the upside , Asian traders said on Wednesday . " We might see stop - loss selling today . Three - month copper has failed to rebound to $ 2 , 365 / 70 , " said a trader at one of Japan ' s major trading houses . " If it breaches support at $ 2 , 285 , it will fall further towards $ 2 , 200 . " Traders were looking for further clues to the market ' s direction from the cash / threes backwardation and whether it would narrow further to less than $ 100 after hitting $ 270 last week . The wide backwardation had given support to prices , which otherwise looked weak as the Northern Hemisphere entered the summer holiday season , they said . " We had expected the spread to narrow to $ 100 . If it falls below $ 100 , as it did briefly yesterday , we have to review our view on the market , " one trader said . Traders said the rise in LME copper stocks towards the psychologically key 200 , 000 - tonne mark had been expected , and they predicted stock levels would rise further towards 230 , 000 tonnes in August . By 0230 GMT , three - month copper was quoted at $ 2 , 295 / $ 2 , 300 a tonne , compared with $ 2 , 297 / 2 , 298 at 1800 GMT on Tuesday and Tuesday ' s kerb close at $ 2 , 300 . Zinc stood at $ 1 , 549 / $ 1 , 554 a tonne , compared with $ 1 , 546 / 1 , 550 and $ 1 , 544 . Traders agreed zinc remained strong after a climb overnight to $ 1 , 545 , a fresh seven - year high , before giving up $ 1 by the end of the kerb in London . " I can ' t see a large fall ( in zinc prices ) before the end of September . Consumers have not bought the metal so far , as they had hoped prices would come down again , " said one trader . Another trader added : " We ' re reaching the target of $ 1 , 550 , but after a small dip of $ 20 - $ 30 , it could resume its upward move . Next resistance on the charts is $ 1 , 588 , but it ' s difficult to say where the next traget is . " Traders expected aluminium to remain in its recent range of $ 1 , 570 to $ 1 , 630 a tonne in the short term . Three month aluminium was quoted at $ 1 , 619 / $ 1 , 623 at 1430 GMT , compared with Tuesday ' s kerb close at $ 1 , 615 . - - Tokyo Commodities + 81 - 3 - 3432 - 6179

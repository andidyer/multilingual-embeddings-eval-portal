Solectron says on stream for FY97 estimates . Solectron Corp Vice President of Finance Dick Gilpin said the company remains " on - stream " to meet Wall Street earnings estimates for its second quarter to the end of February and for fiscal 1997 . " We ' re basically saying we ' ll be on stream with what Street expectations were for the year as well as for next quarter , " Gilpin told Reuters . Specifically , he said the First Call consensus earnings estimate of $ 2 . 75 a share for fiscal 1997 was " reasonable " and the company was comfortable with the First Call mean estimate of $ 0 . 65 earnings per share for the second quarter . Solectron provides advanced manufacturing services to makers of electronic systems , ranging from personal computers and workstations to highly - complex test and instrumentation equipment and printers . Gilpin reiterated that the company is still planning to increase the mix of its business that includes building complete " boxes , " rather than just the electronic boards , over the next two to three years . The box - building segment has traditionally been around seven to eight percent of Solectron ' s overall business and has risen to 12 percent in the company ' s first fiscal quarter which ended on November 29 . " We expect to ramp that up over the next two to three years to where it will be 30 to 50 percent of our revenue over next two to three years , " he said , adding this was consistent with Solectron ' s recent plans but the company was providing no further guidance on how quickly this shift would occur . The executive said that although the business is a lower margin activity , it is a rapidly growing area and the company expects to can maintain its return on investment levels through higher asset utilization and inventory turn levels . " We anticipate 20 percent after - tax return on equity , " said Gilpin , adding this was consistent with historic levels . " You get much higher asset utilization if you manage it properly . Your return on investment is about the same if you manage it right - - very high inventory turns , " he said of the business of manufacturing complete products . Solectron reported after the market close Monday its net income per share in the first quarter rose to $ 0 . 58 , including non - recurring charges of around $ 0 . 05 a share , up from $ 0 . 54 a year earlier on a fully - diluted basis . The share was off 3 - 5 / 8 at 54 - 1 / 4 in late trading after slipping as low as 52 - 5 / 8 earlier . Alex . Brown said earlier it had downgraded Solectron to a neutral rating from a buy . - - sam . perry @ reuters . com , Palo Alto Bureau + 1 415 846 5400

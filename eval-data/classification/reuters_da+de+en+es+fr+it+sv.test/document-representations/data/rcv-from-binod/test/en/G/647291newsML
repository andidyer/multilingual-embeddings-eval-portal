France reinforces Congo , evacuates nationals . France ' s new left - wing government , meeting its first overseas crisis , rushed 800 extra troops to Brazzaville on Monday and evacuated hundreds of French citizens to escape fighting between political and ethnic militias . The junior co - operation minister , Charles Josselin , said on television that he aimed to change the way France operates in Africa , ending a tradition of influence through semi - clandestine Gaullist networks . Josselin , a Socialist whose brief is relations with former French possessions in the Third World , said French troops in Congo - Brazzaville would remain impartial " for the time being " and their sole mission was to protect French residents and other foreigners . He said government and rebels were both to blame for the breakdown of order , and blamed the Gaullist networks for France ' s slipping position in Africa . " They already have a very large part of responsibility for France being on the wrong side in Zaire . . . and the death of Jacques Foccart ( veteran Gaullist string - puller in Africa who died in March ) is an opportunity we must seize to change this situation , " Josselin told LCI television . A Defence Ministry spokeswoman said the reinforcements , half from mainland France and half from Chad , would take the number of French soldiers in Brazzaville to 1 , 200 . Amid reports of hostility towards French nationals , 460 French residents were flown to Libreville , in neighbouring Gabon , and 100 more were to be evacuated later in the day . Paris announced it was sending 500 extra troops after a French soldier was killed and five were wounded in a clash with local irregulars while rescuing foreigners . It boosted the number of reinforcements after heavy fighting resumed between forces loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and ex - president Denis Sassou Nguesso ' s militia . Sassou Nguesso , speaking to LCI from Brazzaville , placed the blame for fighting on pro - government militias which he said were trained by Israeli mercenaries . He denied any anti - French feelings among his partisans and said French casualties resulted from government fire . He said he still hoped elections , scheduled for July , would take place and welcomed foreign mediation offers , including from Gabon President Omar Bongo and South African President Nelson Mandela . Josselin said France placed little hope in the offers which he said were " too vague . " Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took office only last week , and the fighting provided a first test of his government and " cohabitation " with conservative President Jacques Chirac . Analysts said Chirac and Jospin would be keen to present a united front in a crisis endangering French lives , but differences on African policy were likely to emerge later . The crisis in the Republic of Congo , following the overthrow of ally Mobutu Sese Seko in neighbouring Zaire which has since been renamed Democratic Republic of Congo , raised fears that other French - speaking African states could be destabilised . Oil - rich neighbours Congo and Gabon , bordering the Central African Republic , a key staging post for French troops in Africa , form a key region for Paris ' strategic interests on the continent . Some African experts have evoked a " domino theory " , forecasting that the upheaval in Zaire would spill over into its neighbours and destabilise the former French colonies .

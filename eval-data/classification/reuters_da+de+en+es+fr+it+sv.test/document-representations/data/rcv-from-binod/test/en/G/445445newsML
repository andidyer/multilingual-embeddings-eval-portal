SOCCER - UNITED STATES BEAT CANANA IN WORLD CUP QUALIFIER . The Americans found their scoring touch Sunday , beating Canada 3 - 0 in a CONCACAF regional group World Cup qualifying match . The win gave the United States four points from two matches , level with Mexico , who were held to a goalless draw in Costa Rica earlier on Sunday . Three of the six teams in the Central and North America and Caribbean group will advance to the World Cup finals next year in France . " I feel like we are slowly making progress , " said U . S . coach Steve Sampson , whose team failed to score in its first qualifying match , a 0 - 0 tie with Jamaica . " At times our play was very good and other times it was inconsistent , but we got three points , " he said after the game at Stanford University stadium . Canadian coach Bob Lenarduzzi was frank . " We didn ' t compete for most of the first half , and that was no good , especially after we were hammered 4 - 0 two weeks ago ( in Mexico ) " The Americans came out firing on all cylinders and all - time leading U . S . goalscorer Eric Wynalda might have had a hat - trick in the first 15 minutes . Twice he was open on the far post for right - wing crosses from Ernie Stewart but headed wide and then volleyed past the post . In between he put the Americans ahead from the penalty spot , coolly sending goalkeeper Craig Forrest the wrong way . Forrest had conceded the penalty when he upended Claudio Reyna as they both raced for a through ball in the seventh minute . The Americans were 2 - 0 ahead after 14 minutes when David Wagner headed on a Jeff Agoos corner and defender Eddie Pope rose at the far post to head into the roof of the net . Wagner , who plays for Schalke in the German Bundesliga , was making his debut as a starter for the U . S . team , replacing Brian McBride , who had lost his scoring touch in recent games as the national team went through a goal drought . His Schalke teammate Thomas Dooley was a dominant force in midfield while Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa were reunited at the heart of the American defence for the first time in a year . With midfielders Reyna and Stewart probing the Canadian defence with long passes and incisive runs , the Americans might have scored several more times , but the closest they came was when captain John Harkes hit the post from 30 yards ( metres ) . For the Canadians , who were seeking a measure of revenge against their giant neighbours for winning the ice hockey World Cup six months ago , it was a frustrating afternoon . The only player who threatened the Americans was forward Paul Peschisolido , who plays for West Bromwich Albion in the English First Division . Twice he came close at the end of the first half , first forcing goalkeeper Kasey Keller to race out and block one shot and then narrowly firing wide . Stewart , who plays in the Dutch First Division for Breda , tied it up for the United States , sliding home the third goal in the 89th minute after substitute Michael Mason set him free with a brilliant pass .

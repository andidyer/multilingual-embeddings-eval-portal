Analysts doubtful on Montenegro ' s new offshore status . Yugoslav economists said on Wednesday that Montenegro ' s efforts to become a centre for foreign offshore business could be used for tax evasion and money laundering while failing to lift its economy . They also questioned the legality of a batch of regulations recently implemented by the Yugoslav republic ' s government in the hope of wooing foreign capital . " Montenegrin legislation on offshore business directly contravenes the existing ( Yugoslav ) federal law and creates a huge institutional problem , " said Danica Popovic of the private Belgrade economic research institute CES - Mecon . Another analyst , who asked not to be named , said : " The offshore project could lead to classical money laundering " . But Montenegrin officials described the decision to offer substantial tax relief to offshore companies as a commitment to political and economic reform . Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Zizic said recently offshore companies would pay only 2 . 5 percent corporate tax and reinvested profit would not be taxed at all . On the weekend the authorities announced the opening of a first offshore firm , but declined to give any details . Analysts said the impact of Montenegro ' s drive to become an offshore centre on the economy may prove dubious and would not replace the need for sound market reforms in both Serbia and Montenegro . " The question is whether ( such a policy ) would lead to a widespread legal tax evasion and transfer of capital from Serbia to Montenegro , " Danijel Pantic of the Belgrade Economics institute said . He said foreign investment depended on political , economic and monetary stability , legal security , a developed financial system and an appropriate infrastructure . " Yugoslavia and Montenegro meet none of the above requirements . Therefore , it is difficult to believe this law on offshore companies will be crucial in attracting foreign investment , " Pantic added . - - Belgrade Newsroom + + 381 11 222 4254

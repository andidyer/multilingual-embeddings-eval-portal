Australian accused of 35 murders due to enter plea . Australian Martin Bryant is expected to appear in court on Monday to enter a plea on charges of murdering 35 people in Port Arthur , Tasmania , last April . Security will be tight around the Hobart Supreme Court , where the 29 - year - old Bryant is due to make his first appearance in court since being charged . Tasmania government spokesman Peter Hazelwood said Bryant would appear in court behind a shatter - proof glass screen . " A laminated glass screen has been erected and there will be metal detectors for people going into the court , " he said . Private security men and more police would also be deployed around the court and the main road outside the courthouse would be blocked during the hearing , expected to take about two hours . Bryant faces 70 charges , including 35 of murder , 19 counts of attempted murder , nine of grievous bodily harm and wounding , five of aggravated assault and two of arson . Indictments against Bryant are expected to be formally presented at Monday ' s hearing before Justice William Cox and Bryant will be asked to enter a plea . If Bryant pleads guilty , he is expected to be remanded until Thursday to hear submissions on sentencing . Sentencing would be on Friday . If he pleads not guilty , he is expected to be remanded until November 19 for a trial likely to last about three weeks . Bryant is under tight security in Hobart ' s Risdon Prison , and will be transported the 10 km ( six miles ) to the court under a police and prison guard escort . Of the 30 seats available for the public in the court , more than half will be set aside for residents of Port Arthur , one of the southern state ' s biggest tourist attractions . Proceedings will also be beamed via closed circuit television to another court room , where 70 local and foreign journalists are expected to cover the hearing . In May , Bryant appeared in court via a video link with his prison because of security fears . On April 28 , a sunny autumn Sunday afternoon , a lone gunman walked into the Broad Arrow Cafe at Port Arthur and shot 20 people as they ate their lunch . Within an hour a further 12 people , including a three - year - old girl , were gunned down either outside the cafe , in their cars , or hiding behind a tree . Three people were taken hostage and later found dead in the charred remains of a cottage . The killings resulted in a push by the Australian government to introduce tough new laws banning automatic and semi - automatic weapons .

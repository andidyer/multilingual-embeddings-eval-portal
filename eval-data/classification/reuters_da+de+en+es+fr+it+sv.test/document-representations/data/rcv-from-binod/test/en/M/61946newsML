Fed seen refraining from action but drain possible . The Federal Reserve is likely to refrain from open market operations on Wednesday but with Fed funds trading well below the Fed ' s 5 - 1 / 4 percent target for the rate , the Fed could decide to drain reserves , analysts said . After the Fed added reserves to the banking system on Tuesday via nine - day system repurchases , the Fed funds rate slipped lower from 5 - 1 / 8 percent , a level that was already below the Fed ' s target . The effective Fed funds rate on Tuesday was 5 . 02 percent , the Fed said on Wednesday , with funds trading as high as 5 - 3 / 4 percent and as low as 4 - 1 / 2 percent . On Wednesday , Fed funds were trading at 5 . 00 percent . " I don ' t think they ' ll do anything because they did that nine - day ( systems ) operation yesterday , but it ' s possible that we could see matched sales because the funds rate is so low , " said James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities . However , Glassman said the softness in the funds rate was probably linked to some temporary factors . " Bad weather in the East might have created some transportation float , increasing the amount of reserves in the system , and they might have missed on Treasury balances , " he said . Glassman said if the Fed does decide to drain reserves it will be because " they put too much in yesterday . " Josh Stiles , senior bond strategist at I . D . E . A . , said the Fed must choose between draining reserves or doing nothing . " I ' d say they ' ll probably do nothing and let the funds rate trade up on its own , " he said . " If they do something , it ' s just a fine - tuning operation and the add need remains starting tomorrow . " The second week of the two - week bank reserve maintenance period starts on Thursday , September 19 . At 1113 EDT / 1513 GMT , Fed funds were trading at 5 . 00 percent . - E . Freilich , N .

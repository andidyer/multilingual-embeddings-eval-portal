France to keep embassy open in Brazzaville . France said on Sunday it would keep open its embassy in Brazzaville even as it wound up its military operation in the Congo and repeated that it would not participate in a buffer force there . " We have not contemplated closing our embassy but naturally we will take the necessary measures to ensure its protection , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . He said he did not know how many troops would be needed to protect the mission in the embattled Congolese capital . The spokesman was answering questions after the last French evacuation flight for foreign civilians left Brazzaville . He repeated that Paris supported mediation efforts by Gabon President Omar Bongo and did not intend to leave its 1 , 250 soldiers on the spot as part of a buffer force , as suggested by Congo President Pascal Lissouba . The troops helped evacuate some 5 , 000 foreigners from the capital , which has been wracked by factional fighting . Lissouba repeated his call for a buffer force on French television , saying : " I am making a fervent call . I would have liked French forces , with ourselves and those in the positions opposite us to have formed a buffer force , to avoid exactly what is going on today . " Envoys of Lissouba and his predecessor and opponent , former Marxist military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso , took advantage of a lull in firing at the airport to leave for peace talks in Gabon . They travelled on the same plane . Paris planned to withdraw its troops within a week or two , military sources said .

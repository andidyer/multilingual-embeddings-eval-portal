GERMAN CALL MONEY FIRM , BUT NO REPO CHANGE SEEN YET . German call money remained firm on Monday amid continued , albeit waning , speculation that the Bundesbank was about to signal that five years of easier monetary policy is at an end . Dealers said the recent ease in the U . S . dollar from a 1997 peak of just over 1 . 89 marks had contributed to a dampening in speculation that the central bank would signal a move as early as this week . But the view persisted in the market that it was now only a matter of time before the central bank switched to a course of tighter monetary policy .

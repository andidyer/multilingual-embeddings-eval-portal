Piedmont buy underpinned Heidemij ' s U . S . result . Dutch consultancy Heidemij said on Tuesday its acquisition of Piedmont Olsen Hensley Inc early last year had helped offset the downturn in the U . S . environmental market . Heidemij ' s core U . S . environment business had seen turnover volumes fall by 15 percent , reflecting the market downturn due in part to the Republican majorities in Congress , chairman Frans Luttmer said . " But turnover is growing again due to new activities we were able to take on with Piedmont in developing so - called brownfield sites , " Luttmer told a results news conference . Brownfield sites are contaminated industrial terrains which are subsequently cleaned up and redeveloped . Heidemij derived 23 percent of group turnover in the U . S . last year . " It ' s a mixed picture in the United States , " Luttmer said , adding the environment market was " modest " but had bottomed out , while infrastructure demand was good . In the Netherlands , Heidemij ' s biggest single market accounting for some 47 percent of turnover , prospects were bright , Luttmer said . " Preparations are being made for a strong investment impulse in infrastructure investment . . . to boost accessibility and mobility , " he said . Elsewhere in Europe infrastructure budgets were pressured . " In Germany , France and Spain infrastructural budgets are temporarily under pressure because these countries wish to qualify for European Monetary Union , " Luttmer said . In Germany , demand had fallen reflecting lower building volumes and price pressure . Heidemij had cut German capacity by 10 percent in 1996 and sought to offset lower volumes by targeting specialist high - margin niche segments , he said . This situation was seen continuing into 1997 and possibly early 1998 , he added . " It ' s a question of riding out the storm , " he said . In Spain , by contrast , the market developed well . Heidemij derived 23 percent of group turnover in Europe last year , with a further seven percent being generated in Africa , Asia and Latin America . Luttmer said it was too early to give a forecast for 1997 . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter earnings hit by charge . Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co . , reporting results for the first time since the merger of the two brokerage companies , said Wednesday it earned $ 509 million in its second quarter , down from $ 551 million a year earlier . The results included $ 63 million in one - time costs related to the merger and other acquisitions , resulting in income of 83 cents a share . Excluding the one - time charges , Morgan earned $ 590 million , or 97 cents a share , up from 92 cents a share earlier . Sales increased to $ 3 . 5 billion from $ 3 . 1 billion . " That ' s pretty good earnings , considering the $ 63 million merger charge they took , " said Perrin Long , an independent analyst covering the brokerage industry in Darien , Conn . The company took the $ 63 million charge , worth 11 cents a share , to pay for the merger that brought together investment bank Morgan Stanley Group Inc . and retail brokerage and credit card company Dean Witter Discover Inc . on May 28 . Morgan bucked a recent trend in the brokerage industry as its profit increased from the first quarter of this year , when it earned $ 571 million . However , its trading revenue declined during the period . " Unfortunately , the earnings we ' ve seen so far for the quarter ended May 31 weren ' t quite as favourable as the quarter before , " Long said . " Part of the reason is that the May quarter includes the less - active markets in April and the Federal Reserve ( 0 . 25 percent interest rate ) raise . " Other brokerage firms reported slower second - quarter earnings . Goldman Sachs & Co . said on June that its 18 pre - tax earnings for the second quarter fell to $ 610 million compared with $ 905 million in the quarter ended Feb . 28 . A . G . Edwards Inc . said on June 17 that its quarterly earnings fell to 83 cents a share from 87 cents in the first quarter and Quick & Reilley Group Inc . on June 24 reported slower earnings of 49 cents a share . Morgan Stanley Dean Witter reported a slowdown in trading revenues to $ 722 million from $ 869 million the quarter before and commission income of $ 484 million , down from $ 490 million . Revenues from investment banking , however , rose to $ 581 million , up $ 59 million for the quarter , and income from investments rose to $ 136 million from $ 56 million . The company also reported $ 610 million in administrative and asset management fees , compared with $ 587 million the year before . Its merchant and card member fees dropped to $ 424 million from $ 436 million , and its servicing fees to $ 187 million from $ 202 million . The company increased the provision for consumer loan losses to $ 611 million , up $ 202 million over the second quarter last year and $ 8 million over the quarter ended Feb . 28 . The company said its net charge - off rate for managed consumer loans increased to 7 . 07 percent , up from 5 . 22 percent a year ago and 6 . 91 percent in the first quarter . The company added that the deliquency rate on its consumer loans was 6 . 9 percent for the quarter , up from 5 . 79 percent a year ago but down from 7 . 49 percent in the first quarter .

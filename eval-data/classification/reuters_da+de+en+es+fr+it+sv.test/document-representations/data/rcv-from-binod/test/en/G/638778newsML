Jospin cabinet due Wednesday night or Thursday . New French Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will appoint a broad - left cabinet including Communist ministers on Wednesday night or Thursday morning , sources close to him said . " Lionel Jospin ' s intention is to try to finish the formation of the government tonight or tomorrow morning at the latest , " the source told reporters . He said Communist leader Robert Hue had told Jospin on Wednesday the Communists would definitely take part in the cabinet . The Socialist party ' s national bureau voted to propose former prime minister Laurent Fabius as president of the new National Assembly , in which the combined left will have a 62 - seat majority over the centre - right . Party spokesman Francois Hollande will take over as acting Socialist party leader while Jospin , the first secretary , is prime minister and Jean - Marc Ayrault , mayor of the western city of Nantes , will be the Socialists ' parliamentary floor leader . Fabius , who was previously parliamentary speaker from 1988 to 1992 , defeated former environment minister Segolene Royal by 40 votes to five in a ballot for the post , known in French politics as " the perch " . The party appointments meant that Royal is likely to join Jospin ' s government and that Daniel Vaillant , the Socialists ' number two , is likely to enter the cabinet as interior minister , party sources said .

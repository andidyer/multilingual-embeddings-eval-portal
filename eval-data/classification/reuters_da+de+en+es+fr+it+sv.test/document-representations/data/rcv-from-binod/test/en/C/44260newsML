Air India to fly Bombay - Frankfurt - Chicago . Air India said it will start twice - weekly Mumbai ( Bombay ) to Chicago services with a Frankfurt stopover from October 31 . The Indian national carrier said in a statement supplied to Reuters it has fifth freedom rights to pick up passengers and freight in Germany for onbound transport and also to sell seats and cargo from the U . S . to Germany . The Thursday and Saturday flights , two of four weekly India - Germany services , will be upgraded from Tristar L15 aircraft to Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft , Air India added . The airline ' s cargo sales manager Germany , Ruediger Brasche , told Reuters in an interview available cargo capacity from Frankfurt to Chicago will probably be limited to one pallet space . This is because ex - India rates to the U . S . are much higher than ex - Frankfurt , he pointed out . Brasche said : " This service is something new for us . We will probably give the cargo space to a wholesaler but we will not go on to the market with low rates since Chicago is low enough already . " For the winter high season , Air India plans to increase from two to three Boeing 747 - 300 combi aircraft flights from Germany to Delhi and Bombay , in addition to the four passenger services , he added . A fourth combi flight is an option currently under consideration , he added . - Air Cargo Newsroom tel : + 44 171 542 7706 fax : + 44 171 542 5017

Caisses d ' Epargne not bidding for CIC . French savings bank grouping Caisses d ' Epargne said on Monday it had decided not to make an offer for CIC , the large regional banking group which is being privatised . It said its central board had met on Monday and noted that there were major difficulties with putting together a firm offer . Press reports have recently reported resistance to an offer from the state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations , which has 35 percent of the voting rights on the central board of the Caisses d ' Epargne . The Caisses d ' Epargne was seen as one of the main contenders in the privatisation of Credit Commercial et Industriel ( CIC ) , which is owned by state insurer GAN . A government tender for offers to buy 67 percent of CIC expired at 1600 GMT on Monday but the finance ministry said not to expect a ministry statement on Monday . Le Monde newspaper said on Monday BNP had decided to put in a formal bid but the bank would not comment . Societe Generale has also said it could be interested but has not made any declaration about a formal offer . - - Paris Newsroom + 33 1 4221 5452

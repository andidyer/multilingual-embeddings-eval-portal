Tunisia plans to open up insurance market by 1999 . The Tunisian government on Wednesday told the country ' s insurance industry it must prepare for an opening up of the market to foreign firms by 1999 . Finance Minister Nouri Zorgati also said that the finance ministry and professionals were meeting in a committee to draft a reform of the 1992 insurance code in a way that ends monopoly . " The insurance sector is the only ( economic ) sector enjoying a full protection . It is necessary that you prepare your firms during the next five years for an opening up to the outside world , " Zorgati told some 100 insurers meeting to discuss modernisation of the sector . He said among the reforms under discussion were an end to the monopoly of mutual insurance firm CTAMA , specialised in agriculture risks , and the freeing of insurance of exports . " The insurance code doesn ' t give it the monopoly , but separate legislations offer free tax to agriculture insurance with CTAMA . We should stop the monopoly and any insurance firm will be enabled to insure agriculture risks , " Zorgati said . " The law says that exports can only be insured by one institution . We should go toward insuring them by whatever institution , " Zorgati said . So far , exports are insured by Compagnie Tunisienne pour l ' Assurance du Commerce exterieur ( COTUNACE ) , with a capital of five million dinars - - 60 percent owned by the state , 32 . 5 percent by eight banks , and 7 . 5 percent by four insurance firms . Insurers at the meeting said that Zorgati was probably talking about freeing some of the services related to exports and not necessarily about the whole COFACE ' s activities . Tunisian Federation of Insurance Societies ( FTUSA ) Chairman Brahim Riahi said that Tunisian firms development was hampered by deficits in vehicle insurance where premiums are negotiated with the administration . Zorgati said that all insurance firms but one were now recovering from their deficits in the vehicle insurance , and hoped that from now , premiums would be set after accord with the consumers and not with the administration . Total premiums in the Tunisian insurance market , excluding COFACE and reinsurer Tunis - Re , were 281 . 67 million dinars in 1994 , up by 7 . 82 percent compared to 261 . 24 million dinars in 1993 , a FTUSA annual report showed . Vehicle insurance premiums , which accounted for 35 . 16 percent of the total premium income , were 99 . 03 million dinars from 83 . 77 million dinars in 1993 . The deficit fell to 18 . 96 million dinars in 1994 from 38 . 62 million dinars in 1993 . Overall deficit for the sector was 10 . 48 million dinars in 1994 , from 30 . 95 million dinars in 1993 .

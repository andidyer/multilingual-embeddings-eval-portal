Pro - Turkey Kurd group drives rebels from Iraq city . An Iraqi Kurdish militia , emboldened by an alliance with Turkish troops , drove fellow Kurds out of a key northern city in a bitter settling of scores at the weekend , an Iraqi opposition group said on Monday . A spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress told Reuters that the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) had overrun all six offices of Turkey ' s Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) in Arbil and executed prisoners . " The battles in Arbil resulted in 53 KDP ( fighters ) killed , " the spokesman said . " Among the PKK and allied parties , there was a total of 58 dead , 28 of whom were killed after capture , " the spokesman , based in London , said . The KDP has been aiding thousands of Turkish troops on a cross - border drive against the Turkish Kurd guerrillas in the mountains north of Arbil since last week . Northern Iraq has been out of President Saddam Hussein ' s control since the Kurds broke from Baghdad under Western military protection after the Gulf War in 1991 . Turkey ' s NATO allies have urged it to tread carefully in northern Iraq and to end the incursion soon . Ankara was criticised abroad for heavy - handedness with the local population in a similar cross - border drive two years ago . The Iraqi opposition accused the KDP of an atrocity against Turkish Kurds during the latest clashes in Arbil . " Five women were captured , raped and then publicly executed by the KDP in full view of the citizens , " said the Iraqi National Congress spokesman , citing satellite telephone communications inside Iraq . A pro - PKK group in Paris , meanwhile , said Turkish soldiers had joined with the KDP in a " massacre " of around 100 people . But there have been no reports of Turkish troops as far south as Arbil during the cross - border operation . The Turkish foreign ministry and KDP officials were not immediately available for comment . In Arbil ' s Enkawa district , a Turkish Kurd printing house lay gutted and pockmarked with bullets after the weekend clashes . Local sources said three PKK members had been killed in the house when the Iraqi Kurd group attacked . Three others were taken into custody and later executed , they said . Blood stains marked a pathway leading out of the back of the building and posters had been ripped from scorched walls on the building ' s first floor . One rocket fired at the building during the shootout had hit a neighbouring house . The KDP , led by Massoud Barzani , used 106 mm anti - tank guns on buildings occupied by the PKK or small affiliated bodies in three days of clashes in Arbil , the opposition spokesman said . The two Kurdish groups have a history of bad blood . The Iraqi Kurds joined Turkish troops in 1992 in an operation to flush the PKK out of northern Iraq , where they use bases to back up a separatist campaign in neighbouring southeast Turkey . The two factions clashed again in 1995 . The Iraqi opposition said the KDP was playing a leading role in the current Turkish drive . " We believe that Turkish ground troops have not participated in much of the fighting , " he said . " They have limited involvement through air and artillery . " More than 20 Turkish tanks and trucks were stationed near the town of Amadiye , witnesses said . Turkey said 1 , 142 PKK members had been killed in the six - day - long operation compared with relatively small losses on the Turkish side . Syria put aside rivalry with Baghdad to back Iraqi condemnation of the Turkish incursion . " It is an invasion and an occupation of Arab territory . It is a dangerous matter regardless of our view about any regime in the Arab world , " the official Kuwait News Agency quoted Syrian Vice - President Abdel - Halim Khaddam as saying during a short visit to the Gulf Arab state .

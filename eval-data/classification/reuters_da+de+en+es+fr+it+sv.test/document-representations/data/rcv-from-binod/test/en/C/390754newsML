Bau Holding to buy six Warsaw hotels . Warsaw municipality will sell its Syrena chain of six hotels to Austria ' s Bau Holding , Warsaw ' s deputy president Andrzej Wojtynski said on Thursday . " Out of bids by three shortlisted companies , Bau ' s offer proved to be the best . We agreed that we will sign a final agreement within four weeks , " Wojtynski told Reuters . Wojtynski declined to say how much Bau would pay for the 80 - percent stake in Syrena offered for sale .

Hotel employees will be offered 15 percent of shares in the chain and five percent will be put aside for a government programme to compensate former owners for property confiscated under communist rule . The Syrena hotels , called Metropol , Saski , Polonia , MdM , Saski , Polonia and Nowa Praga , were built under the pre - 1989 communist system and are mostly faded .

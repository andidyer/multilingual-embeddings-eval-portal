Philippine prosecutors want Marcos case dismissed . Philippine prosecutors on Tuesday recommended that a corruption suit against former first lady Imelda Marcos over a $ 80 , 700 diamond necklace be dismissed after the complainant said she had lost interest in suing her . The suit stemmed from a complaint by an official of a Manila development firm who said she gave Marcos the necklace in 1985 to prompt the Human Settlements Ministry to pay money it owed her company . Marcos was head of the ministry , which was responsible for livelihood projects for poor families , at the time . The complainant , Virginia Moreno , said a representative of hers handed the necklace to Marcos during a party . But Moreno told the court in a pre - trial hearing on Tuesday she was no longer interested in pursuing the case . State prosecutors , who filed the criminal suit against Marcos , recommended it be dismissed . The recommendation , however , is subject to the approval of the court as the government is considered the aggrieved party in criminal cases under Philippine law , court officials said . Marcos , now a congresswoman who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1995 , is facing an 18 - year jail term on a 1993 conviction of violating the anti - graft law in another case . She is out on bail while the verdict is being appealed . The widow of the late president Ferdinand Marcos faces more than 80 other criminal and civil suits for allegedly helping her husband steal up to $ 5 billion from the economy during their 20 - year rule . Imelda Marcos has denied the charges . The Marcoses were overthrown in a 1986 popular revolt .

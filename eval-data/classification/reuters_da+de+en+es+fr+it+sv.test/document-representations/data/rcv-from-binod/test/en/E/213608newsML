SLOVAK ECONOMY IN DANGER OF OVERHEATING - C . BANK . Slovakia faces the danger of an overheated economy as a result of rapid GDP growth fuelled by domestic demand , a senior National Bank of Slovakia ( NBS ) official said on Monday . " We can already see certain signs of an overheated economy resulting mainly from the speed and the quality of the growth of GDP , " Elena Kohutikova , head of the NBS monetary policy department , told a seminar on an OECD survey on Slovakia . Kohutikova said the the country ' s GDP growth was fuelled mainly by domestic demand , which , she said " is an unfavourable development from the long - term perspective . " " From a long - term perspective such a fast increase in domestic demand in an open economy such as Slovakia ' s , will not be favourable for development , " Kohutikova said . She would not disclose which steps , if any , the NBS will take to help prevent further overheating of the economy . Slovakia ' s GDP rose a real 7 . 1 percent in the first half of this year . Full year 1995 GDP grew by 7 . 4 percent . Domestic demand , which was at the heart of the growth , rose by 23 percent in the first half of this year . The government has forecast GDP growth of at least six percent next year . The NBS implemented a series of measures in July aiming to tighten the money supply and curb inflation and the expansion of credit . The moves included hikes in the last - resort lending facility , the Lombard rate and minimum reserve requirements for banks , which , together with a new NBS measure aimed at curbing domestic lending , gradually boosted interbank money market rates to around 15 percent . Slovakia ' s inflation , still one of the lowest in central and eastern Europe , rose 0 . 7 percent in October , putting the prices 5 . 3 percent higher year - on - year . However , Slovakia ' s key money supply measure , M2 , rose 19 . 0 percent year - on - year in September , compared with a 19 . 5 percent rise in August . The NBS has stated its 1996 full - year target of an M2 expansion of 11 . 6 percent year - on - year . - - Peter Laca , Bratislava Newsroom , 42 - 7 - 563 - 3687

Raytheon to buy Texas Instruments unit . Raytheon Co said Monday it had agreed to buy Texas Instruments Inc ' s defense business for $ 2 . 95 billion in cash . The deal marks another major step in the consolidation of the U . S . defense industry that began four years ago . It is Raytheon ' s third major acquisition in the past two years . The boards of directors of Raytheon and Texas Instruments have approved the deal , Raytheon said . The transaction , subject to government antitrust review , is expected to close in the 1997 second quarter , Raytheon said . " We have consistently said that we will remain a top - tier player in the defense industry , " Raytheon Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Picard said in a statement . " We are buying a growing , world - class business that competes successfully in several key defense electronics markets where Raytheon is not a significant participant . " Picard said the acquisition would increase Raytheon ' s annualized defense electronics sales to $ 8 billion and its current defense electronics backlog to $ 9 . 3 billion . Texas Instruments President and Chief Executive Thomas Engibous said in a statement the sale would allow his company to focus on " digital solutions for the networked society . " Texas Instruments ' s defense unit , which employs about 12 , 000 people , is based in Lewisville , Texas . It is expected to have 1996 revenues of about $ 1 . 8 billion . The unit supplies advanced defense systems , including precision - guided weapons , strike missiles , airborne radar , night vision systems and electronic warfare systems . Raytheon said the acquisition was expected to be non - dilutive to its earnings per share this year and should " provide increasingly positive contributions to earnings per share thereafter . " Raytheon has been a major player in the defense industry consolidation . In April 1995 it acquired E - Systems for more than $ 2 billion , and a year later it bought Chrysler Corp ' s defense - electronics business for some $ 475 million .

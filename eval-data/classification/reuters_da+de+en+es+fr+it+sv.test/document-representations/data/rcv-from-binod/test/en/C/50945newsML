RTRS - BHP hits two - year low in big sell - off . Shares in The Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd ( BHP ) hit a two - year low on Thursday as a sell - off of the resource giant continued into its third day . BHP shares breached their previous 1996 low of A $ 15 . 90 in late morning trading , despite finding earlier support above that level . At 11 . 30 a . m . ( 0130 GMT ) , the stock stood at A $ 15 . 86 , its lowest level since May 1994 and 26 cents off Wednesday ' s close . The sell - off , which began on Tuesday after earnings downgrades and BHP chief executive John Prescott ' s comments about the weak prices of copper and steel , has so far wiped off over A $ 1 billion off the company ' s market capitalisation . The copper , petroleum , steel , and minerals company is Australia ' s largest in terms of market capitalisation , and represents about 10 percent of the total sharemarket . Earlier in morning trading , brokers suggested the sell - off was overdone . " I think it ' s good value at these prices . It ' s probably a good buying opportunity , " a Melbourne broker said . " I did have a hold at around A $ 16 . 50 , but it ' s off 50 cents now , " he added . Brokers attributed the continuing descent of BHP ' s share price , which has wiped over A $ 1 billion off the company ' s market capitalisation since Monday ' s close , to follow - through selling on concern over the impact of weak copper prices on profit . BHP , which reported a 14 percent slump in group net profit after abnormals in the year to May 31 , is due to release its August quarter results on September 20 amid recent earnings downgrades for 1996 / 97 profit from some major brokerages . But a Sydney - based broker agreed current prices around A $ 15 . 90 offered a buying opportunity . " I think it ' s a sheepish mentality , " he said . " The copper price has been falling for six months and all the indications were there , but the broking community needed to wait until it hit its cyclical low . " BHP is the world ' s second largest producer of copper after acquiring Magma Copper Co in January for US $ 2 . 4 billion . - - Melbourne Bureau 613 - 9286 - 1421

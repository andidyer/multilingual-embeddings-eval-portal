U . N . Earth Summit agrees on forest plan . The United Nations Earth Summit agreed on Friday to put off until 2000 a decision on whether to negotiate a treaty on managing the world ' s shrinking forests . The plan was a compromise between the European Union and Canada which pushed for immediate talks towards a treaty , and the United States and a number of other countries which said efforts would be better spent enforcing existing laws . Environmentalists backed the United States , saying negotiating a treaty would only waste time and likely would result in weaker policies to curb timber companies . Under the deal , the U . N . Council on Sustainable Development would decide in 2000 whether to seek a treaty , after a panel on forest policies reports to it in 1999 . The panel established under the deal will also focus on pushing implementation of existing controls on logging . In addition , the panel will study effects of trade in forest products and services , and transferring technology and funds to poorer countries so they can better manage forest resources .

Belgian 10 - year OLO yield seen lower by end Q2 . Belgian linear bond ( OLO ) yields are likely to stage a recovery before the end of June despite pressure on rates in Europe caused by uncertainty over U . S . monetary policy , analysts told Reuters on Thursday . Three out of five analysts questioned said they expected the 10 - year benchmark OLO yield to fall to between 5 . 75 and 6 . 10 percent . One predicted little change from present levels , while one said the yield could inflate to 6 . 60 percent . The 10 - year yield was at 6 . 18 percent on Thursday afternoon , up from an all - time low of 5 . 50 percent hit on February 18 , but down from 6 . 68 percent one year ago . Whatever the outcome , the ride would be choppy , analysts said , with expectations of U . S . monetary policy remaining the driving force in the run - up to the next U . S . Federal Reserve policy meetings on May 20 and July 1 and 2 . " We are in a period when everyone is wondering where things are heading . We have had disappointment in the U . S . market which has triggered a negative reaction in Europe . But I think people are getting too negative about the outlook for monetary policy in the U . S . , " Generale Bank economist Sylviane Delcuve said . She saw the 10 - year OLO yield edging down to between 5 . 75 and 6 . 00 percent by end - June . " I expect some cooling down and people to look again at what ' s really going on . We have inflation of under two percent in Germany and growth of around 2 . 5 percent . This is just a statistical recovery , " she added . Kredietbank economist Caroline Ven was going for a yield nearer 5 . 75 percent . " The reasons are that we don ' t have any inflation pressures . . . and the improvement in the economy is not enough to close the negative output gap , " she said . Analysts expected Belgian unemployment to rise in the second quarter , meaning consumer confidence was not likely to pick up . However , room for optimism would decrease if the U . S . Fed did not tighten rates again to kill fears of inflation . " The risk to our scenario is that the Fed does not take action and inflation expectations in the U . S . make long - term yields rise and this affects European interest rates , " Ven said . BBL economist Bernadette Frederick expected the Fed ' s March 25 rate hike to be the last for a while . " We expect the American economy to slow down in the second quarter and so we see no need for a further rise in U . S . interest rates , " she said . In her scenario 10 - year interest rates in the U . S . should stay near their current level of 6 . 90 percent and German 10 - year rates should be near 6 . 00 at end - June . The Belgian benchmark yield would remain at around 10 basis points over Germany . For Dexia CC economist Jacques de Pover the focus on the U . S . was misguided . The 10 - year OLO could reach 6 . 60 percent by end - June as fears over stronger growth and economic and monetary union ( EMU ) pushed German yields up to 6 . 40 percent . " You must not forget that the arrival of the euro will be very negative for German bonds and the market has not yet discounted this . The European Central Bank will not be the Bundesbank , " de Pover said . All of the economists polled expected the Bundesbank to leave all its key interest rates unchanged in the second quarter , with the repo steady at 3 . 00 percent . In this scenario the National Bank of Belgium would not have to adjust its key central rate , also at 3 . 00 percent . No one was concerned by the fact the Belgian franc has apparently settled into a new range just below its ERM midpoint to the mark of 20 . 6255 , which it crossed early in February for the first time in two years . The franc was at 20 . 6365 / 80 to the mark on Thursday , down from around 20 . 60 at the start of 1997 and 20 . 54 one year ago . All of the analysts expected currencies to enter EMU at or near their ERM central rates to prevent speculative attacks between April 1998 , when participating countries are named , and December 31 , 1998 , when exchange rates are locked . " The central rates would not be a surprise to the market and all are credible , " BBL ' s Frederick said . - - Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6810 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

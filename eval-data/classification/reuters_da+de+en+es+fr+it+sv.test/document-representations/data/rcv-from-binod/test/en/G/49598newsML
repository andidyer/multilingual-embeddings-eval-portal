Cricket ' s dilemma - find friends , lovers , or die . Crickets flying through a summer night may face a tough choice - - seek companionship or turn into bat food . " Crickets have to make a yes - or - no decision in a hurry , and ones that waffle become bat bait , " said Cornell University researcher Robert Wyttenbach , whose experiment on cricket perception appears appears on Friday in the journal Science . The choice comes because crickets must differentiate between two key sounds of the cacophony of the night , according to Wyttenbach , who gave the insects a perception test originally designed for human babies . One is a low - frequency chirp made by other crickets . The other is ultrasound that helps bats track down , or " echolocate , " their evening snacks . Making a beeline for the other crickets might mean finding a mate , but not if it means failing to steer far enough away from the bats , according to Cornell neurobiologist Ronald Hoy . Hoy established part of this scenario years ago , showing that crickets can detect bats ' ultrasound . In this study , scientists figured out how the insect chooses between good sounds and bad . That process is called " categorical perception , " which " may be a basic and widespread feature of sensory systems , from humans to invertebrates , " the researchers wrote . Tethered crickets were put in a cricket flight chamber where , thanks to a fan and some wired - in sound , they thought they were flying . The scientists played sounds at 20kHz - - bat frequency - - over and over again until the crickets got blase . They then tried to get the bugs back to normal behaviour by playing a variety of sounds at other frequencies . They found that 16 kHz was the dividing line . Above that frequency , crickets responded to a " foe . " Below , they deemed a " friend . "

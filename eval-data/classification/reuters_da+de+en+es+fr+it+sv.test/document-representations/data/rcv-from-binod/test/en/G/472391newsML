Experts say mass suicide follows familiar pattern . It can begin with a smile from a stranger , or these days , an enticing message on the Internet . Cult experts say it is soon followed by manipulation , mind control , isolation , the breaking down of a human being ' s free will and ability to think rationally and maybe even by death . They say an apparent suicide by 39 people in a mansion outside San Diego was not the first and will not be the last such shocking act . The explanation lies in the ability of a charismatic leader to control reality for his followers , using tried and tested techniques to brainwash the human spirit . While authorities try to determine what caused members of the cult called the Higher Source to take their own lives , the experts said whatever the group believed its actions put it in the same class as followers of Jim Jones and David Koresh . They were willing to die for what their leaders believed , in one case by drinking poison at a cult compound in Guyana , in the other by setting their house in Waco , Texas , ablaze . " Jim Jones ' s last words to his followers was ' We will meet in another place ' and his followers drank the poisoned Kool - Aid because they thought they were going to heaven , " said cult expert Jim Siegelman , co - author of the book , " Snapping : America ' s Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change . " Siegelman calls the cult process a death spiral that takes place in three stages . First a person is enticed into the cult where his personality will be " snapped . " " These can be bright well - educated people who are in a major life transition . They have left home for the first time , they have just broken up with a lover , they are feeling lonely and suddenly they are greeted by a smiling , supportive stranger who offers them feelings of love and bonding and who radiates happiness and spiritual fulfilment , " he said . Former cult member Steve Hassan , who counsels others who have left cults , said he was enticed into membership by a smiling stranger and subjected to a flattering " Love Bomb " of appreciation . " Every human being is vulnerable , " he said in an interview with MSNBC . In the second stage , the convert is isolated , deprived of sleep and subjected to mind control techniques and indoctrination reinforced on a daily basis . The idea is to change subjects ' personalities overnight and make them totally susceptible and vulnerable to command , Siegelman said . The third stage in the death spiral is the confrontation - - real or imagined . In the case of the Jonestown mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 , 913 people died because a critical U . S . congressman had flown in to see Jones ' jungle compound . The Branch Davidian followers of David Koresh set themselves alight outside Waco , Texas , in 1993 as government agents moved in to break a siege of their compound . " The people who commit mass suicide under mind control do not think they are going to die . They think they are going to meet angels or aliens or be lifted up to heaven , " Siegelman said . First reports on the Higher Source mass suicide seem to bear that out . Their bodies were discovered in a mansion north of San Diego on Wednesday after police got a tip from a computer expert , Nick Matzorkis , who told them one of his employees , a former member of the group , had received a letter and videotape about the mass suicide . Matzorkis said the video showed the members saying goodbye and that they appeared happy about their decision . " They explained that by the time this letter was being read that they will have already , as they describe it , ' shed their containers , ' which is I guess what they use to describe their bodies , " Matzorkis told CNN . He said the cult members believed they were going to be taken away by a UFO hiding behind the Hale - Bopp comet as it neared Earth . Siegelman said first indications were that the cult used the Internet to entice members . " There are not just sexual predators on the net , but spiritual ones as well , " he said .

Japan Feb ethylene output down 10 . 9 pct mth / mth . Japan ' s ethylene output totalled 586 , 000 tonnes in February , down a scant 0 . 3 percent from a year earlier , but down 10 . 9 percent from January due mainly to fewer days in the month , the trade ministry said on Monday . Cuts in operating rates at some petrochemical firms were also likely to be responsible for the lower production in February compared with the January level , a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said . Mitsubishi Chemical Corp and Idemitsu Petrochemical Co Ltd said earlier this year that they had cut ethylene output by 10 to 12 percent amid high regional naphtha prices . In Japan , naphtha is the major feedstock for the production of ethylene , which is the building block for petrochemical products .

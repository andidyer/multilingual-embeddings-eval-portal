U . S . reminds elderly to get pneumonia vaccination . More elderly people are getting flu shots every year but many have not received a vaccination against pneumonia , federal health officials said Thursday . The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said a 1994 survey found that 55 percent of people aged 65 and over said they had received a flu shot but only 30 percent had obtained a pneumococcal vaccination . In 1993 , 50 percent said they had had a flu shot in the past year , while only 29 percent had ever had a vaccination for pneumonia . " It is our hope that at the same time that people receive their annual influenza vaccine they ' ll also be asked about their receipt of pneumococcal vaccine and receive it , " CDC epidemiologist Dr . Seymour Williams said . Influenza and pneumonia both hit hardest at the elderly . About 90 percent of the deaths from both illnesses occur among those 65 and older . But Williams said people paid more attention to the flu . " Pneumococcal infections are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia that require hospitalization and they cause approximately 40 , 000 deaths annually , " he said . " Influenza occurs on an annual basis . People are reminded more of influenza in the press and less so for pneumococcal . " Pneumonia , a serious infection or inflammation of the lungs , was the leading cause of death in the United States until 1936 . The CDC said influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were both paid for under Medicare . Flu shots are given every year but the pneumonia vaccine is generally given only once . The American Lung Association said the risk of pneumococcal pneumonia was greatest among the elderly , residents of nursing homes or other chronic care facilities , people with chronic illness and those recovering from severe illness .

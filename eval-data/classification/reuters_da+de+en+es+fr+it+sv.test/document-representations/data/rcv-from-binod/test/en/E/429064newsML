Russian economy may be big grower , but not soon . Russia may one day be Europe ' s fastest growing economy , but market reforms in the old Communist giant are not yet on the fast track , economists say . " They have already done an awful lot . Okay , they ' ve got further to go . But they ' ve made the commitment , and there ' s no turning back , " said Anthony Thomas , emerging markets economist at Kleinwort Benson in London . He said Russia was at least five years behind central European countries ' average annual growth rates of 5 percent to 6 percent . Earlier Friday President Boris Yeltsin appointed liberal ally Anatoly Chubais first deputy prime minister , a move likely to boost further free - market economic reforms in Russia . The appointment of Chubais , the mastermind of the Russian government ' s plan to privatise state - owned assets , had been widely expected and signalled the first of a series of promised dramatic changes in the Russian government . " The economy is on the threshold of growth , and the question is how fast and consistent will that growth be , " said Sergei Pavlenko of the Centre for Economic Trends in Moscow . " The time factor is the crucial element . The growth potential of Eastern Europe is exhausted . Russia is potentially Europe ' s fastest growing country . " Yeltsin pleased economists with his key state - of - the - union address Thursday . Despite warning that people ' s patience had worn thin with wage and pension arrears and the government was inefficient and lazy , Yeltsin was blunt and fresh in outlining specific problems Moscow must tackle . Critics say words are not deeds , and the political will to push reforms to the next stage may be difficult to muster . But analysts were encouraged that Yeltsin , who saw budgetary discipline and the elimination of corruption and tax reform as linchpins of a turnaround , was focusing on the same problems preoccupying Western economists watching Russia . " Yeltsin is tackling concrete economic problems . He ' s addressing key questions in the economy , " Pavlenko said . " His criticism was directed towards the fact there is no time to lose because otherwise , it could cost Russia dearly . " Economists said Yeltsin ' s forecast of at least 2 percent gross domestic product growth this year , the first growth since the Soviet collapse in 1991 , was not the most important element in his assessment of the economy . Russia watchers always say growth is just around the corner , but the economy contracted 6 percent in 1996 , despite a much flawed privatisation programme that has put most of the country in private hands over the last few years . But growth is tough to measure because an estimated 25 percent of output , work and services are in the grey , or shadow , economy and do not come up in the official figures . Vast salary and pension arrears are a danger point in social stability , while legions of major factories are on the brink of collapse , failing to pay enough taxes to match budget targets . Russia has passed the first stage of transition , stabilising the economy and bringing inflation down near Western levels . It is forecast at 12 percent this year . " Real recovery could be possible by the end of 1998 . And after six or seven years of decline , stabilisation would be a real achievement , " Thomas said . While restructuring may seem a welcome burden compared with eliminating hyperinflation and making market - style reforms take seed , it may be no less difficult . The buzz word these days in both government and private circles in Moscow is " restructuring , " the next , and potentially most painful , stage in making privatised but bankrupt enterprises spread out across 11 time zones work . " The Russian economy is in good shape , but it still has some torturous restructuring to go through . But this is more of a social question than an economic one , " Pavlenko said , adding that resistance to laying off workers was great . He said restructuring powerful natural monopolies like gas firm Gazprom and electricity generator and distributor UES was exceptionally important .

Bulls seen returning to Canada stock markets . Stock market bears have roamed through Canada ' s financial capital in the past few weeks , but the bulls may be rearing their heads again , some analysts said on Tuesday . " I have a feeling the worst is over for the Canadian market . Particularly since I think the commodity sector is going to be doing considerably better , " said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co . Inc . He said the U . S . market may remain pressured by interest rate concerns , but he forecast a divergence between markets in the United States and elsewhere . Dunnery Best , director of private client investing at Canadian brokerage Midland Walwyn , said he believed the recent decline was a consolidation that was near its end . " Has it run its course ? I would say largely , " Best said . Despite rosy predictions by some strategists , technical analysts were pessimistic about longer - term prospects for the market and questioned the enthusiasm of market watchers who watch fundamental factors . The Toronto Stock Exchange ' s key TSE 300 Composite Index , the bellwether for Canadian equities , has fallen about 10 percent from its all - time high of 6348 . 02 on March 11 . As of Monday , the market was down 4 . 2 percent for the year . Rising U . S . rates ignited a brushfire of market fears and prompted a raft of selling . Concerns in Canada also were fanned by Bre - X Minerals Ltd . , a Calgary , Alberta - based exploration firm whose shares plunged on March 26 when partner Freeport - McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc . said it found " insignificant " gold on its Indonesian gold property , touted as the largest gold find this century . The Bre - X saga hit key Toronto gold issues hard . Some analysts voiced hope that the 10 percent correction meant the market was poised to rebound . " We are still bullish on the market , " said Peter Dawkins , director of research at Midland . " Our view is that this is a healthy correction , " he added . Dawkins said the market should recover and break record levels later this year . The TSE 300 was up 40 . 37 points at 5 , 719 . 70 on Tuesday , boosted by unexpectedly weak U . S . consumer price data , which offset a surprising climb in core producer prices last week . But others observers maintained the recovery was temporary and that there was more blood - letting to come . Katherine Beatty , a technical analyst with MMS International , called Tuesday ' s rally a " a knee - jerk reaction " and forecast at least another 5 percent pullback . Technical analyst Joe Ismail at brokerage Maison Placements Canada said the market must rally by about 300 points in the next few days to prevent more losses . " On the strength of that rally , we will be able to tell whether we are going to be able to make new highs or if we ' re going to backtrack , " Ismail said . He said the major Toronto sub - groups - - banks , base metals and precious metals , must participate to make a rebound last .

Dalai Lama visit spotlights Taiwan - China dilemmas . When Tibet ' s exiled leader , the Dalai Lama , sets foot in Taiwan on Saturday , he steps into a complex minefield of explosive issues that divide Beijing and Taipei , himself and China and even Taiwan ' s people themselves . In a journey laden with significance for Taiwan , China and Tibet , the Tibetan Buddhist god - king planned a six - day tour of the Nationalist - ruled and deeply Buddhist island . By conventional reckoning , it will be the Dalai Lama ' s first footfall on Chinese soil since 1959 , when he fled into exile in India after a failed anti - Chinese uprising in Tibet . Even that is a point of contention , however , as Taiwan ' s strong pro - independence opposition factions reject the notion that the island is a part of China . The planned visit has angered the communist government in China , which proclaims as gospel that both Taiwan and Tibet have been inalienable parts of China for centuries . Beijing has lashed out at the Dalai Lama ' s journey and specifically at his expected meeting with Taiwan President Lee Teng - hui , branding both as " splittists " bent on independence from China for Taiwan and Tibet . " Both men are struggling for the same goal : splitting China , " Beijing ' s official China Daily said on Wednesday . " They do not really care about the interests of the people living in Tibet and Taiwan and the fate of the nation . " Analysts say the Dalai Lama ' s willingness to visit Taiwan reflected a change in his political stance . The saffron - robed monk had long declined invitations to come because the island ' s exiled Republic of China government , ousted from the mainland in 1949 , still takes the same stand as Beijing - - that Tibet and Taiwan are both part of China . The Tibetan leader advocates autonomy for the vast Himalayan region but has stopped short of demanding outright independence from China , which has kept Tibet under tight military , political and cultural control . " The Dalai Lama has his political aim , " said Chang Lin - chen of National Taiwan University . " He wants to use Taiwan to apply pressure on the Chinese communists and force them to hold talks with him . Apparently , he also wants to use the pro - independence sentiment in Taiwan to boost Tibetan independence . " The Dalai Lama , in an interview with Taiwan ' s United Daily News published on Thursday , said he agreed to visit to thank Lee for Lee ' s support of his 1993 five - point Tibetan peace plan . The Tibetan praised Lee as " the first president to have been elected democratically in China ' s 5 , 000 year history " , hailing him as " a leader with mercy and leniency " . Analysts said Lee appeared to be using the visit to raise Taiwan ' s international profile at China ' s expense - - hoping to establish a right to self - determination . " In recent years , Lee has intentionally provoked the Chinese communists , " said National Taiwan University political scientist Tim Ting . " He has two aims . First is to make the world see the Chinese communists as undemocratic and irrational . The second is to build up Taiwan nationalism . " Lee , like the Dalai Lama , has stopped short of advocating Taiwan ' s independence from China , but says reunification , still advocated by his ruling Nationalist Party , is impossible before China undergoes democratic reform . Chengchi University political analyst Milton Yeh said Lee was exploiting China ' s preoccupation with other matters , among them U . S . Vice President Al Gore ' s March 24 - 26 Beijing visit . " The timing is crucial , " said Yeh . " Taipei sees a window of opportunity while China is grappling with Hong Kong ' s return and the Communist Party succession . Aside from a strong vocal response , they expect Beijing will do nothing . " The Dalai Lama ' s itinerary takes him first to the cradle of Taiwan ' s independence movement , the southern port of Kaohsiung , prompting some observers to suspect he was aiding the independence - minded opposition Democratic Progressive Party . Democratic Progressives have demanded that Taiwan treat the Dalai Lama as a state guest , a strategy that would bolster their view that Taiwan , and perhaps Tibet as well , are states in their own right - - not subjects of Beijing . Taiwan ' s government has baulked , saying that since Tibet is part of the Republic of China , the Dalai Lama must be regarded as a local citizen - - a position likely to anger the Dalai Lama himself as much as Beijing .

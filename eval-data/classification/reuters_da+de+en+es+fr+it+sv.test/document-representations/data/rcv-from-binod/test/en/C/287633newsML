Mercedes expects to top North American sales goal . German luxury carmaker Mercedes - Benz AG will significantly exceed its 1996 North American sales target of 85 , 000 vehicles , the unit ' s president and chief executive said on Sunday . Michael Bassermann , head of Mercedes - Benz of North America , said sales had been led by the company ' s E - class sedan , the backbone of its car fleet . " Our sales have increased year over year . As you will hear in Detroit in more detail , our sales in the U . S . this year ( 1996 ) will exceed 85 , 000 , significantly , " he told reporters on their way to cover the Detroit Auto Show , which starts on Monday . Mercedes - Benz , a unit of Daimler - Benz AG , recorded North American sales of 76 , 752 vehicles in 1995 . The region accounts for about 15 percent of Mercedes ' worldwide sales . Bassermann gave no figures about sales or revenue , saying they would be released in Detroit . Mercedes will feature four models in Detroit - - the new CLK coupe , the SLK two - seat roadster , the E - class station wagon and the chassis for the M - class sport utility vehicle . The CLK will make its debut in Detroit . Mercedes said last week it would offer the SLK in the United States starting this month for $ 39 , 700 and hoped to sell 6 , 000 SLKs in the first year . The other three models will become available in autumn of 1997 . The M - class vehicle will be built at a new $ 300 million plant in Tuscaloosa , Ala . , and Bassermann said the factory was on schedule to produce the car . The plant , being built by a separate unit , Mercedes - Benz U . S . International , will have a capacity to produce between 60 , 000 to 65 , 000 units a year . The M - class will be first sold in the United States and then in Europe and Japan starting in 1998 . Bassermann told Reuters Mercedes had no plans to sell its new A - class compact in the United States . The car was first shown to reporters last month and will be introduced at the Geneva Auto Show in March . However , the A - class could serve as a platform for an electric car in the United States , Bassermann said . He said the automobile ' s small size - - it is about 10 . 5 feet ( 3 . 5 m ) long - - and fuel efficiency were designed for the crowded streets and higher gasoline prices of Europe and Japan . " Americans like space on the roads and in the cities , " he said . " . . . Fuel is so cheap here people don ' t think about their fuel bills . "

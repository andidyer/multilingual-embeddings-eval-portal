Israeli bulls still charging , analysts say . The rally underway on the Tel Aviv stock market has a long way to go because Israeli shares are still undervalued , analysts say . On Sunday , the Maof 25 blue chip index broke through an important psychological barrier of 300 points . " This is only a halfway stop on the way up instead of a peak . Whether the rally lasts another year or three I don ' t know , " Daniel Carasso , director of Israel research at UBS Ltd , said on Monday . Since hitting a recent low last July , shortly after the right wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swept into power , the benchmark Mishtanim index of top 100 shares has soared 73 . 5 percent , half of that in the past six months . " The big wave was from November to February , then we had some profit taking . Since May we have seen the market again rising strongly , " Ilan Doron of Solid Financial Markets said . Though a small correction of not more than five percent may be at hand , Doron predicts the Maof 25 will hit 360 by year end . The November - February rally made possible a series of successful bank privatisations and new share issues , most of them in the past month . Their success confirmed the market ' s underlying strength and helped revive the run - up which had sputtered in March and April . Secondary share offerings in state - controlled Israel Discount Bank and Bank Leumi boosted the primary market and helped fill the government ' s coffers , while in the private sector there were initial public offerings in Solel Boneh , Israel ' s leading construction contractor , and Comfy Interactive Movies , a maker of computer keyboards and software for young children . Attracted by the share offerings foreign investors are flocking to the Israeli market . They now account for about 12 percent of activity , up from nil three or four years ago but well below the 25 to 50 percent seen in other emerging markets . The macroeconomic picture has also helped the stock market . Analysts say the slowdown that began in the middle of last year is actually favourable for the market as long as the economy does not slide into a recession . The government has been forced to exercise fiscal restraint , allowing interest rates to slowly come down amid stable inflation . A slowing economy also enables companies to control wages . " We have been saying since December 1996 : ' Fasten your seatbelts ' " , said Eran Goren , managing director of Zannex Securities . Shares have been cheap for the last three and a half years , said Goren . The market is trading at a 1997 price - to - earnings ratio of 12 . 2 , up from nine at the beginning of the year but still well below international levels . " The market has a lot of mileage to go , " Goren said . How far will depend on whether the general public returns to the market . Burned by a market crash in 1994 small investors shunned stocks . But there are indications the public is testing the waters as tens of millions of shekels in new money flows into mutual funds . Volume hit a three - year high last week and now averages over 200 million shekels a day , up fourfold from days prior to the takeoff but still well below pre - crash levels . " I think the public will return to the market gradually , they won ' t rush in , " Goren said . - Tel Aviv newsroom , 972 - 3 - 537 - 2211 x238

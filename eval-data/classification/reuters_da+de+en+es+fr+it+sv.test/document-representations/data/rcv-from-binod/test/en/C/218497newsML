Oil markets steady as Iraq prepares oil exports . World oil prices held steady on Tuesday as the market took the possibility of resumed Iraqi exports in its stride , although traders said the news was causing underlying pressure . World benchmark Brent crude for January delivery on the International Petroleum Exchange traded three cents lower at $ 22 . 59 a barrel at 1241 GMT . January Brent futures fell sharply on Monday after Iraq said it had agreed all conditions of the U . N . limited oil sales deal allowing it to sell $ 2 . 0 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicines . " It is not a big thing any more . It will not make a whole lot of different to global supply and demand , " an oil industry source said , adding that Iraq ' s return to the market had been factored in for some time . He added that the market had underestimated demand and that was why prices recently rose to a five - year high in October after the Iraq - U . N . oil - for - food deal was postponed in September . " Demand has been underestimated for the last year or so , and the only reason prices are where they are is because of that , " the industry source said . Cold weather and low inventories of both crude and heating fuels in consumer countries have made for a tight oil market , allowing OPEC producers to reap the benefit of higher oil prices and turn a blind eye to quota - busters among the 11 - member cartel . Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) oil ministers meet in Vienna on Wednesday to set their production ceiling for the first six months of 1997 amid expectations of a rollover . OPEC raised its ceiling by 800 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in June to 25 . 03 million bpd to absorb the Iraqi crude which was expected to appear in September . The delay and the subsequent rise in prices has eroded the volume Iraq is likely to export under the price formula agreed with the United Nations for its sales contracts . The formula prices Iraq ' s Kirkuk grade at a $ 1 . 3 - $ 1 . 5 discount to physical Brent , which on Tuesday was valued at just under $ 22 . 70 a barrel . An oil industry source said Iraqi crude exported via pipeline to Turkey ' s Ceyhan terminal would compete with Russian Urals and with Iranian light crudes in the Mediterranean and European markets .

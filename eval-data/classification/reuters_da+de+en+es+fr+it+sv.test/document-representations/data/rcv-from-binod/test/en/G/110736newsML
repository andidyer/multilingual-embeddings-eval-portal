Indonesia reacts negatively to Nobel peace prize . Indonesia reacted negatively on Friday to the award of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize to two men born in the troubled territory of East Timor , saying that one of them was a " political opportunist " and avoiding comment on the other . " It is the right of the committee with its own criteria to award the Nobel Peace Prize . However we regret that a political opportunist has received the prize , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl told Reuters , referring to East Timor independence movement leader Jose Ramos - Horta . The Nobel Committee said Ramos - Horta and East Timor Bishop Carlos Belo were jointly awarded the prize for their work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor . The territory was annexed by Indonesia 20 years ago . " We do not know the basis on which they have given the prize , " Fadyl said , declining to comment on Belo ' s award . " It is quite a surprise and quite regrettable that such a reputable institution has decided to give this prize to a person like Ramos - Horta , who has quite clearly been involved in the manipulation of the people of East Timor for his own interests , " he said . " He has incited the people of East Timor to separate from the unitary Republic of Indonesia . "

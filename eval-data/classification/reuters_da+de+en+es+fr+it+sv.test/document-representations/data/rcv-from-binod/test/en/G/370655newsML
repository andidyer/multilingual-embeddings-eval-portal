U . S . envoy has high hopes for Clinton - Yeltsin meet . A summit next month here between U . S . President Bill Clinton and Russia ' s Boris Yeltsin could prove an historic step to post - Cold War security for Europe , the U . S . envoy to Finland said on Tuesday . " That ' s for me my hope , " Ambassador Derek Shearer told journalists at a briefing . " This could be a very very important summit . " Officials on both sides are working hard to hammer out a solution to Russian opposition to expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) , the toughest topic on the agenda of the March 20 - 21 meeting , he said . " Ideally by the time we get to the summit there will be some progress made and some agreements , " he added . If the presidents can reach agreement on NATO expansion , it would mark a milestone in the evolution of Europe ' s security , bringing former East - West foes much closer together and paving the way for constructive development for Russia . Shearer could say little about the likely content of Clinton and Yeltsin ' s talks . Washington on Friday said the summit would take place in Helsinki instead of the United States to ease the strain on Yeltsin , who is in ill health : Shearer said Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari took the initiative to bring it here . In Finland ' s past role , as a militarily neutral but west - facing country bordering with the Soviet Union , Helsinki has witnessed many Cold War meetings between East and West .

BENPRES UNIT SEEKS FOREX ADJUSTMENT SCHEME . Bayan Telecommunications Holdings Inc ( BayanTel ) said on Monday it had asked the government to allow a facility under which it could adjust tariffs in line with fluctuations in the Philippine peso . BayanTel executive vice - president Primitivo Penaranda told Reuters the company had filed a motion with the National Telecommunications Commission to consider its petition because the recent de facto devaluation of the peso had affected revenue . He said Bayantel ' s rival Philippine Long Distance Telephone ( PLDT ) was allowed such a facility . " PLDT has been approved one and it ' s illogical that other carriers do not have one . We have long submitted our petition and we are pushing for it especially now with the weaker peso , " he said . Penaranda said that BayanTel has suffered from the weaker peso since bulk of its financing or close to $ 300 million had been sourced from dollar - denominated loans . The Philippine peso is now about eight percent weaker compared to its level before July 11 when the currency was effectively devalued . BayanTel , a unit of Benpres Holdings Corp , operates an international gateway facility and a local exchange service . - - Katherine Espina ( 63 ) 2 - 841 - 8936 ; Fax ( 63 ) 2 - 817 - 6267 - - Email : manila . newsroom @ reuters . com

Shuttle Atlantis to return home on Wednesday - NASA . Astronaut John Blaha ' s 54 - million - mile ( 87 million km ) orbital odyssey was set to end on Wednesday with the return to earth of the space shuttle Atlantis , NASA officials said . The weather forecast was looking favourable for a touchdown at Florida ' s Kennedy Space Centre , mission control told the six - member shuttle crew on Tuesday . " We ' re pretty optimistic you guys are going to be checking out your ground legs tomorrow , " spacecraft communicator Bill McArthur radioed . Atlantis was scheduled to land at around 7 : 47 a . m . EST ( 1247 GMT ) under partly cloudy skies . A second landing opportunity was available 90 minutes later if necessary . John Blaha , who spent four months aboard Russia ' s space station Mir , was to ride back to earth in a cushioned reclining chair , his body wired with sensors so doctors can monitor his health as gravity returns . Blaha , 54 , was uncertain how he would cope once gravity resumed its grip on his body . " I may have tremendous difficulty , I may have no difficulty at all , he said before leaving Mir on Sunday . " It will be a surprise to me . " Blaha will have spent 128 days in orbit , the second longest stay in space by an American . Shannon Lucid set the U . S . space endurance record last year with a 188 - day mission to Mir . Shuttle commander Mike Baker and pilot Brent Jett flexed the spaceship ' s control surfaces and fired up its manoeuvring rockets on Tuesday in a routine test before landing . While the landing systems were checked , other crew members packed up gear in an experiment and storage module mounted in the shuttle ' s cargo bay . Atlantis spent five days docked at space station Mir to collect Blaha and drop off his replacement , Jerry Linenger . The shuttle also delivered more than three tonnes of supplies and equipment to the 11 - year - old space station . Atlantis was scheduled to return to Mir in late May to relieve Linenger from duty .

Brazil ' s highway potholes to be filled - Cardoso . Brazil ' s crumbling highways will be free of potholes by the end of the year , President Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged on Tuesday . " Within 120 days there will be no more potholes and the highways will have new central lines painted , " Cardoso said in a radio address . " Many highways are effectively impassable . " Brazil ' s federal government is responsible for the upkeep of about 36 , 600 miles ( 51 , 000 km ) of roads . In several regions , they have been reduced to dirt tracks by years of neglect , tropical rain and heat and the pounding of trucks . Every year , an estimated 50 , 000 people die in road accidents in Brazil , many of them victims of the poor state of highways . Cardoso said once the potholes had been filled , the government would seek to asphalt dirt roads . He said Brazil would also press on with its highway privatisation programme and transfer federal roads to states .

Romania opposition bid to oust Iliescu hits climax . The Romanian opposition ' s drive to oust ex - communist President Ion Iliescu reaches a climax at an election rally on Wednesday after exposing deep unhealed wounds in the Balkan country . Two questions dogging Romanian society since the 1989 fall of communism have burst into the open in the final stages of Iliescu ' s increasingly grim attempt to beat off challenger Emil Constantinescu in Sunday ' s run - off presidential poll . Was the upheaval against executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu a revolution or a coup to put Iliescu and other aides in power ? And who was responsible for later riots by miners in Bucharest targeting opposition parties and market reforms ? " It was a true revolution based on discontent aimed at dismantling an ailing system , " Iliescu said of 1989 in the candidates ' second television debate on Tuesday night . " I don ' t know where Mr Constantinescu was then . I was in the middle . I could have been among those now in their graves . " Constantinescu retorted that the truth had yet to be told about why 1 , 500 people had been killed , mostly after Ceausescu was executed by firing squad west of Bucharest , and at whose hands . " We will find the truth we have been unable to find for seven years , " he said . " Justice must run its course . Truth is like the air we breathe . Our future cannot be built on lies . " Constantinescu , a geology professor , was four points behind Iliescu in the first round of the presidential contest but has since won support from the third - place finisher , former prime minister Petre Roman . Both were to address Wednesday ' s rally . The first opinion poll published before the run - off gave a 53 to 47 percent lead to Constantinescu . But it said a quarter of those asked were undecided . Surveys in Romania also tend to be erratic . An array of parties has lined up behind Constantinescu , including former nationalist groups once allied with the president and most first round also - rans . Iliescu has adopted a more aggressive tone in the second round , telling voters that Constantinescu is intent on bringing back exiled King Michael and restoring big landowners liable to take away their homes and livelihoods . Constantinescu ' s Democratic Convention promises to implement faster reforms , tax cuts and improved social benefits to close the growing gap in living standards with ex - communist states Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic . But the opposition says Iliescu must be beaten to complete the break with communism which started with the rout of the president ' s Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) in parliamentary elections earlier this month . Iliescu created a safety net for himself by winning election to parliament , as did Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and 16 ministers certain to be thrown out of their jobs . In Tuesday ' s debate , Constantinescu pressed home accusations that the president had tried to isolate rivals and slow reforms by encouraging miners who smashed buildings and beat up hundreds of people in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991 . " This was the most despicable aspect of the Iliescu regime . All human rights were trampled underfoot , " he said . Iliescu denied the allegations . " I never called in the miners . On the contrary , I intervened to calm things down . " " The truth is you were provoking civil war , " replied Constantinescu . " If I become president , this will never happen . I will never talk to mobs who attack state institutions . " Scuffles broke out near the television studio after the debate . Romanian media said an Iliescu aide had suffered minor injuries .

U . S . says focus now on Bosnia institution - building . The United States will work with Bosnia ' s election winners to establish new government institutions for the next month and then turn its attention to whether NATO - led troops should stay on , the State Department said on Monday . After first - ever national polls on Saturday that some doubted would ever take place , " our focus will be to work with the people who win in the elections , to arrange the meeting so that the new institutions can be formed and fully established , " spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters . These institutions include the Bosnian presidency , the court , the bank and the legislature and " will be the focus of U . S . efforts over the next month or so , " he said . To that end , the top vote - getter in the three - member Bosnia rotating presidency - - expected to be current President Alija Izetbegovic , a Moslem - - is to meet in Paris soon with Serb President Slobodan Milosevic . Burns said it was not certain if French and American negotiators would be at the table . The official winners of the controversial election are to be announced in the next few days and after that get together to start building the new government institutions . " We need to see how that process unfolds before we can make a decision on whether or not there will be a need for a security force to stay on beyond the mandate of the IFOR security force , " Burns said referring to the 60 , 000 - man NATO - led Implementation Force that has been helping to implement the peace deal in Bosnia . " I ' m sure we ' ll have conversations with our allies about that . But we said last week - - and we meant what we said - - that we ' d have to see what the environment was post - elections . . . . particularly the process of forming the new institutions . That ' s going to be critical , " he said . President Bill Clinton has said 15 , 300 U . S . troops who are the core of IFOR ' s Bosnia effort would be leaving in mid - December . But many U . S . and other officials have acknowledged some kind of follow - on force would be needed . Former assistant secretary of state Richard Holbrooke , who led a U . S . delegation to observe Bosnia elections this weekend , said he was confident IFOR would complete its mission by December , but some follow - on presence would be required . " Everybody understands that you can ' t just go from 60 , 000 forces to zero without an implosion . It would be irresponsible , " Holbrooke told PBS - TV ' s " NewsHour with Jim Lehrer . " " I am utterly confident that the president ' s original pledge for the completion of the IFOR mission in a year will be maintained , " Holbrooke said . Burns spelled out the upbeat U . S . view of the elections , saying it was extraordinary they were held at all after nearly four years of war among Moslems , Croats and Serbs . Asked about a formal complaint by Izetbegovic ' s party that the polls had many irregularities and should be voided , Burns said the criticism was not surprising given that the rival factions were at war only one year ago . Also , he said , the complaint was " probably written and thought about " before the elections ever took place . He said the complaint " was overcome in most respects by a public statement made by President Izetbegovic yesterday . " In that appearance , Izetbegovic " thanks the United States and the international community , says that . . . the Bosnian government remains committed to full implementation of the Dayton agreement , and certainly indicating . . . that any irregularities that they are concerned about will be dealt with according to " the Bosnia peace accords , Burns said .

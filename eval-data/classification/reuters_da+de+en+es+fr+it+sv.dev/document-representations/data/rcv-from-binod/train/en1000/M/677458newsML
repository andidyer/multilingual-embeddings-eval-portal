Dlr extends gains in late Tokyo as trade fears ebb . 0616 GMT TRADED HIGH / LOW AS OF 0600 GMT USD / JPY 114 . 60 / 70 114 . 69 - 114 . 15 USD / DEM 1 . 7245 / 50 1 . 7257 - 1 . 7200 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The dollar extended its gains against the yen from overnight levels by late Tokyo trade on Friday , lifted by short - covering as concerns eased that U . S . - Japan trade friction would boost the yen , dealers said . They added , however , that persistent selling pressure from Japanese exporters and others remained in place , keeping the dollar from reaching 115 yen . " Political pressure on the yen eased after remarks by President Clinton and this has pushed the dollar / yen up , but commercial selling pressure remained , " said a senior dealer at a Japanese bank . In a White House interview recorded for Japanese television before departing on Thursday for the Denver summit , Clinton said he was concerned about Japan ' s large surplus with the United States but added that exchange rates should not be used as way to correct trade imbalances . The U . S . and Japan unveiled on Thursday a formal consultive process in which they would discuss deregulation of key sectors of Japan ' s economy . " The prime minister through this agreement has invited the United States to participate in helping Japan formulate deregulation initiatives , " said U . S . Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky . The news prompted a slew of short - covering overnight and also prompted unwinding of hedge sell positions by Japanese trust banks here , dealers said . Dealers ' focus on the Group of Seven ( G7 ) nations ' summit later in the day lessened after Clinton ' s remarks , with some saying that anything surprising was unlikely to come out of the summit . " I don ' t think the issue of Japan ' s trade surplus will be discussed intensively at the summit , " a city bank dealer said . Some dealers said focus had shifted to the results of the " tankan " , the Bank of Japan ' s quarterly survey of corporate sentiment , on June 25 . But others remained cautious ahead of the summit and demand for dollar put options stayed strong . The dollar / yen risk reversal for one month , which shows the pricing differential between puts and calls , favoured dollar puts at around 2 . 0 / 2 . 5 percent on Friday , unchanged from Thursday . It was the highest level since in April 1995 , when the dollar sank to its post - war record low of below 79 . 75 yen . " People are expecting less emphasis will be placed on the ( U . S . - Japan ) trade surplus . If the G7 doesn ' t say anything conclusive , I think dollar / yen will be still bid , " said a dealer in Singapore . Dealers in Singapore said activity was driven by the mark / yen cross , but trading was confined to a narrow range . The mark failed to remain firm after stop - loss mark buying orders at around 66 . 50 yen briefly pushed it up , Tokyo dealers said . It was at around 66 . 40 / 43 yen at 0651 GMT . The dollar closed at 114 . 06 / 11 yen in New York on Thursday . - - Singapore newsroom 65 - 8703080 , T . Ito , Tokyo , 81 - 3 - 3432 - 1397

Christopher heads to Addis Ababa on Africa tour . U . S . Secretary of State Warren Christopher flies to Ethiopia ' s capital on Wednesday to press for a 10 , 000 - strong African force for use in humanitarian crises and for a new African candidate for U . N . secretary - general . On the first visit by a secretary of state to sub - Saharan Africa for more than six years , Christopher arrives in the hilly Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa from Mali where he began his five - nation African tour on Monday . Officials said he would hold talks on Thursday with Organisation of African Unity Secretary - General Salim Ahmed Salim , who stood as a candidate in the 1970s for the top U . N . post but was vetoed by the United States . Christopher , 70 , would also meet ambassadors to the 54 - member OAU , which has its headquarters in Addis Ababa , before flying to the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha on Friday . OAU officials said Christopher would give a lecture on " The OAU and Peace in Africa " at OAU headquarters expected to dwell on a U . S . drive to train , equip and help deploy an African force of 10 , 000 . The OAU had been planning an emergency response force made up of national army detachments trained and equipped to respond immediately to humanitarian crises on the world ' s poorest continent . Assistant Secretary of State for Africa George Moose toured Africa last month to solicit troop commitments from Zimbabwe , Botswana , Ethiopia , Uganda , Tanzania , Kenya and Mozambique . Christopher said on Tuesday Mali had agreed to join the U . S . plan for the African force . Officials said Christopher in Addis Ababa would urge African ambassadors to drop their endorsement of Egypt ' s Boutros Boutros - Ghali for another term as U . N . secretary - general and to name their own candidates . African diplomats said it was unlikely they would disown Boutros - Ghali just because the United States wanted them to . " Boutros - Ghali has received endorsement from the vast majority of OAU member states , " said a diplomat in Addis Ababa . " It may look simple for the United States but for Africa it is a matter of principle and prestige . They would rather see a non - African take the post than disown their own candidate . " But the OAU has held the door open for another candidate for the U . N . chief should Washington make good a veto threat . Some countries like Niger have already made known their candidates . After talks with Christopher , Mali signalled on Tuesday that it could accept a U . S . veto of Boutros - Ghali ' s reappointment provided the job went to another African . Mali had previously endorsed the 73 - year - old Egyptian secretary - general , dismissed by Washington as unfit to lead the world body into the 21st century . Christopher was expected to praise Prime Minister Meles Zenawi for Ethiopia ' s economic revival since the country was wrecked by 17 years of Marxist rule which ended in 1991 . On Friday , Christopher meets Tanzanian , Kenyan , and Ugandan leaders in Arusha and the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda before flying to South Africa and Angola .

India panel recommends cut in Container Corp stake . [ CORRECTED 13 : 10 GMT ] India ' s Disinvestment Commission said on Friday it had recommended that the government ' s stake in the Container Corp of India ( Concor ) be cut to around 51 percent from the current 77 percent through a public issue of shares . " A public issue that would enable the company to raise 2 . 5 to 3 . 0 billion rupees would need to be considered . Taking this into account the Commission recommends that disinvestment of government holdings may be restricted to 10 million shares and the company may also go in for public issue of 12 . 5 million shares . " This would bring down the government holding to around 51 percent , " the commission said in its third report . The report said Concor ' s paid - up capital of 65 million rupees needed to be increased in view of a World Bank loan of 3 . 8 billion rupees ( $ 106 million ) , which would become repayable after 2002 and limit the firm ' s ability to raise further debt . The commission recommended that Concor adopt a book - building process to sell shares to institutional investors , and follow it up with a retail offering to small investors at a discount of 10 percent to the institutional price . Being a core company of strategic importance , disinvestment in the company should not exceed 49 percent , said the report , presented to the Finance Ministry on Thursday . " Its well - organised distribution network , planned investment in rolling stock and technological improvements in operation would enable it to hold its own and maintain its market share , " the report said . Container Corporation reported a net profit of 531 million rupees ( $ 14 . 8 million ) in 1995 / 96 ( April - March ) , up from 229 million rupees in 1994 / 95 ( corrects years from 1996 / 97 and 1995 / 96 respectively ) .

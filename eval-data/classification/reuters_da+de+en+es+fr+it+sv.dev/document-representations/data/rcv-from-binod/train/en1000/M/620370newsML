U . S . West Coast crudes ease amid end - month lull . Crude oil prices on the U . S . West Coast were marked lower on Wednesday , though traders said business was in the doldrums as the focus changed from June to July barrels . " There is not much going on , which is typical of this time of month , " said a trader at a major oil company in California . After pipeline scheduling was completed last week the market ' s attention shifted to July barrels but buyers are expecting weaker prices and holding off , traders said . Regional benchmark Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) crude has been declining steadily relative to U . S . benchmark West Texas Intermediate / Cushing ( WTI ) for nearly three months after peaking in early March at an 80 cent discount to WTI . Last Friday BP America sold a cargo to Texaco Transport and Trading at a discount of $ 1 . 75 , 25 cents lower than the previous reported discount . One of the factors weighing on crude prices in the region has been the steady influx of crude from abroad , particularly Latin America and this is expected to continue . " Peruvian , Colombian , Ecuadorean , Argentinan . . . they ' re all still on offer , " said a trader for a refinery on the West Coast . To relieve pressure , BP has been selling ANS down the pipeline to Texas and Mid - Continent markets at a rate of about 30 , 000 barrels per day as well , on top of its program of sales to Asia after the export ban was lifted last year , traders said , though BP declined to comment directly on sales to either of these regions . Meanwile , heavier valley crudes were seeing flat or easier differentials to posted prices , which were lowered on Tuesday by between 25 and 50 cents , traders said . The American Petroleum Institute ' s weekly report showed crude stocks not much changed last week , with a 122 , 000 - barrel rise to 62 million barrels , about two million barrels below last year ' s level . - - New York Energy Desk , + 1 212 859 1620

Stripper ' s lure cited in spouse - murder case . A man who police say pawned his wife ' s engagement ring two days after her death and carried on a costly and secret infatuation with an exotic dancer faces a bail hearing Thursday on murder charges . Craig Rabinowitz , 33 , was arrested last week in the death of his wife , Stefanie , 29 , an attorney with a respected Philadelphia law firm . Documents released by authorities say Rabinowitz , a latex glove salesman , was obsessed with a dancer at a Philadelphia strip club and showered her with tens of thousands of dollars worth of gifts . Stefanie Rabinowitz was found dead in the bathtub of the couple ' s home in this wealthy Philadelphia suburb by paramedics responding to an emergency call from her husband . The death was initially treated as an accident , but an autopsy revealed Stephanie had been strangled by hand for at least four minutes , Montgomery County Coroner Halbert Fillinger said . An examination turned up no trace of sleeping pills or signs of drowning . Rabinowitz denied killing his wife , and his attorney said a stranger reported in the neighbourhood may have been the killer . Friends and relatives refused to believe Rabinowitz could have killed his wife , who he met 13 years ago at a summer camp . They had a 1 - year - old daughter . Shortly after Rabinowitz surrendered to police May 5 , prosecution documents revealed he had frequented an expensive strip club called " Delilah ' s Den , " and spent thousands of dollars on a single dancer . While the business he ran from his home languished , Rabinowitz allegedly spent several afternoons weekly with the dancer , known as " Summer , " and spent nearly $ 30 , 000 on her between January and April of this year . Prosecutors have said a possible motive for the slaying may have been a $ 1 . 5 million life insurance policy Rabinowitz took out on his wife a month before her death . Press reports said Rabinowitz owed $ 100 , 000 in credit card debt , and had recently borrowed $ 300 , 000 against his house . On the night Stephanie died , a prosecution document said , the dancer called Rabinowitz on his private cellular phone and left a message on his voice mail . The dancer was questioned in the case but not charged . The prosecution also alleged Rabinowitz had a receipt in his pocket indicating he had pawned Stephanie ' s engagement ring two days after her death , and had told friends he had " $ 20 , 000 upstairs and a suitcase in the trunk . " Prosecutors are expected to seek bail of $ 5 million , contending there is a risk Rabinowitz would flee .

Senate probers seek Dole campaign documents . The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee announced Wednesday it had issued 10 new subpoenas in its investigation of campaign fund abuses , one of them for documents from the failed campaign of Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole . The committee said the subpoenas also sought documents from the Republican National Committee , the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton - Gore presidential campaign . They also included demands for documents from some tax - exempt groups that Democrats claimed worked on behalf of Republicans . A spokesman said the committee had issued 73 subpoenas in all in its investigation of improper fund raising in the 1996 presidential race between President Clinton and Dole . The committee chairman , Sen . Fred Thompson , a Tennessee Republican , and its ranking Democrat , Sen . John Glenn of Ohio , also announced they had reached an agreement with the White House for the voluntary production of documents without subpoenas and for interviews with White House employees . They also said they have a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department to assign up to 10 FBI agents to the committee next week . The agents will work with the Republican majority and the Democratic minority on the committee , Thompson and Glenn said . The committee had been concentrating on Democratic fund - raising tactics . Issuance of the new subpoenas expands the investigation to Republican activities , including the Dole campaign . In addition to the Senate committee , a Justice Department task force of 31 FBI agents and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight are investigating campaign funding activities , including soliticitation of improper or illegal money from foreigners . The investigators also are examining solicitation of big donors with incentives such as coffees with Clinton and overnight stays in the Lincoln bedroom in the White House . The Justice Department is reportedly also investigating whether China secretly directed money for the 1996 campaign , an allegation denied by Chinese officials . It is illegal for candidates or their organisations to solicit or accept donations from foreign governments and foreign nationals are barred from donating to American campaigns unless they legally reside in the United States . The Democratic National Committee said it was returning $ 3 million in questionable or illegal contributions it received , many from Asian Americans or foreigners , and raised mostly by three Chinese American fund - raisers - - John Huang , Charles Yah Lin Trie and Johnny Chung .

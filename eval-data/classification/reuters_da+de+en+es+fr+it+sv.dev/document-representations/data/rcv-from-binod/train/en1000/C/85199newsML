Alaska Air to build new Anchorage cargo center . Alaska Airlines broke ground Monday on an $ 8 million facility to manage the airline ' s growing cargo traffic at the Anchorage International Airport . The company plans to renovate an old MarkAir Inc . building it purchased in June . The facility , to total 65 , 000 square feet , is scheduled to open in the fall of 1997 , Alaska Airlines said . Alask Air Group Chief Executive John Kelly , who attended the groundbreaking with Alaska Gov . Tony Knowles and Anchorage Mayor Rick Mystrom , said the new facility will consolidate the carrier ' s cargo functions that are now scattered around various locations at the Anchorage airport . " This will put everything under one roof , " increasing effiency for the carrier and its customers , Kelly said at a meeting of the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce held after the groundbreaking . Alaska Airlines badly needs expansion of its current cargo capacity in Anchorage , Kelly said . Cargo handling in Anchorage is expected to increase in the next five to 10 years from the current level of slightly over 90 million pounds a year to 120 million pounds a year , he said . The Alaska air - cargo business is especially busy during the summer , Kelly said . " During the summer , we had cargo sitting outside becaue we just ran out of space in the existing facilities , " he said . Alaska Airlines ' existing Anchorage cargo sites total only about 20 , 000 square feet , he said . The carrier has long considered plans to increase its ability to handle cargo in Anchorage , Kelly said .

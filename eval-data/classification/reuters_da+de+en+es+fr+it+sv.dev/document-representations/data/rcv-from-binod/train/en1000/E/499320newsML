Czech inflation should now lag other goals - minister . The Czech authorities have made marked progress in fighting inflation , and it should now rank behind other economic goals , Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday . Addressing a news conference , Dlouhy said priorities should include easing pressure on the state budget . " The main target is to break the trends in payment balance and pressures which have been appearing in the state budget . But we should not sacrifice economic growth , which will likely be slower than we expected in 1997 , " Dlouhy , an economist , told reporters . " Inflation is only the last target . I am not saying we should not care about it at all , but it has dropped significantly , more than we were expecting , " he added . When asked if the central bank should cut interest rates , Dlouhy replied : " Through this hierarchical organisation of targets I am indirectly answering your question . " He did not elaborate . Consumer prices rose 0 . 1 percent in March , leaving year - on - year inflation at a record low of 6 . 8 percent . Concerns over the economy have been growing since industrial output figures showed a real decline in January and February , which analysts say is a result of restrictive central bank policies imposed in mid 1996 . The government and the Czech National Bank ( CNB ) have been considering a series of measures to help the economy , stabilise the foreign trade deficit , cut wage growth and bring state finances to balance . On Thursday , the CNB said it would lower minimum reserve requirements for banks to 9 . 5 percent from a previous 11 . 5 percent , though it did not touch interest rates . The government said it would announce the measures after a regular meeting on April 16 and many analysts have said a rate cut may be in the cards if key M2 money supply figures expected this week are favourable . Dlouhy declined to say what measures were under consideration , but warned against any irreversible action . CNB governor Josef Tosovsky again ruled out devaluation of the crown in a late Wednesday night interview with Czech Television . The 1997 state budget , approved as balanced with revenues at 549 . 1 billion crowns , showed an 8 . 5 billion deficit at the end of March . The trade deficit rose to 27 . 2 billion in February from 16 . 3 billion in January . - - Jan Lopatka , Prague Newsroom , 420 - 2 - 2423 - 0003

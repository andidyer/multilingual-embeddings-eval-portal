Malaysian youth group says may sue Lee Kuan Yew . The youth wing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ' s political party said on Friday it may sue Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew for libel despite his apology for remarks about a Malaysian state . In a rare public apology , Lee said on Thursday he was sorry for saying the Malaysian state of Johor was " notorious for shootings , muggings and car - jackings " . The remark , made in a court affidavit in a libel suit by Lee against Singapore opposition leader Tang Liang Hong , sparked a day of protests on Thursday in which Malaysian youths waved placards calling Lee " stupid " , " senile " and a " bloody idiot " . " Pemuda ( youth ) accepts the apology , but at the same time is still considering to take legal action , " Hanafiah Man , media relations officer of the youth wing of the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) , told Reuters . " We are getting legal advice from our panel of lawyers whether we have grounds ( to sue ) . So it is still subject to study , " Hanafiah said . " Pemuda is serious in this thing because we do not want it to be repeated . We want a full stop there . " The Star newspaper on Friday quoted UMNO youth wing chairman Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as saying the group would go ahead with a libel suit to ensure no other Singaporean leader repeats the same offense against Malaysia . " To quote ( Indonesia ' s late president ) Sukarno , if all wrongdoing can be forgiven easily , there would be no need for heaven or hell , " the Star quoted him as saying . The comments by Lee , 73 , about Johor were made in a sworn affidavit on January 27 in proceedings against Tang , who fled to Johor Baru immediately after the Singapore general elections on January 2 in which he lost a bid for parliament . Lee ' s affidavit about Johor had been offered as part of an argument disputing claims by Tang that he feared for his life in Singapore . When the affidavit came to light , after Tang ' s lawyers released it to the media , Malaysia on Wednesday officially demanded an apology and a retraction of the remarks . A statement of apology issued by Lee ' s office said he had not been to Johor since 1990 and the affidavit reflected " his perception based on reports he had read in the press . It was unfortunate that subsequently it became public " . Asked if Lee ' s statement satisfied Malaysia ' s demand for a retraction , Hanifiah said : " We will study all these implications . "

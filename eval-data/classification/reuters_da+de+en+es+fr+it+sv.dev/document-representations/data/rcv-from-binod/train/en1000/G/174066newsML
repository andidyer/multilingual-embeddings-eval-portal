Simpson jury sees videotaped glove demonstration . Jurors in O . J . Simpson ' s civil trial on Wednesday watched a videotape of the former football star struggling to pull on a pair of bloody gloves during a pivotal moment in his criminal trial . In the video from June 15 , 1995 , Simpson was seen having trouble fitting into the brown leather gloves , one discovered on his property and the other found near the bodies of his slain ex - wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ron Goldman . Prosecutors in the criminal case argued that the gloves were dropped by the killer . The defence claimed the glove found at Simpson ' s home was planted by the police . The seemingly bad fit of the gloves during the demonstration was later cited by Simpson ' s criminal defence attorney , Johnnie Cochran , who told jurors during his closing arguments in that case , " If it does not fit , you must acquit . " Jurors in the civil trial followed the action in the tape closely , some taking notes . Simpson ' s criminal trial ended last October with his acquittal on double murder charges . He is currently battling a wrongful death civil lawsuit brought by the families of the victims . Tuesday ' s replay of the now - famous glove demonstration came during the testimony of Richard Rubin , the same witness who was on the stand when prosecutors asked Simpson to try on the gloves . The plaintiffs ' attorneys called Rubin , a former vice - president for the Aris glove company , to testify the two gloves were a pair manufactured in limited quantity before 1992 and sold only in Bloomingdales department store in New York . Brown family attorney John Kelly then showed Rubin a series of pictures taken prior to the murders depicting Simpson wearing leather gloves as he provided television commentary during football games . Rubin testified the gloves seen in the photos were the same brand and style as those found at the murder scene and at Simpson ' s home . The families ' attorneys claim Nicole Brown Simpson purchased two pair of the gloves , called Aris Leather Lights , on Dec . 18 , 1990 . Rubin then examined the bloody gloves and testified they were about 10 percent smaller than their original size , due to " conditions of normal wear and tear , time and shrinkage . " Prosecutors argued during the criminal trial that blood and moisture on the gloves had caused them to shrink after the killings . In response to a question by Kelly , Rubin said he watched Simpson ' s demonstration during the criminal trial and concluded " they ( the gloves ) fit , with a poor quality of fit . " Simpson lawyer Robert Baker introduced the videotaped demonstration , which was displayed to the civil trial jurors on a large television screen , then asked Rubin to concede that the gloves were too small in the palm area . But the witness replied , " They actually did fit across the palm . " The plaintiffs ' attorneys asked Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki for a sidebar conference immediately before Rubin took the stand to argue the defence should not be allowed to show the tape , but Fujisaki apparently disagreed .

Daimler seeks fuel - cell car launch in 8 yrs . Germany ' s Daimler - Benz AG and Ballard Power Systems Inc of Canada said Monday they hope to see commercial roll - out of passenger cars powered by their fuel - cell engines in about eight years . But the companies emphasized that they have a long way to go to reach their objective with the most important hurdle being to reduce the costs . " The cost is the most important thing . We have to reduce the cost of the fuel - cell system by a factor of one hundred , I believe , " Ferdinand Panik , head of the project for Daimler , told a news conference in Vancouver . Key to achieving the necessary cost reduction will be mass production , he said . Daimler , maker of Mercedes vehicles , is targetting initial production of the fuel - cell engines at 100 , 000 units . Earlier Daimler and Ballard announced a collaboration designed to develop Ballard ' s fuel cell technology into a clean - burning automobile engine . Daimler will take a 25 percent stake in Ballard and the deal represents total investment by the two companies of C $ 450 million . The companies said they may be able to introduce a fuel - cell engine system for buses earlier than eight years . Ballard ' s cells convert fuels like hydrogen into electricity without combustion and thus produce far less emissions than traditional engines . Ballard President Firoz Rasul said a joint venture between the two companies will seek to market the systems to auto makers around the world .

ICI shares rebound from recent weakness . Shares in Imperial Chemical Industries Plc rose on Monday amid bargain - hunting after their recent slide and as a small German acquisition allayed worries over a rumoured huge European takeover , dealers said . The stock was up 11 - 1 / 2p at 754 - 1 / 2 by 1213 GMT in modest volume of 657 , 855 shares . ICI shares touched a low of 715p earlier this month , their lowest since March 1995 . Earlier ICI said it was buying BASF AG ' s syngas catalyst business , which had sales of about 15 million stg . " One or two people had been saying they were about to do a big deal and this has just taken the pressure off a bit , " said one market - maker in the stock . A report in the Daily Mail earlier this month said ICI was poised to finance an acquisition in continental Europe with a one billion stg rights issue . ICI subsequently announced the purchase of a small Swiss paints business . " What we are seeing today is just a bit of bottom - fishing going on , " said another dealer . Added another : " The stock has been a bit bombed out and this is just a bounce . " Others pointed out that export and international stocks like ICI had been squeezed by the recent strength of sterling and could have come back into favour as the currency weakened . The pound was recently trading at 2 . 6548 marks , down from last week ' s high of 2 . 7240 . - - David Holmes , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5106

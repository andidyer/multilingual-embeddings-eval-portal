Cambodia ' s Khmer Rouge deny executing Briton . Khmer Rouge radio on Sunday denied a report that guerrillas of the radical left - wing organisation had executed British mine disposal expert Christopher Howes . The clandestine radio , which is controlled by hardliners in the secretive movement , said the Khmer Rouge " was never involved in this story " and rejected reports that the guerrillas had killed any foreigner . Howes , of the Mines Advisory Group ( MAG ) , and his interpreter Houn Hourth were abducted in the northwest province of Siem Reap last March . They were believed to have been taken to Anlong Veng base commanded by Khmer Rouge hardliner Ta Mok near Thailand . The Bangkok Post on Friday quoted a Khmer Rouge officer as saying Howes had been executed on Thursday in Anlong Veng . The officer , loyal to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and Ta Mok , gave no clear reason for the alleged murder saying only that it was linked to a rebellion on Wednesday by dissidents in a Pol Pot camp . Military and government officials said on Saturday they had no evidence to confirm the report , while a MAG official said they were currently treating it as an unconfirmed report . Troops loyal to Ieng Sary , foreign minister in Pol Pot ' s brutal 1975 - 79 Khmer Rouge " killing fields " rule , have broken with the Pol Pot ' s hardliners and opened peace negotiations with the government . Khmer Rouge radio , which remains under the control of Pol Pot and Ta Mok loyalists , signalled the rift on August 8 when it accused Ieng Sary of embezzlement and ordered his execution . The Khmer Rouge was included in Cambodia ' s U . N . - brokered peace pact of 1991 but reneged on the deal and has fought the government that emerged from general elections in 1993 . The rebels have since abducted at least seven Westerners and are known to have killed six of them .

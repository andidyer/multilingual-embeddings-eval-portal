ROWING - REDGRAVE POISED TO CHANGE MIND AND GO FOR FIFTH GOLD . Drained in body and mind after winning a fourth consecutive Olympic gold , Steve Redgrave summoned just enough energy to deliver one of the more colourful quotes of the Atlanta Games . " If anyone sees me near a boat they can shoot me , " he said after partnering Mathew Pinsent to victory in the coxless pairs . " This is it for me . " Less than two months later the indications are that Redgrave will be busy dodging bullets in the run - up to the 2000 Sydney Games . " I ' m very , very tempted to go to Sydney , " Redgrave said this week . " I have got to be happy with myself in 10 years . I don ' t want to look back and say I should have carried on . In the next two months I will have to make a decision . " Son of a builder and educated at a local school , Redgrave is an unlikely representative of a sport associated in Britain with striped blazers , straw hats and large drinks containing lots of ice . Nothing has come easily since he was at school and his training routine in the four years up to Atlanta involved three training sessions a day , seven days a week and 48 weeks a year . In Atlanta , Redgrave listened with wry amusement as Carl Lewis , another in the elite group who have won gold medals at four Olympics , explained how he had maintained his form over the years . " He had long breaks , " Redgrave said . " I wish I could have had long breaks . " Lewis , winner of nine Olympic titles , is deeply conscious of his place in history , referring repeatedly to other track and field luminaries , notably Jesse Owens and Al Oerter . Redgrave seems more concerned with fulfilling his potential . " It ' s not a question of going for five , " he said . " It ' s looking back in 10 to 20 years and saying I was mad to stop . " People say I should stop at the top . But what is the top ? At the end of the day I need to be satisfied in my own mind . " At some stage I ' m going to get back into the boat . I don ' t know at what level that will be . I have to be satisfied in my own mind that I want to go on . " Redgrave and Pinsent were the only Britons to win gold at Atlanta in the nation ' s worst overall Olympic performance since the 1952 Helsinki Games . The national inquest even reached parliament with Labour leader Tony Blair attempting to score political points by blaming the ruling Conservative government for the decline in national sporting prowess . Prime Minister John Major has announced plans to fund a 100 million pounds ( $ 155 million ) national sports academy , a proposal greeted with some scepticism by Redgrave . " To say that a sports academy is going to save British sport is very , very naive and very wrong , " he said . " Where are the athletes going to come from ? " Soon Redgrave will sit down with coach Juergen Grobler and decide whether to continue for another four years . And if he does decide to carry on to Sydney , will Redgrave be satisfied with a silver medal ? The competitive spirit gleams suddenly and fiercely in Britain ' s most successful Olympian . " No . If you ' ve got the incentive to do it there ' s no reason why you can ' t stay at the top . "

Arafat criticises U . S . Jerusalem resolution veto . Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Saturday criticised the United States for vetoing a U . N . Security Council resolution demanding that Israel halt work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . " We were surprised , just as all Arabs and Moslems were surprised , by the United States ' use of the veto especially since it had guaranteed in the Madrid agreement . . . that there would be no demographic changes in Palestinian lands in the interim period especially in the city of Jerusalem , " he told Oman ' s official news agency ONA before leaving Muscat . Arafat added that the U . S . move was " considered a violation of American guarantees " and a violation of " agreements which were signed ( in ceremonies ) at the White House hosted by President Bill Clinton " . The United States on Friday cast its second veto in two weeks to kill a Security Council resolution demanding that Israel halt work on a controversial new Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem . Fierce clashes flared along an Israeli - Palestinian confrontation line in the West Bank town of Hebron on Saturday , putting more strain on the Middle East peace process a day after an Arab suicide bombing in Tel Aviv . Palestinian security forces in Gaza rearrested a recently freed leader of the Islamic group Hamas that claimed responsibility for the Tel Aviv cafe attack that killed three Israeli women , a Hamas source said . Arafat , who was speaking in Muscat on his way to Islamabad for a summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , said there was still no proof of who was behind the attack . The Palestinian leader condemned Israel ' s new housing project , saying it was part of a plan to surround East Jerusalem with Jewish settlements . Arafat said the question of what steps the Palestinians should take would be high on the agenda at the OIC summit .

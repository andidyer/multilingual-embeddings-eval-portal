Eastman Chemical sees sustained growth . Eastman Chemical Co said on Tuesday it expected its specialty plastics business to grow at a 12 to 15 percent rate annually , mostly due to the growing number of uses . Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Earnest Deavenport also said Eastman Chemical was in the best position to weather the downturn in polyethylene terephthalate , because of its favorable cost position and broad new product range . Eastman said it was on track to double its polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) capacity to 3 . 5 billion pounds by the year 2000 , to meet product demand , which is expected to grow by between 12 and 15 percent annually . The company was also investigating methods of low - cost expansion of existing polyethylene capacity , it said . It was already building more specialty plastics capacity in Kuantan , Malaysia , to support growth in this business . Eastman said it also expected steady , long - term earnings growth in its fibers business , based on anticipated market volume growth of 2 . 7 percent annually over the next five years . Cash flow and debt capacity would be sufficient to finance future growth , Eastman Chemical said . In its chemicals business , the company also said it was seeing continued demand for oxo chemicals . Growth in that area was also driven by new product introductions , such isophthalic acid , and Eastman ' s development of new technology for epoxy butene chemistry , the company said . - - New York newsdesk 212 - 859 - 1610

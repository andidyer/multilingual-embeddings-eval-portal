El Al privatisation proposal takes wing . Israel ' s Transport Ministry proposed on Thursday to float the government ' s entire shareholding in El Al airlines in the domestic market but said the carrier must stay grounded on the Jewish sabbath . Investor concern over the sabbath flight ban and heavy security costs has kept an El Al privatisation from taking off even as the government has sold off shares in many other state - owned companies . " The plan for the sale of all the shares of El Al to the public will be presented next week to officials in the Prime Minister ' s office , " a Transport Ministry spokesman said . " We ' re aiming to implement the sale during 1997 . " The government ' s last effort at floating El Al , in a global offering in 1995 , was cut short when underwriters assigned the carrier what the Treasury considered very low valuations of $ 90 to $ 150 million . The spokesman said Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy , an orthodox Jew , would make El Al ' s privatisation conditional on continuing a ban on Sabbath flights . But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month the Sabbath flight issue had not yet been decided . Under ritual Jewish law , travel is banned on Saturdays . A committee headed by Netanyahu ' s economics adviser , Moshe Leon , was due to have completed an investigation of the sabbath and security issues by mid - January . El Al is not among the companies included in the government ' s privatisation plan for 1997 . The airline , which has been profitable for most of the last decade , is expected to post a huge loss for 1996 . An El Al spokesman said today the carrier would show losses of about $ 85 million for 1996 . " We ' re hoping to cut cut losses to about half that , " he added . The company has 3 , 500 full - time and 1 , 000 seasonal employees and 26 aircraft . The transport ministry spokesman said the ministry was proposing to float the shares without underwriters and that an undetermined percentage would be offered to the airline ' s employees . Under the terms of the proposal , no single shareholder could hold more than five percent of El Al in the first year after the offering , the spokesman said . The government currently controls 100 percent of the carrier and is widely expected to maintain a golden share to ensure it could use El Al to maintain Israel ' s overseas airlinks during times of emergency .

Canadian Foreign Minister meets Cuba ' s Castro . Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy met Cuban President Fidel Castro on Tuesday and said Canada was making some progress in its policy of dialogue with Cuban officials . " I don ' t want to tell you that we are about to have a great breakthrough but it ' s a work in progress , " Axworthy told reporters late on Tuesday after meeting Castro for nearly three hours over dinner at the Palace of the Revolution . " We ' ve made some progress today and I hope by tomorrow ( Wednesday ) we will have some further developments , " Axworthy said . He said he raised issues such as human rights and political prisoners with Castro , but did not give details . Axworthy , accompanied by Secretary of State for Africa and Latin America , Christine Stewart , arrived on Tuesday afternoon for a 24 - hour trip , the highest level visit to the communist - ruled island by a Canadian official in two decades . The visit has highlighted Ottawa ' s difference with Washington over Cuba policy and ruffled some feathers in the United States . Canada believes it can best encourage political and economic reform on the island through constructive engagement . The United States has long sought to isolate Cuba and last year toughened its 35 - year - old economic embargo on Cuba with its Helms - Burton law , which includes provisions to punish some third country firms doing business with Cuba . Ottawa has been a leading opponent of the law . The Canadian minister , who described his session with Castro as " cordial , very open and sometimes very amusing , " stressed that the current talks were part of ongoing dialogue with Cuban officials . He said the process " does demonstrate that you can talk to the Cubans and they ' re prepared to talk to you , as long as you come in a pretty straight forward way and not hectoring . " " We have established confidence , some trust , some respect , and now I think that ' s translating into some serious dialogue about how we can work together , " added Axworthy , who earlier Tuesday held talks with his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina . Axworthy did not mention it , but he was working during his visit on a joint declaration for future cooperation on a range of areas that were expected to include several steps in the area of human rights and governance . In Washington , U . S . State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters on Tuesday that Canada was rewarding Castro by sending its foreign minister to visit with him . " It doesn ' t make sense to reward a dictator in our own hemisphere who ' s completely behind the times , " Burns said . But Axworthy sought to tone down any disagreement on Tuesday night , saying Burns had later called the Canadian Embassy in Washington " to explain his words and to say that while the United States does not itself follow these methods they certainly don ' t oppose our doing so . " Axworthy , who will also hold talks on economic ties , was due to visit the tourist resort of Varadero on Wednesday , returning to Havana for a Canadian Embassy luncheon that may offer a chance for more talks with Castro . He was scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon before returning to Ottowa . With U . S . firms absent because of the embargo , Canadian firms have become one of Cuba ' s key business partners as the island restructures its economic ties after the collapse of the old Soviet Union . Canadian firms are leading investors in Cuba in sectors such as mining , oil exploration and tourism , and Canadians are among the largest group of foreign tourists to the island . Bilateral trade was $ 425 million in 1995 and $ 400 million in the first 10 months of 1996 , according to Canadian officials . Axworthy ' s visit is the first by a Canadian foreign minister since Castro ' s 1959 revolution . The last high - level visit by a Canadian to Cuba was that of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau in 1976 .

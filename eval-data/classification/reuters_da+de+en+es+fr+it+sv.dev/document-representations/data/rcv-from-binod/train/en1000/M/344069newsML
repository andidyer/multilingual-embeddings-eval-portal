US CREDIT OUTLOOK - GDP eyed for sales , inventories . Friday will see the first in a series of key economic reports on the U . S . economy in the form of fourth - quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth . Analysts consider GDP one of the key indicators Federal Reserve policy makers will look at before deciding whether to tighten monetary policy at their meeting Tuesday and Wednesday . Most economists expected a strong report , but estimates were all over the board with the consensus at a 3 . 9 percent rise . Most analysts said that pace would not continue into 1997 . Friday also will see the Chicago purchasing managers report for January , new home sales and the University of Michigan consumer confidence index . The Chicago survey often foreshadows the broader NAPM survey , which was due Monday . " The market has already built into prices a strong fourth quarter GDP . What the market and the Fed obviously are more concerned with is whether that momentum carries over into 1997 , " said John Williams , chief global markets economist at Bankers Trust Co . Final sales should be the most watched component , Williams said , perhaps more than the overall number . " The inventory component also will be important as high inventories suggest weakened growth going forward and low inventories suggest increased production going into 1997 , " Williams said . He expected a 3 . 5 percent rise in fourth quarter GDP . Williams said that while correlations between the Chicago purchasing survey and NAPM historically have been " lousy , " traders nonetheless may react to the number as it provides one of the first readings on manufacturing activity for the year . " People are grasping at any bits of information they can get , " Williams said . He also saw new home sales being weaker . " GDP ' s definitely the big item and we ' re looking for it to rise 4 . 5 percent in the fourth quarter . Such a rise could easily have Treasuries retesting the bear market lows seen earlier this week . . . . about one point lower , " said John Canavan , analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc . " Whether or not it holds those lows remains to be seen . " Canavan also said he expected to see a weaker Chicago purchasing report and new home sales , but the data would not be tame enough to offset a bearish GDP reading . He too stressed that final sales and inventories would be the most scrutinized components of the GDP report . Stuart Hoffman , senior economist at PNC Financial Corp . , said GDP growth of 3 . 5 percent to 4 . 0 percent was probably already priced into the market and only data suggesting a pickup in inflation and more than 4 . 0 percent GDP growth was likely to force a marked retracement . " The market ' s going to dig at GDP a little , digest it and wait until the Chicago and home sales numbers at 1000 EST / 1500 GMT . There may be a little bit of secondary reaction if those numbers surprise , " Hoffman said . James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc . , looked for rises of 4 . 0 percent in GDP and 5 . 0 in final sales . Glassman said even if inventories slowed further , the bond market could take comfort knowing a Fed tightening was not waiting in the wings as inflation remained low . The soft durable goods data seen this week have alleviated the fears of many about growth in the first half , he said . Late Thursday , the two - year note was 99 - 24 / 32 , up 1 / 32 , to yield 6 . 01 percent . The 10 - year was up 7 / 32 at 99 - - 11 / 32 to yield 6 . 59 percent . The 30 - year bond was up 14 / 32 at 95 - 9 / 32 to yield 6 . 87 percent . Dealers said that Federal funds would open at 5 - 1 / 2 percent percent Friday . ( ( - - N . A .

Fed seen raising US rates to keep lid on inflation . With financial markets around the world riveted , Federal Reserve policy makers will gather this week to consider raising interest rates for the first time in more than two years . Central to that debate will be the question of whether the economy is moving ahead too quickly - - will low unemployment and increasingly tight labour markets bid up wages further and ultimately increase inflation ? After a series of comments over the past several weeks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , many experts have become convinced the Federal Open Market Committee will opt to raise rates at its meeting on Tuesday to try to slow the economy a little and head off inflation . Central bank officials are due to begin meeting at 9 a . m . EST ( 1400 GMT ) . If recent practice holds , the result of the meeting should be known around 2 : 15 p . m . ( 1915 GMT ) . At his most recent appearance last Thursday before Congress ' s Joint Economic Committee , Greenspan acknowledged that inflation was under control , but he repeatedly emphasised the need to act early to combat inflation . " Greenspan has strengthened his comments each time he has spoken about the probability that Fed would move sooner rather later if the economy didn ' t show signs of slowing , " said David Berson , chief economist at Fannie Mae , a company that pools home mortgages for sale on the secondary market . " It looks as though the chances are pretty good that the Fed will raise rates on Tuesday , " Berson added . Many lawmakers at Thursday ' s hearing appeared resigned to the prospect of a rate rise , as both Democratic and Republican officials attempted to persuade Greenspan that it was not needed given the low levels of inflation recently . U . S . stock and bond markets , which have suffered bouts of selling over the past few weeks in response to various comments from Greenspan and other Fed officials , are also braced for tighter credit . Nonetheless , many analysts believe that any decision to raise rates will be a difficult one for the Fed . Greenspan has repeatedly warned of the risks to inflation posed by tight labour markets , but , at the same time , has acknowledged that prices so far are very well behaved . " The state of inflation at this particular stage is clearly under control , " Greenspan said on Thursday . But he added , " What we at the Federal Open Market Committee are going to have to judge is . . . what is the state of the economy later this year and into 1998 when any actions we may or may not take would become effective ? " A Reuters poll , taken shortly after Greenspan wrapped up his testimony on Thursday , showed 34 of 48 U . S . economists expected a rise this week in the federal funds rate , which banks charge each other for overnight money . The funds rate , a benchmark for other short - term rates that is the Fed ' s main lever for influencing the economy , now stands at 5 . 25 percent . Most of those forecasting a rate rate rise look for a modest increase of a quarter percentage point . The last time the Fed raised rates was in February 1995 , when it completed the last of a series of increases that resulted in a doubling of the funds rate during 1994 to 1995 . While economists see little chance of such drastic action at this stage , many believe a rate rise on Tuesday could be followed by others . " The economy is simply growing too strongly , " said Lyle Gramley , a former Fed governor who is now consulting economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association . " We ' re not looking at another 1994 but if ( the Fed moves ) in March , it won ' t be the last one . "

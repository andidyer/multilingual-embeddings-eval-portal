RALLYING - MONTE CARLO TURNS ITS BACK ON GLORIOUS PAST . The oldest rally in the world has been chosen as the stage for the start of a new era but Monte Carlo lovers sadly sigh as concentration runs and Turini nights now belong to the past . To comply with a revolution in formats and rules aimed at making the sport more exciting , organisers of the winter classic have been forced to scrap two of the race ' s most cherished memories . " A Monte Carlo Rally without the concentration run and the Turini night is not quite the Monte Carlo , even if it remains a very special event , " three - times winner Didier Auriol of France said before the season opener started on Sunday . The concentration run , which saw the drivers set off from various cities in Europe to gather in Monaco , and the traditional night finale in the mountains overlooking the tiny principality have both been dropped to make the event shorter . When it all started , in 1911 , the concentration run was the race itself . The event was created to attract tourists to the chic seaside resort in the winter and to prove to them that the weather was nice and mild there in January . The concentration run then became a prelude to the race which effectively started in Monte Carlo after the drivers had completed a long and dangerous route . The Turini night is also part of the rally ' s legend as the race was often decided there . In 1973 , Frenchman Bernard Darniche , in his navy blue Lancia Stratos , entered the final night over six minutes behind leader Bjorn Waldegaard of Sweden . But a risky choice of tyres and almost reckless driving allowed him to win the race the next morning with a meagre six - second lead over his rival . In 1986 , Finn Henri Toivonen had jeopardised his chances with a frightening crash on the penultimate day . But during the night he was in a class of his own behind the wheel of his Lancia Delta and he reached Monte Carlo as the winner . The Turini pass has not been omitted this year and when the drivers climb it on Wednesday , shortly before then end of the rally , it will be dark , but only just . In a gesture of goodwill to FIA officials , who dream of making rallying as spectacular as Formula One , organisers have decided to start and end this year ' s race with timed stages using a part of the famed Monaco Grand Prix circuit . " It ' s a bit bizarre , " said Auriol , too young to remember that the circuit has already been used several times by the rally from 1954 to 1964 . Things were returning to normal from Monday with tricky stages on narrow roads in the Ardeche mountains . Briton Colin McRae , the 1995 world champion , predicted that this year ' s race would be as hard as the previous ones . " This is one of the most unpredictable and difficult events , " said the Subaru driver . " The conditions change from one minute to the next , from tarmac to black ice and snow as you go higher up in the mountains and , as far as tactics are concerned , you just have to drive as fast as you can , as safely as possible . It ' s certainly a tough one to start the season . " After all , this year ' s Monte Carlo is perhaps not all that different . After Sunday ' s prologue , when the drivers left the playground for the rich and famous behind to head for far less glamorous settings , it would be much as before .

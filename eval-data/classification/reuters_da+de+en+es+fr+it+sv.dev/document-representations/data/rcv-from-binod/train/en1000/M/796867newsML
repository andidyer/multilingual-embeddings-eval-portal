ENERGIZED MEXICAN ECONOMY , POLITICS LURE US BUYERS . Solid economic fundamentals and newfound political pluralism lend Mexican debt markets more allure than those of other comparably - yielding Latin American countries , U . S . investors said . Spread compression has brought yields in countries such as Argentina and Panama near or inside Mexico ' s . But the intersection of risk and yield makes Mexico more attractive , investors said . " There doesn ' t seem to be anything in the foreseeable future that could be going wrong in Mexico , " said a portfolio manager at a New York - based emerging markets debt fund . " There ' s still a lot of foreign direct investment coming into the country , growth is still doing well . . . and the peso seems fairly stable , " he said . In recent days , Argentina Brady bond spreads have tightened to levels just above those of Mexico Bradies , while two fairly comparable global bonds - - Argentina 2017 and Mexico 2016 - - traded within a few basis points of each other . Mexico , however , maintains long - term foreign currency ratings of Ba2 from Moody ' s Investors Service and double - B from Standard & Poor ' s . Argentina holds the same double - B S & P rating , but Moody ' s rates it two notches lower at B1 . In light of the ratings discrepancy , Mexico looks cheap , said Peter Lannigan , portfolio manager of the Phoenix Emerging Markets Bond Fund . Lannigan said he likes the longer - dated Mexican Eurobonds and globals , as well as the paper of what he called " economically sensitive " corporates . Among others , Lannigan said he holds bonds of truckmaker Dina , conglomerate Vitro and railroad operator Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana ( TFM ) . " There ' s a theme there : companies whose revenues are sensitive to Mexico ' s economy , " he said . Such corporates allow investors to bet on the Mexican macroeconomic scenario while receiving yields higher than those of the sovereign debt , Lannigan said . " If I can get at least 50 to 70 basis points more . . . than that country ' s government debt , I ' ll start to take a look , " he said . Mexico ' s economy expanded 5 . 1 percent in 1996 after the sharp contraction in 1995 , and it appears primed for GDP growth of 5 . 0 percent or more in 1997 , according to economist forecasts . The country plans to release its second - quarter GDP figures next Tuesday . " Last year we were looking at strong growth in the export sector , . . . ( and ) now you have the economic recovery broadening out to include the consumer , " Lannigan said . Besides an improved economy , Mexico now boasts a more - diversified political system . Opposition candidates won a majority of seats in the lower house of Congress for the first time in the July elections , loosening the grip of the entrenched Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . This week Mexico ' s four opposition parties formed a majority voting bloc that should allow them to choose the next speaker of the House . While potholes surely lurk on the road to a functioning democracy , the elections represent a positive long - term development in Mexico ' s credit quality , said Jeff Kaufman , a portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial Services . " It is a long - term credit positive , but in the short term there are dicey moments , " he said . " If you truly believe in the long - term story and you ' re willing to ride out volatility , . . . then I ' d buy the UMS ' 26 - - that ' s going to give you the best total return on a one - to 10 - year horizon . " Mexico looks expensive compared to higher - yielding Brazil and Venezuela , but its debt appears attractive next to the similar spreads of Argentina and Panama , Kaufman said .

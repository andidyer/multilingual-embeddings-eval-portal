Burmah says currency hit could triple in 97 . Burmah Castrol said on Monday the negative impact of the pound ' s strength could be three times as big in 1997 as last year if the currency stayed at current levels . The pound held back profit growth in 1996 by three percentage points to 10 percent . " If the rates stay where they are at the moment , than we are talking about nine percent as opposed to the three percent which it ( the pound ) cost us in 1996 , " chief executive Jonathan Fry told a telephone conference . Fry said the currency impact would be bigger in 1997 than last year because the pound only started to strengthen significantly against the dollar and several other currencies in the second half of 1996 . But profits were only hit because of the translation of local currency profits abroad in pounds . The currency ' s strength did not hurt underlying business , Fry stressed . Burmah earlier reported that profit after tax before exceptional items rose to 148 . 7 million stg from 135 . 0 million with the currency impact more than offset by one - off tax savings . These tax benefits of a total 6 . 3 million stg stemmed from an unusual opportunity to pay all rather than half of the final dividend as a foreign income dividend , the company said . Operating profits in the lubricants rose to 210 . 3 million stg from 204 . 1 , while results in the chemicals division were up at 66 . 3 million stg from 62 . 5 . Business remains booming in developing regions such as Asia and Latin America , where Burmah plans unspecified investments in extra staff and advertising , which will dampen immediate profit growth . " It does take out some of the fizz out of the short term figures , but we believe it is right for the future of the business , " Fry said . Trading conditions remain sluggish in mature markets and Fry does not expect any major improvement in Europe this year . Governments are putting a break on economic growth as they struggle to meet tight budget criteria required for European Monetary Union , Fry said . " As the economies try to recover the governments are taking the potential bounce out of them , " he said . " I don ' t foresee in northern Europe , particularly in Germano centric Europe , any real improvement . " Burmah wants to make some divestments in its chemical operations , where it wants to sell off operations " at the fringes of its core operations , " Fry said . Burmah may also wants to make acquisitions , but does see the need for any major moves .

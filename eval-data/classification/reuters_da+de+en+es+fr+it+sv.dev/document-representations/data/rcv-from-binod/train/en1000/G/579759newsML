Sri Lanka launches offensive in rebel heartland . Sri Lankan troops launched an offensive against separatist Tamil rebels in the north of the island on Tuesday to open a land route to a strategic government - held Jaffna town , military officials said . Troops , backed by helicopter gunships , artillery and tanks , broke out of their bases in Vavuniya , 220 km ( 135 miles ) north of the capital Colombo at first light and headed towards the rebel - held Wanni region further up north , they said . " Troops have launched the offensive . They have begun to move towards the LTTE - controlled areas in the north , " a military official in the north told Reuters . It was not immediately known if advancing troops had encountered resistance from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels , who control vast swathes of land in the mostly shrub jungle Wanni region . Last July , government forces advanced further south of Jaffna , moving about 20 km ( 12 miles ) down from the peninsula to Kilinochchi , forcing their way into the rebel heartland . The current offensive plans to link Kilinochchi with Vavuniya , establishing a military land supply route all the way to Jaffna . The Defence Ministry had no comment . A military spokesman in Colombo said details of troop movements were just begining to reach the capital . Military officials in the north said a large number of troops had begun moving north from three places and were most likely heading towards Mankulam , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) north of Vavuniya . The main aim of the offensive , code - named " Jaya Sikurui " , or " Sure of Victory " , was to open a land supply route linking Vavuniya and the Jaffna peninsula , about 100 km ( 60 miles ) further north , they said . Civilians and aid workers in Vavuniya told Reuters the town was rocked by army artillery fire ahead of the advance . " Air force planes have been taking on known rebel targets in the Wanni region since Monday to soften up the ground for foot soldiers on Tuesday , " another military official said . Officials said the military has been preparing for the offensive since initial plans for one early last month were scrapped due to logistical problems . Spokesmen for the LTTE , which is fighting a 13 - year war for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of Sri Lanka , were not immediately available for comment . But the rebels said earlier they were prepared to face the offensive . The military currently relies on air and sea transport to send troops and supplies to bases in the Jaffna peninsula , a former rebel stronghold captured by the forces in April 1996 . This is the year ' s second major offensive undertaken by government forces . In February they captured another key land route from the rebels , linking Vavuniya with the town of Mannar in the island ' s west coast . The rebels did not offer much resistance to advancing troops during that offensive , which was carried out over a period of 17 days . The government says more than 50 , 000 people have died in the conflict , but the LTTE says the toll is higher .

United News buys 20 pct stake in HTV . United News & Media Plc said on Friday it agreed to buy Scottish Television Plc ' s 19 . 9 percent stake in HTV Group Plc for 73 . 7 million stg . Britain ' s HTV Group , which operates the third television channel licence for for Wales and the west of England , conceded earlier this month that it was a bid target . United News said it regarded the put and call agreement it had entered into with Scottish TV as an investment and had no plans to make an offer for the rest of HTV ' s share capital . The group added it has also agreed to buy Scottish TV ' s holdings In Independent Television News Ltd ( ITN ) , of which Scottish TV owns five percent . Buying all of this would give United News a 22 percent stake in ITN . Scottish TV is to receive 5 . 1 million stg for its ITN stake , which will be used to reduce the company ' s borrowings after buying Caledonian and finance development of its media strategy . HTV reported pre - tax profits of 12 . 1 million stg on turnover of 135 . 0 million for the year to end December 1995 . HTV ' s market capitalisation was about 328 million stg at the close on Oct 24 . " United and HTV already work together across a range of areas and this investment will strengthen the relationship , " said United News in a statement . The put and call arrangements may not be exercised before November 1 , shortly after which the deal should be completed . " ITV ( independent television ) is the core of our broadcasting business , " said Roger Laughton , chief executive of United Broadcasting and Entertainment . " This investment gives us the opportunity to work more closely with HTV in the interests of strengthening the network as a whole , " he said . Scottish TV ' s holdings in HTV and ITN had at the end of June book values of 35 . 9 million stg and 1 . 1 million respectively . " The disposal of our investments in HTV and ITN at a good premium will put us in a position of significant financial strength , " said Scottish TV chairman Gus Macdonald . " This flexibility will enable us to continue with our strategy of building a broader - based media business , " he said . The purchase of Caledonian Publishing for about 120 million stg , cleared by the UK government earlier this month , is part of this drive and the profit of 41 . 2 million stg from the latest proposed sales will reduce debt to enable further expansion . Caledonian Publishing owns Glasgow ' s Herald and Evening Times newspapers . - - London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 7717

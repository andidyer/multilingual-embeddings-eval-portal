France clashes with European Parliament . France lashed out at the European Parliament on Wednesday for criticising a disputed immigration bill and Foreign Minister Herve de Charette outraged the assembly ' s president by saying it was " not worthy of the name " . The parliament last week narrowly adopted a resolution urging France to withdraw a bill proposed by Interior Minister Jean - Louis Debre to further clamp down on illegal immigration . The call , inserted in a resolution " on racism , xenophobia and the extreme right " , was proposed by leftist French members and adopted by 106 - 101 votes . De Charette said in a television interview : " Once again , I have to say with regret . . . that the European Parliament shows that it is not yet a parliament worthy of the name . " " It ' s very shocking that the parliament lets itself become involved in things that don ' t concern it , by that I mean French legislation , " he said . European Parliament president Jose - Maria Gil - Robles of Spain , on an inaugural visit to France , threatened to cancel a planned meeting with de Charette unless he clarified his remark . Gil - Robles said in a statement that the comment was " an unacceptable judgement on the European Parliament , its role and its dignity " and he " would like to believe the terms used went beyond the minister ' s thoughts " . Officials said the coordinated French attack , launched by President Jacques Chirac , suggested Paris would oppose any increase in the Strasbourg - based legislature ' s powers in the current reform of European Union institutions . Germany , France ' s closest EU partner , traditionally advocates extending the parliament ' s role . The verbal clash also gave France ' s Gaullist rulers an opportunity to rally mainstream conservative and hard right voters behind a nationalist banner in the face of an assembly which the French have traditionally disdained . Chirac , who slammed " unacceptable interference " in France ' s internal affairs when he met Gil - Robles on Tuesday , nurses bitter memories of a hostile reception over French nuclear testing when he addressed the parliament in July 1995 . Leftist and ecologist parliamentarians heckled and jeered him in the Strasbourg chamber , chanting " No No No " and waving banners bearing a mushroom cloud and the word " Non " in French . French officials warned at the time that what they regarded as the childish , unparliamentary behaviour would have a sequel when the time came to review the roles of EU institutions in the so - called Inter - governmental Conference . The opposition Socialists accused Chirac on Wednesday of diversionary tactics . " It ' s not the first time Jacques Chirac has attacked the European Parliament to try to distract attention from his domestic problems . He did it at the time of the nuclear tests , " Socialist Euro - deputy Elisabeth Guigou told a news conference . " This instance shows again the hostility of part of the French coalition to the European Parliament . It ' s a premeditated offensive , " the former European affairs minister said . De Charette said the immigration bill was " fair and just " and rejected suggestions it might damage France ' s image abroad . The bill would close loopholes in existing tough immigration laws that left some immigrants in a legal limbo - - if they have children born in France they can neither be deported nor obtain legal status . It would extend controls on non - European visitors to France , allowing fingerprinting , the impounding of passports and tighter reporting of departures . " There is a problem with immigration in France , " de Charette said . " If you go to Japan , if you go to the United States , there are laws on immigration . You can ' t break them . In France they ' re broken every day . "

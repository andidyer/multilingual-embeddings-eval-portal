Rwanda denies incursion into Zaire . The Rwandan army denied on Monday reports that unidentified fighters had crossed from its territory overnight and attacked army positions in east Zaire , where fighting has intensified between Zaire ' s army and Tutsi rebels . Spokesman Major Wilson Rutayisire , speaking to Reuters in the Rwandan capital Kigali , also denied accusations that Rwanda ' s Tutsi - dominated army was arming the increasingly successful Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis in destabilising eastern Zaire . The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis who came to Zaire from Rwanda at the end of the 18th century . " If these people ( Banyamulenge ) are picking up arms and helping themselves , that is one thing . But we are not involved in operations in north or south Kivu , " Rutayisire said . " We are not arming the Banyamulenge . Their arms are coming from Zaire where it is easy to find them . " Aid agency sources in Kigali had earlier told Reuters unidentified gunmen entered Zaire from Rwanda overnight and attacked government army positions close to Rwandan refugee camps in the eastern Zairean town of Goma . In Geneva , the U . N . refugee agency confirmed the attacks by gunmen near Katale refugee camp , the largest Rwandan Hutu refugee camp in the region and home to 202 , 000 people .

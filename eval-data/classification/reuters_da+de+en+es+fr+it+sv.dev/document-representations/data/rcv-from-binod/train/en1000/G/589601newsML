Zairean rebels reject Kinshasa transition moves . Zairean rebels dismissed on Friday a power shuffle dropping President Mobutu Sese Seko in the capital Kinshasa and urged Zairean troops to lay down their arms . Bizima Karaha , the " foreign minister " of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo - Zaire ( AFDL ) , told a news conference in the southeast city of Lubumbashi the rebel leadership rejected Friday ' s announcement from Kinshasa . " Power would remain in the hands of the government and parliament according to their constitution - - a constitution which does not actually exist in this country . " " For that reason the AFDL , after the meeting we had of the executive committee chaired by the president ( rebel leader Laurent Kabila ) , decided that we reject categorically those declarations of those irresponsible people in Kinshasa , " he said . Government spokesman Kin - Kiey Mulumba said earlier in a cabinet statement that Mobutu was stepping aside from affairs of state but would retain the title of president . Kin - Kiey said Kisangani Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo , a key player early in Zaire ' s democratic transition , would negotiate with rebel leader Kabila on a transitional government and elections . " Our constitution institutes a parliamentary regime during the period of transition . The president reigns but he does not govern , " the statement said , illustrating Mobutu ' s determination not to cede his title as head of state . Speaking after a cabinet meeting , he said Mobutu ' s emergency rule prime minister , General Likulia Bolongo , was in charge . Mobutu , who has ruled Zaire for 32 years , left Kinshasa earlier on Friday for his northern jungle palace at Gbadolite , triggering intense speculation that he was going into exile . Before Karaha spoke , rebel officials earlier cheerfully announced that Kabila would hold a news conference on Friday . The conference was twice delayed and then Karaha took his place . He read a brief statement and answered two questions . Karaha said Mobutu loyalists in the capital clearly wanted to see bloodshed and that they would bear responsibility for it . Asked if the rebels planned to advance on Kinshasa , he said : " We believe that the people in Kinshasa deserve to be liberated and need to be liberated more than ever before . " The rebels have seized three quarters of the country and the Zairean army has shown little inclination to challenge them . The last big engagement was last week around Kenge town , 200 km ( 125 miles ) east of Kinshasa . Karaha appealed to what he called the remains of Mobutu ' s army to lay down their arms , stop fighting and await instructions which the rebel leader would announce on Saturday . " We ask our population in all the country , specifically in Kinshasa , to stay in their houses , be calm and not to do anything to jeopardise the situation in Kinshasa , " he added . Kabila had insisted that Mobutu hand power directly to his alliance . But he had agreed in talks with President Nelson Mandela in South Africa on Thursday to give Mobutu until Monday to study the proposals . Asked if he would halt the rebel advance on Kinshasa , Kabila replied : " I have nothing to say about it . "

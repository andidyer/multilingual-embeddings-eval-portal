Blaze guts house in Germany , arson ruled out . Fire gutted a four - storey apartment house in the western German city of Essen early on Monday , injuring 21 of its 60 mainly foreign residents , German police said . But police said they had ruled out initial suspicions they were dealing with a case of arson . They said the fire probably started when two sofas on the stairway of the house went up in flames , although it was still unclear why . Earlier , police said the blaze had taken place in an asylum - seekers ' home where 57 refugees were registered but where about 100 people were living at the time of the fire . Later they said the building had been an apartment house with about 60 residents , mainly foreigners , registered there . Fires in homes and hostels used by foreigners have provoked concern in the past about a renewal of the wave of arson attacks on them by right - wing extremists that took place after German unification in 1990 .

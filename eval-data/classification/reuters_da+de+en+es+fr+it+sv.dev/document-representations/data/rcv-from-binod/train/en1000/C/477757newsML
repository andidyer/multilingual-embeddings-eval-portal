China accountant shortage delays annual reports . A shortage of accountants in China is causing delays in the issuing of 1996 results by listed firms , Shanghai Securities News said on Monday . The number of firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses has grown quickly but the number of qualified accountants has not increased at all in the past year , it said . The number of firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange at the end of 1996 was 293 , a year - on - year increase of 105 , the newspaper said . By contrast , there are less than 21 qualified auditors at five accounting firms in the city authorised by the China Securities Regulatory Commission , it said . All listed companies are required to publish their 1996 results by April 30 , but less than half of the 530 firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have yet to do so . The newspaper said stricter requirements mean it now takes longer to audit an annual report than it did last year , another reason for the delay .

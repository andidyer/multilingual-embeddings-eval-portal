Upside scope seen limited with selling expected on any short - covering . The Australian dollar was looking vulnerable to further losses after U . S . - led selling saw the unit plunge one cent to US $ 0 . 7295 , its lowest level since July 1995 . While the Aussie had edged back above US $ 0 . 7300 in early local trade , the bounce lacked conviction and traders said the unit had a heavy look about it with the unit more likely to continue its five month downtrend than rally strongly . A shortcovering rally in local trading could see the unit continue to edge higher on the day , but sellers were expected to appear on any rallies , and traders said the unit was more likely to test US $ 0 . 7250 before US $ 0 . 7350 . By 8 . 00 a . m . ( 2200 GMT ) the Australian dollar was licking its wounds at US $ 0 . 7304 / 09 , down from a local Thursday close of US $ 0 . 7355 / 60 , and well below its overnight high of US $ 0 . 7395 . " The drop below US $ 0 . 7310 - - last year ' s low , and US $ 0 . 7315 - - this year ' s earlier low , has warned that the next bearish phase in the overall decline from 80 cents is underway , " said Darren Spain , global foreign exchange analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York . The impetus for the fall was heavy New York selling , and traders said the ongoing uncertainty over official interest rate moves remained a weight on the Australian dollar . Thursday ' s July labour force data did little to clear up the rate outlook , with those who see the easing cycle having ended pointing to the solid 52 , 500 rise in full - time employment . Against this , those who see room for another rate cut used continuing high unemployment - - 8 . 7 percent in June - - and the sluggish pace of overall employment as support for their case . While the uncertainty remains , the dollar is likely to maintian a bias to the downside , analysts said . " Our target over the next week for this decline is the US $ 0 . 7185 / 7210 area , " Spain said . " Only a recovery back above US $ 0 . 7340 would delay further weakness . " Against the yen , the Australian dollar was also weaker , falling to 86 . 53 / 63 yen in early trade from a Thursday close of 87 . 20 / 30 . Although not normally a concern of the market , June housing finance data today might cause some reaction as it is expected to show a large fall for the second successive month . Given housing was expected to be one of the strongest areas of the economy in 1997 , signs of weakness may cause some further speculation that easing cycle has not yet ended . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 1800

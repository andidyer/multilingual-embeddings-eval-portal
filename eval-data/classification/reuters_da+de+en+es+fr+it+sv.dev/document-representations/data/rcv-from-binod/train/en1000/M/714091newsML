Sentiment mixed as to where Brady bonds are headed . Sentiment was mixed on Tuesday as to where emerging market debt would head . Some dealers said spreads would continue to tighten amid low volatility and a well - bid market but others expressed concern that the U . S . long bond hitting 6 . 55 was a signal to take profit . " 6 . 55 on the long bond is rich , a bell for the bottom of the market . We think that ' s now the yield low for the second half of 1997 and people should start shortening up , there is not much more headroom , " BankAmerica analyst Richard Gray said . " Its possible that a combination of weaker Treasury markets and wider spreads is a double whammy for emerging markets , " he added . At 0953 GMT , the 30 - year benchmark T - bond yielded 6 . 59 percent . " People have started to pile out , " Gray said . The largest profit - taking was seen on the Brazil and Mexico ' s bonds , dealers said . But bullishness continued on Argentina on comments by economy minister Roque Fernandez that Argentina would consider buying back some of its Brady bonds . There was also continued optimism on eastern Europe debt . " Continued talk of a buy - back is boosting Argentina and there is good fundamental value in Russia , " a dealer said . " Eastern Europe is behaving differently , " he added . " Russia and Bulgaria have more room to move up . " While other dealers seemed convinced that over the coming days spreads would continue to tighten . - - Hayley Pienaar , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7718

FOCUS - Schwarz Pharma ups bullish 97 outlook . German drugs group Schwarz Pharma AG on Wednesday upped its already bullish profit forecast for 1997 after the weaker mark and new products boosted export earnings in the first half . The company reported a 31 percent rise in group after - tax profit to 68 . 5 million marks in the six months to June 30 as global sales rose 7 . 6 percent to 632 . 8 million , despite a continued decline in domestic business . Foreign business would continue to " more than compensate " for weak domestic demand in the second half of the year , Schwarz Pharma said , as it forecast five percent sales growth for the full year . The company looked for earnings per share of 5 . 10 marks by the end of the year , up from 4 . 49 marks last year . In April , Schwarz Pharma was predicting 1997 EPS of 4 . 90 marks . The privately - owned drugs group , which generates more than half of its business abroad and nearly a quarter in the U . S . , said some 24 . 5 million marks in sales were generated by developments on foreign exchange markets .

The company ' s shares traded down 2 . 80 marks to 141 marks after the news in a broadly steady market . Analysts have said they fear the company will face considerable competition for its products in the future . Schwarz Pharma said its product acquisitions were strongly focused on the U . S . during the first half of the year . U . S . sales rose 24 percent to 153 . 7 million marks , while other foreign sales advanced 19 . 3 percent to 202 . 5 million .

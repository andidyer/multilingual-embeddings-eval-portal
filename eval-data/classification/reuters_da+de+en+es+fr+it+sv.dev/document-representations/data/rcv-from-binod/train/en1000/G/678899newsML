HK ' s future leader seen favouring Beijing - - poll . Hong Kong people who believe the territory ' s future leader Tung Chee - hwa represents Beijing ' s interests outnumber those who believe he represents local interests , a poll released on Sunday showed . Nonetheless , a Time / CNN poll conducted two weeks before the British colony ' s handover to China at midnight on June 30 showed local people overwhelmingly thought reunification would benefit Hong Kong . The survey of 800 Hong Kong people aged 18 and above found that 63 percent of respondents thought the handover would be good for the territory . Just 10 percent thought it would be bad . A similar 61 percent trusted China ' s promise to allow Hong Kong to keep its separate economic and political system for 50 years after the handover , against 30 percent who did not . But 39 percent of respondents said Tung Chee - hwa , who was chosen by a China - backed committee to become Hong Kong ' s Chief Executive on July 1 , represented Beijing ' s interests , while 34 percent said he represents Hong Kong ' s . However , half of those surveyed agreed with Tung that social stability should take precedence over democracy , against 24 percent who disagreed . Tung ' s personal popularity had dipped in recent months after the incoming administration put in place plans to roll back key civil liberties and replace the fully elected legislature with a provisional council chosen by a Beijing - backed committee . But the Time / CNN poll found that 59 percent of respondents had a favourable impression of Tung , although he was beaten out in the popularity stakes by his deputy , top civil servant Anson Chan , at 74 percent . Chan has also served as deputy to outgoing British Governor Chris Patten . A separate poll by the South China Morning Post released on Sunday found that support for Hong Kong ' s democracy camp was rising in the runup to the handover . Some 43 . 8 percent of those who answered backed the Democratic Party , up from 39 . 5 percent last month , it said . Adding the supporters of three smaller parties , the democratic camp had the support of 68 . 7 percent of those answering . But the paper said 37 percent of the total sample of 634 people expressed no opinion on whom they would vote for if an election were held now . The Democratic Party was the major winner of the 1995 polls that resulted in Hong Kong ' s first , fully - elected legislature . But China said electoral reforms which permitted those polls violated previous Sino - British accords and vowed to scrap the current legislature . When the Beijing - backed provisional council takes over on July 1 , the Democratic Party will be absent .

Saga says Vigdis oilfield down until end - June . Saga Petroleum ASA said on Tuesday the North Sea Vigdis oilfield would remain shut in until the end of June due to a fabrication fault in the gas compressor . Production at the development was closed down on May 23 after a gas leak was detected in the compressor train . Saga spokesman Bjoern Schibevaag said the leak was traced back to a design fault in the equipment that had caused damaged to the compressor . " Our plans point to a restart in production at the end of June , " Schibevaag told Reuters . Vigdis , which came on stream in January five months ahead of schedule , suffered an unscheduled shutdown on April 15 due to other problems with the gas compressor . The field was restarted on May 16 . Output was around 50 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) before the latest incident , but peak output is planned to reach around 75 , 000 bpd . - - Tanya Pang , Oslo newsroom , + 47 22 42 50 41

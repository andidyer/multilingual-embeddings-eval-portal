Canadian firm signs Ukraine power plant deal . A Canadian power firm struck a deal to operate and eventually own a Ukrainian electricity plant on Thursday which would make it the first Western company to break into the former Soviet republic ' s state - run energy sector . Northland Power is seeking funding for the $ 110 million joint - venture deal signed during a visit by Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy . " This would be one of the largest projects , if not one of the biggest foreign investments in independent Ukraine , " Canadian Ambassador Christopher Westdal said during the signing ceremony to form the Ukr - Can Power company . Northland spent four years negotiating with the Ukrainian government and energy authorities to run Kiev ' s Darnytsia plant , the company ' s President James Temerty said . The Canadian side would raise the $ 110 million from lending bodies , export development agencies , Western commercial banks and private sources , he said . " This breaks the log - jam on energy restructuring , " Westdal said . The deal followed the approval earlier this month of a $ 317 million World Bank loan to help create a competitive electricity market in Ukraine , where power cuts are common . Temerty said his Toronto - based power company would operate the gas - powered plant , and then take over 51 percent of shares when a new on - site facility was completed . " Once all of this is done we build the plant and turn it into a commercial operation , " Temerty told Reuters , adding that it would probably take two years . The deal was part of a package agreed during a visit by Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of Canada , which has a big Ukrainian diaspora and has formed strong links with Ukraine . Five years since gaining independence , Kiev continues to maintain tight control over " strategic " enterprises . Ukraine has attracted only about $ 1 . 5 billion in investment since the Soviet Union collapsed , and investors complain of an unfriendly and bureaucratic investment climate . The Ukrainian side will continue to run the plant , which provides steam to several local industries and heating and hot water to about 300 , 000 residents . Northland is to manage the plant until the new ownership arrangement is reached . It is awaiting Western cash to shut down its Chernobyl power plant , which still provides five percent of the country ' s electricity needs despite the 1986 explosion there which spread a cloud of radiation across much of Europe .

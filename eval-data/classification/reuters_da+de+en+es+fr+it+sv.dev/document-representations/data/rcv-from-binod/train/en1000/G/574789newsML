Growing Turkish - Israeli ties bury Islamist dream . Turkey ' s generals , flexing their considerable political muscle , have buried Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan ' s dream of closer ties to the Moslem world under a flurry of security deals with rival Israel . An agreement last week by Turkey ' s top brass for joint naval exercises with the Jewish state and the United States marked an end to any " eastward " drift in Turkey ' s foreign policy under Erbakan , its first elected Islamist leader . In doing so , the commanders reinforced their campaign to undermine the prime minister ' s 11 - month tenure and end what they see as a threat to the secular republic . At the same time , they have served notice on regional rivals - - Syria , Iran and Iraq - - that Turkey views its security interests as anchored to Washington and its close ally Israel . " The military stepped in after Erbakan began making statements or visits seen as changing the ( pro - Western ) orientation of Turkish policy , " said foreign affairs analyst Sami Kohen . " In Turkey ' s strategic assessment Syria , Iran and Iraq all pose threats , " Kohen told Reuters . " If Syria , Iran and Iraq pose threats for Turkey , they also pose threats for Israel . " Talk of manoeuvres , close on the heels of a defence training pact and the upgrading of Turkish jets by Israeli technicians , has underscored Erbakan ' s helplessness before a military that has deposed three governments in four decades . His Welfare Party promised to end all cooperation with Israel and to supplant Turkey ' s pro - Western orientation with warmer ties to the Arab and Moslem East . However , bilateral ties to the Jewish state have flourished under the army ' s patronage throughout Erbakan ' s term in office , unnerving his grassroots support . " Whose Decision Is It ? " demanded a headline in the Islamist daily Yeni Safak . A senior Welfare leader told reporters the government had not been consulted and dismissed the joint exercises as " unnecessary " . " The military has won a concrete victory against the government for dominance in foreign policy , " wrote columnist Mustafa Karaalioglu in Yeni Safak . " The picture coming to light is that of Turkey forming a bloc against the Moslem states . " Turkey and Israel have taken pains to stress the manoeuvres , planned for the eastern Mediterranean , were not aimed at any third party . Few at home or abroad see it that way . " It is not difficult to guess the common enemies : Iran , Syria and Iraq , " said commentator Ismet Berkan . " One of the factors bringing Turkey closer to Israel is a common ' threat . ' " Meanwhile , there is increasing unease across the Middle East at the growing prospect of an alliance between Israel and NATO - member Turkey , both potent military powers . Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al - Sahaf sharply criticised plans for naval exercises . " Iraq strongly denounces these manoeuvres and considers them a provocative and hostile act against the Arab nation , " Sahaf said in a statement carried by Iraqi newspapers on Friday . Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez said last week his country was deeply concerned with the U . S . - Turkish - Israeli alliance . And Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi told a crowd at Friday prayers in Kano , Nigeria , that Israel was preparing to launch attacks on the Arabs from Turkish bases . From the perspective of the Turkish establishment , such grumbling is a small price to pay for the potential pay - off from cozying up to the Jewish state : - - Israel , unlike the United States and Europe , can meet Turkey ' s demands for advanced weaponry without fear of powerful lobbies concerned with human rights abuses by Turkish security forces . - - Both countries are keen to exchange intelligence over threats of political violence . - - Each faces territorial claims from Syria . Israel remains in a formal state of war with Syria , while Damascus has never relinquised its claim to a southern Turkish province . - - Both aspire to transform already close bilateral ties with the United States into what Iraeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called " a triangle of strong forces in the Middle East against any threat of extremist elements .

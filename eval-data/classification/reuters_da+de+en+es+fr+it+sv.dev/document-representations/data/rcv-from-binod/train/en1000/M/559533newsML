BRAZIL DEBT OUTLOOK - Into Brazil , out of Argentina . Underperforming Brazilian Bradies and Eurobonds looked like a good bargain this week , especially when compared with Argentine bonds whose spreads have narrowed to near record - tight levels , market watchers said . In Eurobond trade last week , Brazil ' s global benchmark lagged well behind Argentine and Mexican issues , both of which were strengthened by sharp gains in the Brady market . Brazil ' s 8 . 875 percent due 2001 ZQ4P , its five - year global bond , ended the week at 181 basis points over U . S . Treasuries . That was 21 bps wider than Argentina ' s five - year global , the 9 . 25 percent due 2001 NZ4D , which narrowed to 160 bps over , one of its tighest levels ever . A few months ago , Brazil ' s global would sometimes trade narrower than Argentina ' s . But Brazil ' s fundamental outlook - - tarnished by growing fears over its external accounts - - has deteriorated in recent months . Also , recent changes in the way Standard & Poor ' s Corp determines credit risk in dollar - linked economies like Argentina ' s - - which allows corporates to receive higher credit ratings than the sovereign - - was seen boosting Argentina over its neighbors . Still , traders said the Argentine global was considered pricey at a spread of 160 bp over . That is just five basis points wider than Mexico ' s 9 . 75 percent due 2001 ZM5W , which usually trades between 15 and 25 basis points narrower than Argentina . Swapping out of Argentina and into Brazil also looked promising in the Brady market , dealers said . ONE BRADY SWAP TO CONSIDER : Move out of Argentine FRBS and into Brazilian EIs . " Argentina is now $ 2 . 00 more than Brazil and they should trade evenly or plus or minus 50 cents , " said Pedro Barbosa , chief Brady trader at ING Bank in Brazil . Market watchers said a move into EIs and other floating rate paper also made sense from a Brazilian fundamental angle : Namely , the fiscal and external account pictures will probably get worse before they get better , encouraging moves into shorter duration assets from Cs and Pars . EUROBOND PRIMARY MARKET ACTIVITY was expected to be light due to a bank holiday in London on Monday and a holiday in many European countries on Thursday . No Brazilian issues were seen pricing this week . Banco BMC was scheduled to launch its $ 50 million eight - year Eurobond , with both puts and calls after three and five years , sometime next week , according to lead manager West Merchant Bank . Spread talk is 380 bp to 410 bp over , priced to the three - year put . Traders said Brazil ' s 20 - year , sovereign 500 billion lire deal , originally expected in May , was not seen pricing until June , to give it some distance from its recently launched sovereign parrallel bond and Mexican and Argentine lire deals . PARALLEL PERFORMANCE - Brazil ' s 6 . 625 percent parrallel bond , comprised of three European currencies , got off to a slow start with retail clients after its launch last week . But it gained some momentum during the week , traders said . The parallel bond ' s Dutch guilder tranche ZXHE tightened during the week to close seven bp tighter at a dollar swap rate of 184 bp over . The French franc issue ZXGU was trading above its reoffer rate , at about 190 bp over U . S . Treasuries when swapped to the dollar . The Austrian schilling tranche ZXHB was primarily placed in Austria and was not trading actively on screens , traders said . ( ( - - Sao Paulo newsroom , 5511 248 - 5414 ) )

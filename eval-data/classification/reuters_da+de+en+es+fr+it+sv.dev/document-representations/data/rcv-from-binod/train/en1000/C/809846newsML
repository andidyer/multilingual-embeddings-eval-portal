Moscow op needs risk premium - Stockmann . Finnish retailer and department store group Stockmann targets higher profitability in its Moscow operations than in Finland as a risk premium since the Russian economy is still uncertain , CEO Ari Heinio said on Tuesday . The rate of return on investment should be two digits , but " the times for three - digit return on investment , as we had when we started up in Moscow , have gone by , " Heinio told a news conference . He declined to give a specific target , but said return on investment in domestic department store operations was also at a two - digit rate . Stockmann announced earlier that it planned to open the first western department store in Moscow , with a total area of 6 , 700 square metres and 5 , 000 square metres for shopping , which would double its Russian sales . The Moscow department store would target annual net sales of 300 million markka . Hannu Penttila , head of Stockmann ' s department store division , said the group planned to continue running at least three of its four current Moscow outlets since they were all profitable . Stockmann ' s head of international operations Jukka Hienonen said no other western parties were planning department stores in Moscow , whereas Stockmann ' s unit would open in May . " There are shopping centre plans , even big , but none of them are suitable for department store operations , " he added . - - Helsinki Newsroom + 358 - 9 - 680 50 242 , news @ reuters . fi

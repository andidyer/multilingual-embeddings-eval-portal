RTRS - Australia receives further rainfall relief . Continued significant rainfall in August provided further relief to areas which had experienced rainfall deficiencies for the last 12 months , particularly in southern South Australia ( SA ) and southwest Victoria , the Bureau of Meteorology said . Serious to severe rainfall deficiencies that persisted in coastal areas of SA and near the Victorian border had been relieved somewhat with only small regions of serious deficiency remaining , director of meteorology John Zillman said . Also a small region in southwest Victoria previously identified as seriously deficient was no longer experiencing rainfall deficiencies , he said in a statement . Deficiencies were still evident in the Northern Territory , particularly west of Alice Springs and extending across the border into Western Australia . Some deficiencies were the most severe on record for the 12 month period ( September to August ) . Small regions of serious rainfall deficiency still existed around Katherine and to the southeast of Mount Isa in Queensland , he said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

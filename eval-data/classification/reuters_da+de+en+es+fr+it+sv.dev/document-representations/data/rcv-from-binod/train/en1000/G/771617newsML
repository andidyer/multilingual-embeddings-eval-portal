Dane Johnson ( 3 - 1 ) retired Geronimo Berroa to begin the 11th and got Cal Ripken to hit a routine grounder to first , but Jason Giambi ' s throw glanced off Johnson ' s glove , allowing Ripken to take second . Giambi had moved from the outfield to replace McGwire as first baseman . After B . J . Surhoff was intentionally walked , Jeffrey Hammonds was hit by a pitch , loading the bases . Walks to Hoiles and Ledesma made it 2 - 0 before Brady Anderson lined a 3 - 1 pitch into centre field , scoring Hammonds and Hoiles . Armando Benitez ( 1 - 3 ) struck out two in a perfect 10th for the victory and Randy Myers worked the 11th . Baltimore , which has won nine of 10 , lengthened its lead in the AL East to six games over the second - place New York Yankees . The Athletics , who acquired three pitchers for McGwire , suffered their sixth straight loss . In Anaheim , Dave Hollins ' s fielding error in the top of the ninth inning allowed Lyle Mouton to score the go - ahead run as the Chicago White Sox beat the Angels 14 - 12 .

Mike Cameron had a three - run homer and a career - high five RBI and former Angel Jorge Fabregas collected three hits , including a solo homer , for the White Sox . Todd Greene went 4 - for - 5 with a three - run homer and a pair of doubles and Jim Edmonds added a solo homer in the eighth for the Angels . In Detroit , Justin Thompson allowed two runs over seven innings and Brian Hunter scored in each of the first two innings as the Tigers posted a 4 - 2 victory over the slumping Toronto Blue Jays .

Israeli president postpones Jordan trip . Israeli President Ezer Weizman has postponed a scheduled visit to Amman on Thursday for talks with Jordan ' s King Hussein , palace officials said on Wednesday . They gave no reason for the postponement , but said it was an Israeli decision . Weizman visited Cairo on Monday on a goodwill mission aimed at convincing a sceptical Egypt that Israel is committed to peace despite demands by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change parts of agreements signed with the Palestinians . He had earlier met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , who has complained about Netanyahu ' s plans to revise a deal on the long - delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron . Jordan , Israel ' s closest ally since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1994 , has distanced itself from Netanyahu ' s government in recent weeks . King Hussein visited Arafat in the West Bank town of Jericho on Tuesday - - his first visit to the West Bank since he lost control of it during the 1967 Arab - Israeli War - - in a clear sign of support to the Palestinian leader .

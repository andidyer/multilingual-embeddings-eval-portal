Similar results for surgery or angioplasty - study . Heart disease patients with serious chest pain eventually have approximately the same medical bills and quality of life whether they are treated by angioplasty or bypass surgery , a study in Thursday ' s New England Journal of Medicine said . The study , which followed nearly 1 , 000 volunteers for about five - and - a - half years , found the differences between the two common treatment techniques were mostly technical . Bypass surgery seemed to produce a slightly better quality of life , at least for the first three years , especially for people with more than one severely narrowed artery , the study said . Angioplasty , a procedure where doctors try to reopen narrowed blood vessels with an inflatable balloon , may cost less for patients who have two narrowed blood vessels . Only among diabetics was the choice clear . The doctors conducting the new study , led by Dr . Mark A . Hlatky of the Stanford University School of Medicine , reported last year that heart patients with diabetes seemed to do better with bypass surgery . The latest research is part of an ongoing effort by doctors to weigh the pros and cons of the two techniques . The Hlatky study stemmed from a project known as BARI - - short for the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation . Last year , that project reported the survival rates were essentially the same regardless of which treatment was chosen . In comparing the costs of the two treatments and assessing the quality of life for the two groups , the Hlatky team found : - - Patients who undergo angioplasty , which is less traumatic to the body , return to work faster . But once bypass patients recover from their operation , they fare just as well on the job . - - Bypass patients may report a slightly better quality of life during the first few years , but that difference vanishes after three years . - - The initial cost of angioplasty may be 35 percent lower , but angioplasty patients tend to run up more medical bills in future years when their arteries need to be re - opened . After five years , the costs of the two treatments were essentially the same . - - There was no significant difference between the two groups in their emotional health . " On average , functional status was improved more with bypass surgery than with angioplasty in the first five years , whereas in other respects the quality of life was equivalent with either method , " the researchers concluded .

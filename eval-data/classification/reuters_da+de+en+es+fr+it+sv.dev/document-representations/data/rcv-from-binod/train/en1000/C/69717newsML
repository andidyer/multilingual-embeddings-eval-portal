US mulls new Native American gas royalty valuation . The U . S . Minerals Management Service on Monday proposed a new method for calculating royalties owed to Native American tribes for natural gas production on their lands . The proposal would allow royalties to be based on published index prices for production on Nativ American leases . Under existing rules , natural gas royalties are valued based on prices paid for a major portion of natural gas sold in a given month , or are based on comparisons of the value of natural gas at the wellhead and the value after the gas is processed . An MMS official said the existing system was difficult for producers to comply with because it required them to keep track of sales made by other producers . MMS annually collects about $ 150 million in royalties for Native American tribes . Comments on the proposal are due by November 22 . A final rule is not expected before May 1997 , the official said .

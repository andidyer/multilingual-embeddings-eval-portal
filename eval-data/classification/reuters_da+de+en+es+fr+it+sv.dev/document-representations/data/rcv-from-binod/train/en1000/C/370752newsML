Ireland ' s AIB says 1996 pre - tax profits up 13 pct . Ireland ' s largest banking group , Allied Irish Banks Plc , said on Tuesday that a strong performance in all divisions drove 1996 pre - tax profits up by 13 percent to 421 million punts ( $ 674 . 9 million ) . " The growth of 13 percent in pre - tax and attributable profits reflects a strong performance across all divisions and geographical areas of the group in a very competitive market , " chief executive Tom Mulcahy said in a statement . Profits at AIB Bank , the retail division with operations in Ireland , Northern Ireland and Britain , increased by 16 percent to 226 . 5 million in a strong lending environment . Lending in the Republic of Ireland rose by 19 . 6 percent while Northern Ireland saw loan growth of 12 . 6 percent and Britain reported lending growth of seven percent . Group financial director Kevin Kelly said while lending growth in Ireland would probably slow from last year ' s levels , the bank still expected double digit growth this year . Car finance and home mortgages in particular remained buoyant , he told Reuters in an interview . AIB said its capital markets division also did well , reporting a 14 percent rise in profits to 61 . 2 million , helped by the 1995 acquisition of UK fund manager John Govett which AIB said exceeded expectations . The U . S . division , which includes First Maryland Bancorp , reported an 11 percent rise in profits to 112 . 1 million Irish pounds ( $ 179 million ) while group profits , which include interest income earned on capital not allocated to divisions , totalled 21 . 0 million . Kelly said the 1996 results included some provision for Economic and monetary union . " We are assuming that it will happen and that Ireland is going in . We are preparing very actively and we are providing for the cost of it as we go along . " The bank , which announced in January that it was buying Pennsylvania bank Dauphin Deposit Corp for $ 1 . 36 billion , said it will continue to review the acquisition situation while bedding down Dauphin . " We have an open mind . If an opportunity arises we will look at it , " Kelly said . By 1025 GMT , the share price was down five pence at 460 but dealers said it had jumped five pence in late trade on Monday and was not suffering from some profit - taking . " They were a great set of results , well ahead of market expectations . All divisions showed good growth , the dividend was up 16 percent while earnings per share were up 12 percent , " one dealer said . ( $ = 0 . 626 Irish Punt )

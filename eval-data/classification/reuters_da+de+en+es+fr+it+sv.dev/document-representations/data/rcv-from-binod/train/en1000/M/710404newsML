Dollar seen sagging below 112 yen in Asia . The dollar could sag vs the yen in Asia on Tuesday due to concerns about Japan ' s rising trade surplus , with a fall below 112 yen in sight , dealers said . The dollar had already eased against the yen in early Asian trading after ending higher in New York on Monday due to short - covering . " The market is still choppy and there ' s a chance of the dollar ' s dive well below 112 . 00 yen , " said a trust bank dealer . He said speculators are willing to test the dollar ' s downside on the back of Japan ' s surging trade surplus , which could cause friction with the United States . Japanese exporters were expected to sell dollars near 113 yen , making the dollar top - heavy at around 112 . 80 yen , he said . A city bank dealer said caution about the talking up of the dollar by Japanese officials may grow if the greenback falls sharply below 112 yen . " There is a possibility that Japanese monetary authorities are likely to check the dollar ' s falls with words , " he added . Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka will hold a regular news briefing after Tuesday ' s cabinet meeting . " Since dollar short positions have been built up , short - covering may emerge after possible remarks by government officials , " he added . Japanese importers are likely to steadily buy dollars on falls , but their buying alone would be insufficient to support the dollar , said the city bank dealer . Life insurers , having refrained from buying the dollar on Monday , are expected to pick it up around 112 yen . Dealers said the mark is likely to fall below 64 yen in Tokyo in line with the dollar ' s decline against the yen and due to expectations of a weak euro .

Traders in Tokyo were not too bearish on the dollar against the mark , expecting it to edge up slowly .

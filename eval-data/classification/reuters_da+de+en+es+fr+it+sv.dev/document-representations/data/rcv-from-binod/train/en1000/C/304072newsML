Elf offered new Azeri oil deal . The president of Azerbaijan , on a visit to France , told a French newspaper on Monday his country would sign an oil exploration deal with Elf Aquitaine this week . The French oil giant has said it hopes to land a major new contract with Azerbaijan , which France ' s foreign minister Herve de Charette described last year as a new oil Eldorado . " Elf Aquitaine has been cooperating with us since last June . I have brought a second contract for Elf , " Azeri president Haydar Aliyev said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper . He was quoted as saying it would be signed in Paris during his visit this week . Elf had no official comment on Monday but the company said in December it hoped to land a contract to explore Azerbaijan ' s Lenkoran oil field during Aliev ' s planned visit to France . Azeri news reports say the offshore oil exploration deal is worth something like $ 2 billion . De Charette said in October when he visited the area that he had obtained " very precise " pledges about the role Elf could play on the Azeri oil fields , which have attracted a flood of Western investment since the collapse of the Soviet Union . Russia ' s Interfax news agency said on Monday the contract would cover two reserves - - Lenkoran - Deniz and Talysh - Deniz with estimated oil deposits of 80 to 100 million tonnes . Elf is expected to get an initial 75 percent and Azeri ' s state oil firm Socar 25 percent . Elf is then expected to farm out part of the contract to a consortium likely to include the other leading French group Total SA , with some 10 percent , Mobil Corp and Germany ' s Deminex . Elf signed its involvement in an earlier Caspian Sea oil project in June last year . Aliyev is in France for an official visit from January 13 to 15 , meeting French President Jacques Chirac on Monday .

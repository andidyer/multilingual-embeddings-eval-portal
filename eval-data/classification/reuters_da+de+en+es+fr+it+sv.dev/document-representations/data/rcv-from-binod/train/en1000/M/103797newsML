S . payrolls . * TCV to tender A $ 200 million of new 2008 stock on Wednesday . Australian bonds maintained their softer opening tone through the afternoon , falling to levels they were at before the release of U . S . payrolls last Friday . The A $ 600 million government bond tender added to the softer tone of the market , traders said , and although the market could weaken further , the underlying sentiment was still positive . " Probably a little more stock went to the street than people were expecting - - they probably hadn ' t done that much protection before the tender , " one trader said , adding this was because the market was wary of the tender being taken out by one player , as happened at the last government bond tender . " So they were probably a little reluctant to go in short , so we ' ve seen a bit of hedging since , but I think that ' s pretty much been digested now , " he said . The tender saw the A $ 200 million January 2001 bonds go at a weighted average of 7 . 098 percent , and the A $ 400 million of benchmark November 2006 bonds went at 7 . 603 percent . Bonds had already been softer through the morning after the U . S . market partially corrected its strong rally following the weaker than expected payrolls data on Friday . The Treasury Corporation of Victoria ( TCV ) announced a A $ 200 million tender for Wednesday . A new 7 . 50 percent August 2008 bond will be issued , following completion of the consolidation of the 12 . 50 percent July 2000 line into other TCV stocks . The key local event for the market is Thursday ' s employment data for September . Economists surveyed by Reuters expect employment to fall by 7 , 500 , and for the unemployment rate to come in at 8 . 6 percent . Such an outcome would be supportive of the market view that a November rate cut is likely , traders said . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( SPREADS ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - AUD VS 3 - YR 10 - YR * AUD 3 - YR / 10 - YR SPREAD USD 83 ( + 04 ) 109 ( + 06 ) * FUTURES 67 ( + 1 . 5 ) CAD 189 ( unch ) 84 ( + 06 ) * CASH 74 ( + 02 ) NZD - 102 ( + 02 ) - 39 ( - 03 ) * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Spreads to U .

Perry may leave Pentagon within months - sources . U . S . Defense Secretary William Perry has told President Bill Clinton that he wants to leave the Pentagon , perhaps within only a few months , U . S . defense officials said on Wednesday . One official , who asked not to be identified , said Perry told his staff early on Wednesday he had told Clinton after the President ' s re - election that he wanted to resign and return to private life after nearly four years on the job . The news that Perry , 69 , planned to leave followed statements by State Department officials that Secretary of State Warren Christopher planned to resign within days . Perry told his staff he had no definite date to leave but expected to stay on for at least a few months until Clinton appointed a successor . Perry took the job in 1994 after then Defence Secretary Les Aspin resigned under pressure . Despite questions over the continuing role of U . S . military peacekeepers in Bosnia and responsibility for two bomb blasts in Saudi Arabia that killed more than 20 U . S . troops , Perry is considered by many experts to be one of the strongest and most popular defence secretaries in decades . But he has also undertaken a crushing work and travel schedule . " I don ' t think there is any good time or bad time walking away from the job as secretary of defence , " Perry told reporters three weeks ago while returning from a trip to Europe . " There is always a problem . There is always a crisis . There ' s always some programme that is halfway completed . "

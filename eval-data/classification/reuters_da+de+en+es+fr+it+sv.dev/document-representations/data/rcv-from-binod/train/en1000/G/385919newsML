Scientology lashes out at Germany ' s Kinkel . The Church of Scientology lashed out at German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Tuesday for remarks he made after meeting U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and said he should put himself in the shoes of one of its members . Kinkel told a news conference on Monday that Scientologists were completely free in Germany . But the organisation said his remarks revealed " the hypocrisy of a man who has personally supported the exclusion of Scientologists from his party " . Heber Jentzsch , the Los Angeles - based president of Scientology , said members of Kinkel ' s Free Democrats ( FDP ) had to appeal to the party ' s highest internal tribunal to prevent themselves being excluded purely because of their religion . " Kinkel ' s simple denial of any discrimination is horrifying , " Jentzsch said . " I invite him to put his own words to the test . Kinkel should imagine for just one week that he is a Scientologist and he will find himself without any of the basic rights which German citizens otherwise enjoy , " he said . Germany does not accord Scientology the status of a religion , believing it to be purely a business which plays on the insecurities of its members to make big profits from costly " self - improvement " courses . Some regional states have taken further measures . Bavaria excludes companies run by Scientologists from bidding for public tenders and asking applicants for public sector jobs whether they belong to the group . The United States takes a different view . The State Department ' s annual human rights report , released last month , documented Scientologists ' allegations of discrimination in Germany over several pages . " It ' s Kinkel ' s lies which give diplomacy a bad name . Kinkel is concealing massive human rights violations behind the smiling face of diplomacy , " Jentzsch said . The Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Jentzsch ' s accusations , saying Kinkel had made his position on the organisation clear at Monday ' s news conference . U . S . officials said Kinkel and Albright discussed Scientology for about two minutes at the end of their one - hour meeting . Both ministers stressed that the subject was a minor one , which was not a burden on bilateral ties . Albright also described comparisons between Nazi persecution of the Jews and modern Germany ' s treatment of Scientologists - - an analogy often used by the church and its supporters - - as " historically inaccurate and distasteful " .

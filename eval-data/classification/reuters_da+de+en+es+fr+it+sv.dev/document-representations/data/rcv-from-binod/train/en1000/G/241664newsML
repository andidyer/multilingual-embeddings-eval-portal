Big turnout in landmark Ghana election . Ghanaians voted in large numbers in presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday , with President Jerry Rawlings facing a stiff opposition challenge in his bid for a final four - year term . Rawlings , a former air force flight - lieutenant who twice came to power through coups , has charisma but a key question in the election is whether his crowd - pulling abilities can bring him victory despite widespread unemployment and high inflation . Huge queues formed at polling stations in the West African nation ' s capital Accra long before they opened at or shortly after 7 a . m . ( 0700 GMT ) , following a lively but highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence . Security presence in the capital was discreet but troops were deployed ahead of the poll in the central city of Kumasi , heartland of the mighty pre - colonial Ashanti empire and stronghold of main opposition presidential hopeful John Kufuor . " It feels like there ' s going to be a change , " farmer Lawrence Boi , 72 , told Reuters at a polling station outside the 17th century Danish - built Christiansborg Castle , seat and symbol of presidential power in the gold - rich , former British colony . Boi , a veteran of all five of Ghana ' s elections since independence in 1957 , was waiting patiently with his 28 - year - old son at the end of a long queue in bright morning sunshine . " This man must go , " an opposition supporter aged 65 said , gesturing at the castle . Early polling was orderly and followed calls to vote early . Rawlings , 49 , who has dominated the life of Ghana since seizing power in 1979 , urged a high turnout in a controversial eve - of - poll nationwide address . He said the polls held " a very special significance in Ghana ' s democratic progress " noting that an administration was seeking re - election for the first time . The opposition , which paid the price of going into 1992 presidential and parliamentary polls in disarray , denounced the timing of Rawlings ' s broadcast address as unfair . Rawlings ' s rivals are Kufuor , 57 , of the New Patriotic Party and surgeon Edward Mahama of the People ' s National Convention . His National Democratic Congress faces strong competition for parliament ' s 200 seats from an alliance of Kufuor ' s party and the People ' s Convention Party , who have targeted inflation ( 39 . 2 percent in August ) and unemployment ( around 35 percent ) . More than nine million of Ghana ' s 17 . 5 million people are eligible to vote . At least one person died in political unrest in Kumasi during campaigning . At least 10 people died nearby when a truck careered into an opposition march . Ghana takes its name from an ancient empire that lasted from before Jesus Christ to the 12th century . Like the Ashanti empire of the late 18th and 19th centuries it based its power on gold . Nationalist leader Kwame Nkrumah , a figurehead among African independence leaders , was prime minister and then president of the new nation until the army deposed him in 1966 . Rawlings took power in 1979 , restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981 . Since then , the one - time socialist firebrand has steered Ghana down the road of Western - style economic liberalisation . About 100 foreign and 4 , 000 trained domestic observers monitored the polls , which close at 5 p . m . ( 1700 GMT ) . Early returns were expected on Sunday and full results on Monday . A run - off will be held in 21 days if no clear winner emerges . Whoever wins the presidency will have his running mate as automatic vice - president . Rawlings has law professor John Mills on his ticket . Kufuor has Rawlings ' s estranged vice - president Kow Arkaah . Outsider Mahamat chose a woman , Dedo Mate .

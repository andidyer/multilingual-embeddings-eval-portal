Great Western may seek merger to avoid takeover . Great Western Financial Corp . has apparently contacted at least one financial institution in an effort to fend off a hostile $ 6 . 3 billion takeover by the largest U . S . savings and loan , H . F . Ahmanson & Co . , a source close to the situation said Wednesday . According to the source , an investment banker working for Great Western was scheduled to meet with Seattle - based Washington Mutual Inc . . While it was not immediately clear if Washington Mutual would make a rival bid for Great Western , several industry analysts , including David Berry of Keefe Bruyette Woods believe Washington Mutual is a prime candidate . " They ' ve ( Washington Mutual ) been explicit about their desire to expand in California , " he said . " But it ' s uncertain if it can match Ahmanson . " Both Ahmanson and Great Western are based in Los Angeles . A merger of the two , whose operations overlap , would allow Ahmanson to close about 200 branches and realise savings of about $ 400 million . " It ' s the ultimate hand - in - glove merger due to the dramatic overlap , cost savings and synergies , " said Charlotte Chamberlain , an analyst with Jefferies and Co . But while few suitors could provide the cost savings Ahmanson can offer , analysts said Great Western is an attractive property in a quickly consolidating California market . " We ' ve not seen the end of the bidding by any stretch of the imagination , " said Jeff Naschek of Salomon Brothers , who believes Washington Mutual could bid about $ 50 a share for Great Western . " I think Washington Mutual could bid that high and still show earnings accretion , " Naschek said , adding , " for that matter , I think Ahmanson still has room to go on its bid . " Seattle - based Washington Mutual , which recently acquired Keystone Holdings Inc . and a Keystone unit , American Savings Bank , declined to comment . Great Western also declined to comment . On Monday night , Ahmanson offered to swap 1 . 05 of itsshares for each Great Western share , valuing Great Western at about $ 45 . 28 a share based on Wednesday ' s closing price . Washington Mutual ' s stock rose $ 2 to $ 58 . 25 a share on Nasdaq . Great Western stock rose 12 . 5 cents to $ 45 and Ahmanson ' s fell $ 1 . 75 to $ 43 . 125 , both in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . " The stocks are trading in a way that is suggesting a third party might emerge , " said one takeover specialist . Industry analysts said Great Western is likely to contact a number of banks and thrifts about a possible combination before responding formally to Ahmanson ' s offer . Ahmanson Chief Executive Officer Charles Rinehart said Tuesday he believed Ahmanson ' s offer was compelling as it stands , but did not rule out raising the bid . Great Western Wednesday reiterated it was reviewing Ahmanson ' s offer . Another potential bidder is Minneapolis - based First Bank System Inc . , which lost a bitter battle against Wells Fargo and Co . for First Interstate Bancorp . First Bank System declined to comment as did other potential suitors Norwest Corp . and NationsBank Corp .

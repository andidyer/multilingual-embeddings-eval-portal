Ortega refuses to concede Nicaragua election . Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega refused to concede defeat on Monday after early official results went against him in Nicaragua ' s presidential election , saying his party ' s unofficial count put him ahead . Official results with 6 . 96 percent of the votes counted gave right - wing lawyer Arnoldo Aleman a margin of almost ten percentage points over Ortega , prompting Aleman to claim he had won and launch into a victory speech at his headquarters . But Ortega , speaking calmly at the Sandinista campaign headquarters early on Monday , said Aleman ' s Liberal Alliance " has gone out to claim victory with a lot of haste when there are no elements to declare that the process has finished " . Ortega said the Sandinistas ' own unofficial count of the votes gave him a small margin over Aleman . " We have a parallel count done with depth where now at this time we have 300 , 000 votes counted . The Sandinista Front appears one ( percentage ) point ahead , " he said . Ortega also said the Sandinistas had detected " some anomalies " in the election process but declined to elaborate .

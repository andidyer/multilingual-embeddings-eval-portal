Ban computer games in federal offices - U . S . Senator . A Republican senator Wednesday proposed banning computer games in federal government offices and requiring a person , rather than a machine , to answer the telephone . Sen . Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina said he introduced a bill called the " Responsive Government Act " because of suggestions from constituents " frustrated with the federal government not always being responsive . " The bill would require a person rather than an automated system to answer the main telephone number at service - oriented federal offices until at least 5 p . m . EDT . Faircloth proposed the computer game ban after his staff took the senator on a tour of his Web site and he saw how easy it was to switch from games to work areas on the computer , a spokesman said . " So that was the end of the games in our office , " Peter Hans , the senator ' s spokesman , joked . " We were showing him the games that were on there and he said ' there ' s no reason that should be on any government computer ' , " Hans said , adding the games have been removed from the office computers . Faircloth said the computer game ban " could save the taxpayers millions of dollars recovered from lost productivity . " The bill would also require federal agencies to publish main telephone numbers in local directories , locate service offices in areas with sufficient parking , and include a telephone number of the author on all official correspondence .

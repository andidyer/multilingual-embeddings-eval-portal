FOCUS - Reuters plans 200 mln pound buyback . Global news and information group Reuters said on Wednesday it planned to repurchase shares worth up to 200 million pounds ( $ 335 . 8 million ) as the strong pound reduced first half profits by three percent . Pre - tax profit in the six months to end - June fell to 333 million pounds from 342 million a year ago , the company said . However , profits were 12 percent higher when measured at comparable exchange rates . Chief executive Peter Job said underlying revenue growth was in line with 1996 at eight percent and was expected to remain around this level for 1997 as a whole . The interim dividend was raised by 13 percent to 3 . 1 pence . Reuters said it expected to maintain double digit dividend growth in 1997 . The profit figure was towards the bottom end of analysts ' forecasts and Reuters shares fell 14 . 5p to 595p by 1100 GMT , giving up earlier gains . Analysts and dealers said the results had not provided enough of a positive surprise to allow the stock to build on its recent rally . It has lately rebounded from a year low of 555p set on July 10 . " The numbers are all right but the fact that they ( profits ) are down and they are only distributing 200 million ( stg ) has disappointed the market , " said NatWest analyst Neill Junor . Job said the recent UK budget resulted in a more level playing field for shareholders in relation to share buybacks , although advance corporation tax ( ACT ) remained a major constraint . He said the company would carry out a share repurchase programme " to return up to 200 million , which is possible within our ACT constraints . We continue to review developments in this area in relation to a more substantial return of cash . " The company was forced last October to scrap plans to return 613 million pounds to shareholders after the previous government changed the tax rules . Reuters said the return of 200 million pounds over the next 12 months would offset the growth in cash balances . Net funds increased by 71 million pounds to 1 . 12 billion in the first half . Revenue fell by 29 million pounds to 1 . 41 billion but rose by eight percent at comparable exchange rates . Reuters said underlying margins were maintained despite the cost of rolling out the new 3000 product range . The company said it did not expect the strong pound to impact its marketing positioning adversely , but currency factors were likely to continue to restrict reported revenue and earnings . Reuters said information products grew revenue by seven percent year on year at comparable exchange rates and improved market share . Installations of the 3000 series , slow to begin with , picked up strongly . Orders now total 24 , 300 , of which 10 , 600 have been installed . Transaction products revenue grew by 10 percent at comparable rates , with revenue at Instinet , the electronic equity brokerage , ahead by 17 percent . Revenue from the Dealing 2000 foreign exchange products rose by four percent at comparable rates . ( $ = 0 . 595 British Pounds )

Egypt says to start selling large state firms . Egypt will sell shares worth 1 . 5 billion pounds ( $ 440 million ) in three state conglomerates , Information Minister Safwat el - Sherif said in remarks published in Egyptian newspapers on Monday . He said 20 percent of each of Egypt Aluminium Products / Alumisr , Sugar and Integrated Industries ( SII ) and Egyptian Iron and Steel would be sold through the stock exchange . He gave no dates or prices . The total value of each company ' s tranche shows they will be at about 88 , 75 and 6 . 4 pounds respectively , figures in the newspapers said . The government will also offer the whole equity of Upper Egypt Contracting for sale at a price of 35 pounds per share . " It reflects the government ' s persistence to continue the privatisation programme , " Mohammed Abdullah , Intercapital managing director , told Reuters . " The aluminium and sugar industries in particular are strategic , " Abdullah said . He said the sales would reactivate the stock market . The Cairo exchange lost its lustre recently after several months in the limelight and prices are falling in less than average volumes . The government has repeatedly said that strategic industries would not be offered for sale . But firms in the milling sector , which is regarded by the government as strategic , were partially privatised and three of them are now mostly private . Egyptian Iron and Steel will be restructured before its shares are offered for sale , Sherif was quoted as saying . The company has more than 2 billion pounds of debt and has accumulated unsold stock , an official at the Holding Company for Metallurgical Industries told Reuters earlier this year . The privatisation ministerial committee also approved the evaluation of Nile Hilton hotel at 281 . 7 million pounds , Sherif said . $ 1 = 3 . 395 pounds - - Esmat Salaheddin + 2 02 578 3290 / 1

Enterprise Oil profits up , announces alliance . Britain ' s Enterprise Oil Plc reported a 59 percent surge in first - half profits on Thursday and announced an oil exploration alliance with Pennzoil Co . in the Gulf of Mexico . The company said profit after taxes jumped to 73 . 8 million pounds ( $ 114 . 8 million ) from 46 . 5 million ( $ 72 . 3 million ) a year earlier , boosted by higher oil prices and record production . Enterprise said an important factor in the results was higher oil prices , but added although prices are presently even higher , it remains cautious on the outlook . " We haven ' t rebased our whole thinking on $ 22 ( per barrel ) oil , " Enterprise finance director Andrew Shilston said . " In common with others , we think next year it will head back to a $ 15 - $ 18 range , " he said . Oil prices are around post - Gulf War highs at present , partly as a result of tension between the United States and Iraq , and Shilston acknowledged that this makes the outlook for oil prices even harder to judge than usual . At the same time , the company said it would pay a minimum of $ 100 million to Pennzoil to contribute to exploration costs in a deal covering 102 Pennzoil leases in the Gulf of Mexico . Enterprise international exploration director Andrew Armour said the deal was " a classic win - win , " benefiting both companies . He said the move , under negotiation since February , meant a rebalancing of Enterprise Oil ' s exploration portfolio and increasing its presence in the Gulf , where good prospects and extensive infrastructure offer potentially quicker returns than more frontier - type areas . " They ( Pennzoil ) recognise that we have a lot to bring , including money , " Armour said , adding that Pennzoil was seen as looking to expand internationally and focusing on development in the Gulf , rather than exploration .

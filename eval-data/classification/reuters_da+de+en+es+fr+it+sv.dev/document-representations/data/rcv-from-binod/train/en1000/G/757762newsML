Demi Moore , Bruce Willis sue over " divorce " story . Hollywood supercouple Bruce Willis and Demi Moore sued the Star tabloid for libel on Thursday over a story that claimed their marriage was failing . Their suit also accuses the Star of libelling Moore in a separate story that said she " partied up a storm " with actor Johnny Depp . Willis and Moore are seeking $ 5 million in general damages and unspecified punitive damages . There was no immediate comment from the tabloid , which the couple ' s lawyers said knew the articles to be false . According to the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court , a Star article on June 10 was headlined : " Bruce & Demi : On the Rocks - - Now it ' s Turning into Hollywood ' s Nastiest Divorce in Years . " The story said the celebrity couple , married for more than six years , were " secretly headed for splitsville . " A July 1 article headlined " Johnny Depp ' s Wild Night With Demi " said the actor partied with Moore after his split from model Kate Moss . The lawsuit said the Star articles depicted Willis and Moore as " estranged , flirtatious , unfaithful to one another , manipulative and irrational both personally and professionally . "

Greece says EU expansion threatened by Cyprus move . Greece said on Tuesday European Union enlargement would be threatened unless the EU dropped moves to bring the Turkish north of Cyprus into talks on admitting the island . But Dutch European Affairs Minister Michiel Patijn said Cypriot accession to the 15 - nation bloc would be politically and almost physically impossible without at least some progress between the island ' s Greek and Turkish communities . " We all realise that , unless progress is made between the communities , accession is politically and almost physically impossible , " Patijn told a news conference after EU and Cypriot foreign ministers met for an annual association council . The standoff between other EU states and Greece - - angry at what it calls a departure from an agreement that Cyprus ' s membership be limited to its southern Greek sector - - pushed entry talks on the divided island off the agenda of the meeting . Patijn said that , with elections looming in Cyprus in 1998 , this year provided " a window of opportunity " to influence a solution . Although EU foreign ministers went ahead with their annual meeting with Cyprus to review current relations , the most crucial issue of the future was taboo for want of a joint EU position . " The path to EU enlargement to the east will become very difficult if the agreement concerning Cyprus ' s accession changes , " Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said in Athens . Tension over the island between Turkey and Greece has mounted in recent months . Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos described the EU ' s new position , spearheaded by Britain and Germany , as " hostile and deceitful " and said Greece would " not accept any lords " within the EU . The EU ' s External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek , who visits Cyprus from Wednesday to meet both communities , said Greece ' s EU partners had not radically shifted position . The new approach , he told the news conference , was to " optimise the atmosphere under which these negotiations can start . " " The Greek side felt that this could be seen as a change of position . It was not intended to be , " he told Reuters earlier . The EU has vowed to open talks on Cypriot membership at the latest six months after the close of its current inter - governmental review of its workings to prepare the bloc for the day it has up to 25 members . In 1995 , after failing to find a political solution for the island , the EU agreed that Cypriot membership could be limited to its southern Greek part . Turkey invaded the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 , in response to a brief Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia that was backed by Athens . The international community , with the exception of Turkey , recognises the Greek Cypriot administration as the island ' s only government . To complicate matters further , Turkey - - whose own request for EU membership has been shunned on human rights grounds - - is threatening to bloc expansion of the NATO military alliance to eastern Europe if the EU continues to keep it at arm ' s length . Turkey and Greece , both NATO members , came close to war over an uninhabited islet in the Aegean Sea last year and Greece has approved a $ 12 billion arms programme for the next four years , saying it will not negotiate its territory .

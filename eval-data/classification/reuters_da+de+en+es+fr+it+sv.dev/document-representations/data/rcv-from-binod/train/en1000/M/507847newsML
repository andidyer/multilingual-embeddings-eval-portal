ING BARINGS - As the AEX ended its recovery at the upper side of its trading range last week , the chart has confirmed overhead resistance at 740 . Friday ' s fall below first support at 730 marks the start of another dip . The AEX is now poised to retrace some of its recent gains , but the charts show strong support 695 and 705 . Rising momentum indicates a base formation being deveoped above 700 . For short term market players current technicals suggest that it could be interesting to buy the dips . Money flow indicators remain mildly bullish , indicating some light buying power . But , as there is an overall lack of volume , these thin market conditions warn us not to be too optimistic . The A / D ratio remains flat , showing there is no leadership in the market . All in all we stick to our neutral rating as long as current congestion pattern on the charts between 700 - 740 remains intact . A break above 740 will not trigger a buying signal unless it has been accompanied by heavy volume . A close below 695 would delay positive scope . JAAD - The computer program has lowered its support level due to big increases in volatility and remains in a neutral position because some indicators are positive and some negative . MEESPIERSON - The technical indicators are still short term to medium term negative . We expect the range 700 - 740 as mentioned last week to continue until Friday expiration . The clue may come from wall Street this week . The market stays capped in a trading range between roughly 698 and 742 . We still think tha risks are on the downside were the market could reach the level of 680 to 660 . Therefore we first need to see a break from the support by 698 . The long term uptrend is still intact . ABN AMRO - Amsterdam has tested the 740 resistance level for the second time this week , and again this level proved to be the top for investors who are focusing on the short term time frame . After this test , prices dropped again in order to place a renewed attack on the diagonal support line which is being formed by the upperside of the long term upward sloping trendchannel . At the moment this line coincides with the 710 level . At the same time , the break out from the short term downtrend is being tested . A broad range of individual stocks are showing a comparable outlook , which supports our view . Additionally , related interest rate futures and important currencies are still supporting the upward scenario . In short , the upward potential is still present at current levels . Consequently , out short term indicators are bottoming out as higher prices are being set . We advise aggressive traders to go long at present levels , while maintaining an exit - stop at 708 level . The potential for this trade reaches till the 726 level in the first place . Above this intermediate resistance level 744 comes in sight , above which medium term investors are also advised to increase long positions . RABO SECURITIES - Tha trading range ( 700 - 745 ) is still intact and we expect the AEX to trade within these boundaries . Furthermore we expect the market to remain volatile over the next few weeks and only a clear break out of the trading range will signal a clear technical picture . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000

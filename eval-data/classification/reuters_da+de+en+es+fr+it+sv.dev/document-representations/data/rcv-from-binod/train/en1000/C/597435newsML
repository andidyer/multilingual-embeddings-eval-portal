These latest developments had sparked speculation that the talks would be far more complicated than expected , Business Day quoted its sources as saying . Gencor was not immediately available for comment . Analysts said on Monday they believed the possible JCI and Lonrho merger was initiated by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd , which was forced last month by the European Commission to cut its 27 . 5 percent stake in Lonrho to 9 . 99 percent over the next two years . The Commission said Anglo platinum interests combined with that of Lonrho would put control of the world ' s platinum industry in the hands of Anglo and Gencor . - - Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

PolyGram U . S . movie unit forms distribution branch . PolyGram NV ' s U . S . - based movie unit , PolyGram Filmed Entertainment , launched a major film distribution wing Friday as part of a long - term strategy to compete with the major domestic film studios . A small player in Hollywood compared with the likes of Time Warner Inc . ' s Warner Bros . studios and the Walt Disney Co . , London - based Polygram nevertheless has built a solid base of operations since opening shop here in January 1992 . It has film production agreements with Academy Award winner Jodie Foster and owns several independing production companies . It owns independent distributor Gramercy Pictures and operates home video and television divisions . By adding the major film distribution wing , called PolyGram Films , the company takes one more step toward becoming a full - fledged studio in its own right . " America is a shop window to the world ( for movies ) , and I ' m fed up with having my shop window arranged by some other arranger , " Michael Kuhn , president of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment , said in an interview . Plans call for the company to distribute 10 to 12 films a year with an even mix between major and small films . Kuhn defined a major motion picture from PolyGram as costing $ 40 million to $ 75 million and playing in some 1 , 500 theatres initially . PolyGram will handle five films in its first year , including " The Game , " a thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn , and Robert Altman ' s " The Gingerbread Man " . Previously , its major motion pictures had been distributed by one of the other major studios . Retaining the rights gives it a greater stake in box office receipts and more control over the product . Typically , a film ' s producer and distributor receive 40 to 50 percent of a movie ' s gross ticket sales with the remaining revenue going to theatre owners . The distributor and producer then split their percentage on some agreed upon formula , and generally the distributor gets the lion ' s share . Beyond box office , however , are the rights for home video sales , television broadcasts and emerging markets in satellite distribution and digital TV and new digital video disks . " That ' s what drives worldwide values for your movies , " Kuhn said . " When we ' ve been in charge , we ' ve done pretty well with movies like ' Usual Suspects ' , ' Dead Man Walking , ' Four Weddings and a Funeral ' and ' Fargo ' . " Indeed , of a film ' s total revenue stream , only about 20 percent comes from movie theatre sales , 50 percent from video and the remainder from TV and other mediums . As a result , large catalogues of films have become increasingly important to entertainment companies , and Polygram ' s library is a relatively small 400 titles . " The most frustrating thing is not having a big catalogue , " Kuhn said . In the past year , PolyGram has failed twice in attempts to boost its library . In 1996 it was outbid for Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc . and its 1 , 500 films . And earlier this year , it was trying to acquire Metromedia International Group ' s entertainment division , which included a 2 , 200 - film library . Both the companies were snapped up by the team of billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian and Australian media conglomerate Seven Network Ltd . - - MGM for $ 1 . 3 billion and the Metromedia group for $ 573 million . Kuhn said PolyGram is still in the market to acquire companies with large catalogues of entertainment products . Overseas PolyGram distributes about 75 percent of its own films . PolyGram is 75 - percent owned by Dutch electronics giant Philips Electronics NV .

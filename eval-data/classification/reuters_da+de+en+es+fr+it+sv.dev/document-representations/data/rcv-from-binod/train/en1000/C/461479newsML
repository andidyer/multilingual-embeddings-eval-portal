BC - LYONNAISE , SUEZ PREPARING MERGER PLAN - PRESS . French utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux and holding company Cie de Suez are working to conclude a merger proposal they hope to put to a Suez board meeting on April 1 , the newspaper Le Monde reported in its weekend edition . " Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet and Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod want to make rapid progress on the matter , " the newspaper said , citing anonymous sources . Suez already holds 16 percent of Lyonnaise . Le Monde said the two chairmen were expected to work on the plan this weekend along with Jean - Louis Beffa , chairman of glassmaker Saint - Gobain , which holds six percent of Suez ' s capital and 10 percent of the voting rights . Lyonnaise and Suez officials were not available for comment . Financial weekly Investir on Friday reported that Compagnie Generale des Eaux ( CGE ) was considering a hostile bid for Suez to block a merger between Suez and its rival Lyonnaise . But a source close to the group said on Friday that CGE ' s strategy was not an acquisition of Suez . The newspaper Le Figaro , noting that Suez ' s market capitalisation was 45 billion francs , said CGE was unlikely to launch a hostile takeover bid as it has 48 billion francs of debt and 30 billion of equity . It said CGE was more likely to attempt a deal through a share exchange or to block a Lyonnaise - Suez merger by lining up Suez shareholders to oppose it . Belgian businessman Albert Frere owns eight percent of Suez through holding company Electrafina , AXA - UAP has close to eight percent , Credit Agricole has seven percent , Saint - Gobain six percent and BNP 5 . 5 percent . CGE owns 20 percent of Electrafina , and recently agreed to take 30 percent of media group Havas , in which Frere holds five percent . Le Monde said Frere had not announced which camp he would back in the fight over Suez . - - Paris Newsroom , + 33 1 4221 5452 REUTER 221548 GMT mar 97

Zimbabwe inflation rises , seen in 16 - 18 pct range . Zimbabwe ' s annual inflation rose to 16 . 4 percent in December from a seven - year low of 13 . 9 percent in November , in line with forecasts by many local economic analysts . Although a recent spate of price increases , including the cost of fuel , are expected to feed January ' s inflation figure , many analysts still expect annual inflation to stay in a 16 - 18 percent range in the first quarter of 1997 . The December rate from the state Central Statistical Office ( CSO ) left the average monthly inflation rate for 1996 at 21 . 7 percent compared with 22 . 5 percent the previous year . It was also below the 20 percent forecast for the year - end in the country ' s 1996 / 97 budget . Savvas Kyriakides , managing director of economic and share market analysts Dataworld , said the monthly inflation rate would be kept in check by low food prices . Food accounts for 29 . 2 percent of Zimbabwe ' s inflation basket , the largest single weighting . " We are expecting a bumper harvest . . . and that should balance off other areas , " Kyriakides told Reuters . Zimbabwe ' s farm - based economy is expected to grow by seven percent this year , up from an estimated five percent in 1996 , on the back of a good agricultural season . John Robertson , one of the country ' s leading economic consultants , also said the December figure was widely expected , but maintaining it in a 16 - 18 percent range would depend on how President Robert Mugabe ' s government managed to control spending and money supply growth . " There is still a lot of work to be done in this area , " he said . Last November , Zimbabwe ' s central Reserve Bank raised to 20 percent from 17 . 5 percent the statutory reserves banks are required to keep with it . The central bank said the measure was aimed at tightening money supply growth - - which has remained stubbornly above a target of 22 percent per year fixed under economic reforms started in 1991 . That growth , many local analysts say , threatens efforts to keep inflation down . Wage increases later in the year may also fuel inflation . - - - Harare Newsroom : + 263 - 4 72 52 27 / 8 / 9 . - - -

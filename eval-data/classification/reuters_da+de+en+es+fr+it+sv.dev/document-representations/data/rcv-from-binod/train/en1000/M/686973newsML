Eurobonds see Aussie dollar global sector reopened . 1330 GMT - - The first Australian dollar global bond of the year was the highlight of a busy session in the primary market on Wednesday amid a swathe of retail - targeted paper . * * Fannie Mae asked for A $ 1 . 0 billion over five years at around 10 b . p . over the curve , in a well - received transaction . * * GMAC issued its expected $ 500 million five - year Euro - Asian bond at 40 b . p . over . * * The World Bank set a $ 250 million two - year bond priced four b . p . through U . S . T - notes . * * Austria ' s PSK launched a $ 250 million December 2000 bond and Abbey National added $ 100 million to a recent three - year . New issue business picked up sharply on Wednesday led by the reopening of the Australian dollar global bond sector . Fannie Mae asked for A $ 1 . 0 billion for five years at a spread of 19 . 5 basis points over the 9 . 75 percent government bond due March 2002 , which equated to around 10 b . p . over the curve , SBC Warburg said as bookrunner . A syndicate manager at SBC Warburg said the offering was oversubscribed but no allocations had been made yet . " It was launched late in the Asian session , so we missed Japan . But there was good demand from central banks in non - Japan Asia . " The deal will be priced on Thursday morning in Europe . Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Merrill Lynch International were also joint lead managers . Sources close to the deal said it was being treated as a surrogate Australian government bond , and one that might prove " It ' s pretty much a unique product , " said one dealer , who added that the deal , the first Australian dollar global from a non - Australian name since 1992 , should tighten over time . That would match the performance on the NZ $ 500 million five - year global launched by Fannie Mae on June 6 . Demand for today ' s funding , like the N . Z . dollar deal , was almost entirely institutional whereas international bonds in the two currencies are generally almost exclusively retail affairs , dealers said . Elsewhere , General Motors Acceptance Corp launched the $ 500 million five - year Euro - Asian bond it flagged on Tuesday . HSBC Markets and Paribas jointly led the deal which was reoffered 40 b . p . over U . S . Treasuries and quoted at a 40 39 b . p . spread during the afternoon on broker screens . HSBC said sales had been widespread throughout Asia and Europe , but with little demand from France or Japan . An HSBC syndicate manager said the bearer form of today ' s GMAC deal had drawn in retail investors deterred by the registered global bond GMAC launched earlier in the year . The World Bank set a $ 250 million two year bond priced four b . p . through U . S . Treasuries . " The bond is designed to appeal to retail investors who want to stay in dollar bonds and are more enthusiastic about the short end of the cuve , " a syndicate official at lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . " The response so far has been very good with demand from Switzerland , Germany , Benelux . " Abbey National added $ 100 million to a three - year bond , launched originally for $ 400 million on June 16 . " There has been ongoing strong demand for the issue and on the back of that we decided to increase it , " a syndicate official at joint lead manager SBC Warburg said . - - Dan Lalor , London newsroom + 44 171 542 8863

Taleban say capture two more towns from opposition . Afghanistan ' s Islamic Taleban militia captured the important towns of Jabal - os - Siraj and Gulbahar from opposition forces north of Kabul on Thursday , Taleban and other sources said . The sources , quoted by the Pakistan - based Islamic Afghan Press ( AIP ) service , said the Taleban had captured 20 tanks and at least 80 opposition soldiers in the fighting , in which six Taleban and 11 opposition fighters were killed . Both towns are strongholds of former government military commander Ahmad Shah Masood and their loss constitutes a major setback for the anti - Taleban alliance led by Masood and his former rival , northern Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostum . Jabal - os - Siraj , about 70 km ( 44 miles ) from Kabul , lies at the foot of the towering Salang Pass on the main road from the Afghan capital to Dostum ' s northern heartland . Gulbahar , about 15 km ( nine miles ) northeast of Jabal - os - Siraj , commands the entrance to the rugged Panjsher Valley , scene of many of Masood ' s guerrilla exploits against Soviet occupation troops in the 1980s . The Taleban achieved their latest advance a week after capturing the Soviet - built military airbase at Bagram and the nearby town of Charikar , about 50 km ( 31 miles ) north of Kabul .

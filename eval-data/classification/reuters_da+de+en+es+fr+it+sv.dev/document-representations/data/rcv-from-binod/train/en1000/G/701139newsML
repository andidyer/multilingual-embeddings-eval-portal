SOCCER - ESNAIDER IN SWAP DEAL WITH LARDIN OF ESPANYOL . Argentine international Juan Eduardo Esnaider on Wednesday signed a three - year contract , taking him from Atletico Madrid to fellow Spanish first division club Espanyol . An Espanyol official said Esnaider would form part of a swap deal , still to be concluded , which would take Espanyol striker Jordi Lardin to Atletico . Lardin ' s contract with Espanyol includes a ' withdrawal clause ' valuing the player at two billion pesetas ( $ 13 . 8 million ) . A similar clause puts a price of 500 million pesetas ( $ 3 . 45 million ) on Esnaider . Atletico are expected to pay about 1 . 5 billion pesetas ( $ 10 . 3 million ) and give Espanyol a further player , possibly midfielder Roberto Fresnedoso , in the deal . But Atletico said on Wednesday that they had still not signed Lardin . Esnaider played in Zaragoza ' s 1995 European Cup Winners ' Cup triumph while on loan from Real Madrid . But he failed to fulfil expectations after returning to Real and has suffered heavy criticism since moving across the Spanish capital to Atletico last year .

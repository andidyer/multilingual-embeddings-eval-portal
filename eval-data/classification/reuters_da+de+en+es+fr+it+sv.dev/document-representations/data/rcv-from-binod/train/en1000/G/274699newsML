Serbian socialist rally at opposition demo site . Serbian authorities staging a mass demonstration in support of President Slobodan Milosevic built a speaking platform on Tuesday at the central Belgrade site where an opposition protest was planned for the same time . The prospect of several hundred thousand political foes mingled together raised tensions after a warning from the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle that five weeks of political conflict in Serbia could turn into armed confrontation . The protests , each with their own speakers , were due to start at 1500 ( 1400 GMT ) outside the offices of the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition . which accused Milosivic of cheating it of victory in local elections on November 17 . Zajedno was told the socialists had mobilised 10 , 000 buses around Serbia to bring demonstrators including factory workers for " a spontaneous assembly of supporters of the peaceful and consistent policy of President Milosevic " . The opposition demonstration has consistently drawn 100 , 000 people to street marches and anti - Milosevic speeches at Zajedno headquarters . Although the opposition rallies in Belgrade and other towns have been peaceful , the news agency BETA reported scuffles between pro and anti - government demonstrators on Monday in Valjevo , 40 km ( 25 miles ) southwest of Belgrade . BETA said fist - fights erupted when around 20 , 000 Zajedno activists took to the streets in response to a socialist rally . " A large fist fight broke out between the citizens of Valjevo and these outsiders , in which SPS sympathizers fared very poorly , and six of the buses that had brought them to the rally . . . were demolished , " the Belgrade agency said . Orthodox Patriarch Pavle urged Zajedno to suspend its protest to avoid the risk of clashes and said both sides should resist confrontation , " especially members of the ruling parties behind whom stand the armed forces of the present order " . Zajedno feared police provocateurs would be planted in the protests to foment trouble and give riot police an excuse to intervene for the first time since the crisis began . But it refused to halt its own demonstration despite concerns that Milosevic might be looking for a pretext to declare a state of emergency . The last political street violence seen in Serbia was in 1991 when Milosevic use tanks to drive protesters off the streets and two lives were lost . There were no immediate reports that the Independent Farmers Union had carried out a threat to blockade Serbian roads which would have jeopardized the socialist plan to bring supporters by bus from the provinces . Scores of empty buses were brought to the capital overnight to avoid any blockade which would have prevented them carrying workers from suburban factories to the city centre . Union leaders staged a symbolic blockade of a road between the northern towns of Novi Sad and Zrenjanin on Monday . They said the action was non - political and in demand for money the government owes farmers . Workers have mostly ignored the intelligentsia - led marches . Opposition sources said factory hands were threatened with reprisals , including the withdrawal of lay - off pay , if they refused to attend the socialist rally .

Antibiotics not best for ear infections - journal . Antibiotics are not the best treatment for middle ear infections and doctors should stop routinely prescribing drugs for them , international experts said on Friday . Although middle ear infections can be distressing - - with a crying , inconsolable child clearly in pain - - antibiotics may only do harm , they said . Larry Culpepper of Boston University and a team of other doctors from the Netherlands , Britain and the United States said needlessly dosing children with drugs had helped antibiotic - resistant organisms to evolve . They examined studies on treating middle ear infections and concluded that the antibiotics were a waste of time for most children . " Placebo studies indicate that more than 80 percent of children with acute otitis media ( middle ear infection ) recover without antimicrobials , " they wrote in a paper for the British Medical Journal . " Existing research offers no compelling evidence that children with acute otitis media routinely given antimicrobials have a shorter durations of symptoms , fewer recurrences , or better long - term outcomes than those who do not receive them . " In fact , giving the drugs could be harmful , they said . " Antimicrobial use in children with otitis media results in the emergence of resistant organisms in those children and in the community , " they wrote . Tests showed children routinely given drugs such as ampicillin tested positive for strains of influenza - and pneumonia - causing microbes resistant to drug therapy . Despite this , ear infections were the most common reason antibiotics were prescribed to outpatients , and 97 percent of children with ear infections in Britain were prescribed drugs . Researchers said a better approach would be prevention . Tobacco smoke is a known aggravator of ear infections , and babies who are breast - fed are less prone to them . Encouraging hand - washing in day - care centres and elsewhere would also help prevent the spread of bugs that cause the infections , they added .

Open - end status for GT Global Dev proposed . Newgate Management said Tuesday it would propose to convert the publicly - traded GT Global Developing Markets Fund Inc to an open - ended fund to realize its hidden value at the fund ' s annual shareholders meeting . The fund , which is managed by GT Global Inc , has been trading at a ( 52 - week average ) 18 . 77 percent discount to its net asset value , said Kun Deng , a senior research analyst with Newgate , a private investment management firm . " The fund doesn ' t deserve to trade at such a huge discount , " Deng said . He added that while half the fund ' s assets are in emerging markets debt , other GT funds specializing in these investments typically trade at a five percent discount . If an closed - ended fund is converted to an open - ended fund , its shareholders can redeem their shares at the fund ' s net asset value , thereby pocketing the discount the fund may have been trading at . Deng said 45 percent of the fund ' s shareholders supported a similar proposal last year . " This time we ' re going to win the war , " he said , adding Newgate is the fund ' s largest shareholder , holding 2 . 5 million shares out of 30 million . While a GT Global Inc spokeswoman said no date had been set for the fund ' s shareholders meeting , Deng expected it to take place " sometime in late July . "

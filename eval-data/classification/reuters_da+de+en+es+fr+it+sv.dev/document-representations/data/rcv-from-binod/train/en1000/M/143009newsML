Oil prices bounce back from midweek selloff . Oil prices rebounded on Friday as the market returned to focus on bullish fundamentals and put a midweek selloff behind it . London December futures for international benchmark Brent crude ended the day ' s trading at $ 24 . 22 a barrel , 47 cents up on the day . On Wednesday and Thursday , Brent shed nearly $ 1 a barrel in value but rumours of unexpected refinery shutdowns in the United States were enough to draw out fresh buying . Confirmation of an unplanned shutdown of a unit at a refinery in Texas also helped lift prices a little on Friday . Oil prices hit post Gulf War highs last week largely on fears that historically low levels of heating fuel stocks in the United States and Europe would fall short of meeting peak winter demand . " The market is vulnerable to supply shortfalls more than ever , " a London trader said . But this upwards pressure on prices eased earlier this week on news of a big stock build in heating oil inventories in the U . S . Northeast , the world ' s largest heating oil consuming market . Warm weather on both sides of the Atlantic also helped take the shine off the prolonged rally which has added some $ 9 to the price of oil since mid - June . But traders said it was too early in the heating oil season to predict an end to the rally , traders said . " People are talking about 60 degree ( Fahrenheit ) weather but they are forgetting that we have not seen winter yet , " said Peter Gignoux , head of the London energy desk at Smith , Barney in London .

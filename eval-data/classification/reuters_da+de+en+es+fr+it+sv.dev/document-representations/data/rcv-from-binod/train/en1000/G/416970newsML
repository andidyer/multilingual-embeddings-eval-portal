CRICKET - KIWIS DRAW ONE - DAY SERIES VS ENGLAND . A resurgent New Zealand cricket team on Tuesday dashed England ' s hopes of a one - day series victory , bowling the tourists out for 200 after setting them 229 to win the fifth and decisive game . The win means the Kiwis salvage a 2 - 2 draw in the five - match one - day series after England won the first two games and the third was tied in Napier last Wednesday . " The team showed a lot of guts to come through what has been a difficult period , " New Zealand captain Lee Germon said after the game . " I think we ' ve come a long way to resurrecting the season . " Set 229 to win the match , England got away to a promising start . Paceman Geoff Allott clean bowled Mike Atherton with the third ball of the innings , but the England skipper was saved by a dubious no ball call from umpire Evan Watkin . Television replays clearly showed Allott ' s foot was not fully over the no - ball line . But England ' s good fortune was short - lived . Allott soon had the prized wicket of Alec Stewart , who smashed a full toss straight to mid - on when he was on 18 . Atherton made the most of his reprieve , stroking 43 runs in effortless fashion until some sharp fielding saw him run out by keeper Lee Germon . After Chris Harris enticed Nasser Hussain out of his crease to have him stumped by Germon for 20 , England ' s hopes rested with Graham Thorpe . The gritty left - hander came to the party , punishing anything loose to progress rapidly into the 30s . But persistent pressure form the New Zealand field saw wickets fall regularly at the other end . Spinner Dipak Patel bowled Chris Silverwood for 4 , Gavin Larsen had John Crawley lbw for 11 , and Jack Russell , making his first appearance in the one - day series here , nicked a Nathan Astle ball to be cuaght behind for just two . Craig White fell to Astle two balls later without scoring and when Robert Croft was run out for two , their chances of pulling off the win were remote . Thorpe ' s innings came to an end when he was stumped by Germon off Larsen for 55 . His half - century had come in 83 balls with two boundaries . Gough was the last man out , caught on the cover fence for 16 in the 47th over . England assistant coach John Emburey paid tribute to the New Zealand bowling attack , in which medium - pacers Larsen and Harris were again the most restrictive . " They really started to put the screws on and put the players under pressure . We made a few mistakes and started to get behind the clock , " Emburey said . New Zealand were able to post a defendable 228 after a dashing 94 from Astle . His sterling knock and two wickets earned him the man of the match award . England comprehensively beat the Kiwis 2 - 0 in the three test matches in February and cruised almost effortlessly to a 2 - 0 lead in the five - match one - day series . With their backs to the wall and mounting public frustration over the poor results , New Zealand revitalised their game . They tied the third match and won the last two in dramatic fashion to secure the 2 - 2 series draw and regain some lost pride . They now face Sri Lanka in the first of two tests starting in Dunedin on Friday .

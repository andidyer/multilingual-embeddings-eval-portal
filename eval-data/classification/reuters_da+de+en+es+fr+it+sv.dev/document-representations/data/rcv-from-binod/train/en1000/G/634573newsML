Sri Lanka laws boon for wildlife smugglers . Sri Lanka has become a popular transit point in global trafficking of endangered species because of the absence of laws to punish offenders , customs officials said on Tuesday . The incidence of smugglers using the Indian Ocean island to send rare animals to European destinations had increased sharply in past years , Customs Superintendent Samantha Gunasekera told Reuters . " Sri Lanka is the transit point for this type of cargo coming from the sub - continent and headed for Europe , " he said . " But our existing laws on transit goods prevent us from apprehending the goods or their traffickers . " Large numbers of exotic birds , butterflies , birds ' nests , live cocoons , jackal heads , animal skins and turtle shells pass through Sri Lanka daily , originating from countries such as India and Pakistan , according to officials . While Sri Lankan law does not allow for the seizure of endangered species which are in transit , it does provide for the confiscation of similar items brought in or taken out of the country without a proper permit . " There are many foreigners hanging around our forests for the purpose of collecting species of flora and fauna for export . We are constantly on the lookout for them , " Gunasekera said . In January , authorities fined a Danish national 6 , 000 rupees ( $ 103 ) after he tried to smuggle out 24 live tarantulas . This week , customs authorities confiscated four rare macaws which a local wildlife trader tried to bring into the country without a valid permit , Gunasekera said . The trader was fined and the birds were handed over to Colombo zoo .

State - owned banks may buy into Vietnam ' s VP Bank . Two state - owned Vietnamese banks are likely to buy up to 10 percent each of VP Bank ' s equity when the troubled private institution increases its capital in coming days , a senior VP Bank official said on Monday . " They ( the central bank ) have decided to support us , and maybe in the very near future the state - owned banks will become our shareholders , " said the official , speaking anonymously . He named the two state - owned banks as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam ( Incombank ) and the Vietnam Bank for Investment and Development . The official said that VP Bank , whose full name is the Vietnam Joint - Stock Commercial Bank for Private Enterprises , planned to increase its registered capital to 250 billion dong ( $ 21 . 46 million ) from 175 billion dong . He said VP Bank ' s two foreign shareholders , both investment funds with 10 percent each , would probably participate in the capital increase to keep their stakes at the same level . An official at the Dublin - listed Vietnam Fund declined to comment and officials at Dragon Capital , which is part of the Dublin - listed Vietnam Enterprise Investments Ltd , were not available to comment . However , banking sources said that state - owned banks were resisting pressure from the central State Bank of Vietnam to subscribe to VP Bank ' s capital increase . An official at the Bank for Development and Investment denied that there were plans for his bank to buy into VP Bank . VP Bank , which in 1995 became the first of Vietnam ' s private banks to have foreign shareholders , has been in the spotlight in recent weeks after failing to honour a $ 3 million - letter of credit . News of that default has sparked fears over a liquidity crunch in the banking system and the weight of short - term debt on banks ' books . One industry source said earlier this month that VP Bank was negotiating to extend the payment date on a clutch of letters of credit worth $ 19 million . In a bid to put the bank back on an even keel , the management has been shaken up and five joint - stock banks - - including VP Bank - - earlier this month set up a mutual cooperation fund to provide each other with emergency liquidity .

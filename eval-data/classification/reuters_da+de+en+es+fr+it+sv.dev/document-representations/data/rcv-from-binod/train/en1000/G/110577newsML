Obstacle to release of Colombian troops cleared . The Colombian government bowed to demands by leftist rebels on Friday to name a delegate to a commission that will witness the release of at least 60 soldiers held as prisoners of war since Aug . 30 . After weeks of procrastinating and publicly complaining that the rebels wanted to turn the release into a media circus , the government named Carlos Vicente de Roux , President Ernesto Samper ' s special adviser on human rights , as its chief delegate to the commission headed by the International Committee of the Red Cross . Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels seized the soldiers after overrunning a military base in southern Putumayo province at the start of a nationwide offensive in which scores of police and soliders were killed and hundreds wounded . Pedro Leon Calarca , the FARC ' s Mexico City - based spokesman , said in a telephone interview on Friday that he had no idea why the government had taken so long to name its delegate to the commission . But military commanders , publicly humiliated by the attack in Putumayo , have bridled at the idea of ceding to any demands by the FARC , saying only that international law required the immediate release of the prisoners . " The guerrillas no longer have any excuse to delay the return of the soldiers , " Samper said after the appointment of De Roux was announced . De Roux was slightly less optimistic , however , saying it could take another two weeks before the capitve soldiers were finally freed . " When human lives are in the balance you have to act with a lot of caution and a lot of serenity , " he told reporters .

Portugal Feb prices seen rising 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 pct - poll . Portuguese consumer price inflation is expected to rise between 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 percent in February , compared to an increase of 0 . 3 percent in January , according to a poll of six analysts . The National Statistics Institute is expected to release February inflation data at an undisclosed date from Friday onwards . A monthly increase in prices of 0 . 2 percent , 0 . 3 percent and 0 . 4 percent would give a year - on - year increase of 2 . 8 , 2 . 9 and 3 . 0 percent respectively and average annual inflation would stand at 3 . 2 percent . Most analysts agreed that February inflation in that range would keep the government on course to meet its target for average inflation of between 2 . 25 and 2 . 5 percent in 1997 . But analysts were divided over whether the index relating to non - tradable goods would fall significantly in February . Non - tradeable goods are those which do not face foreign competition and changes in their prices are a key component in the Bank of Portugal ' s decision on whether to alter key rates . Non - tradeable goods prices rose by 0 . 1 percent over a three month period to 5 . 1 percent in January . In January 1997 , monthly inflation was 0 . 3 percent , year - on - year inflation was 3 . 3 percent and average annual inflation was 3 . 2 percent . In February 1996 , monthly inflation rose by 0 . 6 percent , year - on - year inflation by 2 . 5 percent and average annual inflation by 3 . 8 percent . " I see an increase of 0 . 4 percent for inflation in February , but I still believe that disinflation will continue this year and will come within the government ' s target range by the end of 1997 , " said Luis Santos , analyst of BTA . Maria Amelia Valverde , analyst of ESR - Espirito Santo Research , said : " In the next quarter , consumer price inflation numbers will be better due to the effect of the ' Mad Cow ' effect , which pushed up prices a year ago . " " The fall in the average inflation rate will be evident from the second quarter of 1997 , but the fall of the year - on - year rate will be seen from next month , " said Isabel Costa of Banco Finantia . Analysts said that February prices would feel some impact from an increase in water charges , but this would be counter - balanced by a slowdown in prices of food , eating out and transport .

Belarus leader snubs Russian peace talks . Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko snubbed peace talks with his opponents organised by Moscow on Wednesday and refused to scrap a referendum on extending his powers . Lukashenko spoke for 40 minutes to President Boris Yeltsin , still recovering in hospital after a heart operation two weeks ago , but remained adamant that the referendum would go ahead on Sunday . " I will not give up the referendum . Thousands of people have already cast their votes . We will carry it to the end , " he told electoral officials in Minsk . The talks in Smolensk , a Russian city halfway between Minsk and Moscow , went ahead without Lukashenko . His main opponent , parliament chairman Semyon Sharetsky , met Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev , the leaders of Russia ' s two houses of parliament . Lukashenko ' s aides said he stayed away - - a slap in the face for Russia ' s mediation efforts - - because he was " very busy " . " The president has decided not to go to Smolensk . He has an extremely tight schedule and so he has decided not to go , " Mikhail Podgainy , head of information at the presidential administration , told Reuters . Lukashenko ' s closest aide , Vladimir Zametalin , said the president would not be going because Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , expected to attend , would not be there . However it was Chernomyrdin himself who first suggested the talks in a telephone conversation with Lukashenko on Tuesday . Aides said Lukashenko would spend Thursday campaigning in the Western city of Brest on the border with Poland , and might meet Chernomyrdin on Friday or Saturday . But Chernomyrdin ' s office said he would be spending Friday in Murmansk . The Belarus constitutional court , which like parliament has been at odds with Lukashenko for months , said it would start hearing parliament ' s impeachment case against him on Friday . Impeachment is unlikely however . A two - thirds majority in parliament would be needed to remove Lukashenko , who relies on support from a substantial minority of deputies . Sharetsky , before travelling to Smolensk , said parliament wanted Lukashenko to cancel the referendum , withdraw his proposed changes to the constitution and a series of illegal decrees , reinstate the sacked head of the Central Electoral Commission and give deputies television time . In return parliament would drop the impeachment moves . Sharetsky ' s press spokesman told Reuters that Yeltsin , who also spoke to him by telephone , had backed this " Zero Option " solution , but this could not be confirmed . Russia ' s Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin ' s foreign affairs adviser Dmitry Ryurikov as saying political instability in Belarus would decline if the country could be integrated more closely with Russia . Lukashenko , recounting his own talk with the convalescent Russian president , said Yeltsin " admitted he was not sufficiently informed about the real situation in the republic . " Interfax quoted Lukashenko as telling his parliamentary supporters the next step was up to his opponents and he would not back down until they withdrew the attempt to impeach him . Lukashenko ' s campaign for the referendum , in which early voting began on November 9 , continued apace as the two sides spoke . Loudspeakers were heard in central Minsk , blasting out appeals to the population to vote and support Lukashenko . A defiant Lukashenko told his critics at a rally on Monday that he would not give up power to " adventurers " and they should prepare to " find another motherland " after the referendum . Lukashenko , who controls the security forces and most of the media and who enjoys considerable support among the mostly rural population of 10 million , has vowed to override any opposition . The presidents of neighbouring Lithuania , Ukraine and Poland issued a joint declaration on Wednesday expressing deep concern over the conflict in Belarus and calling for a constitutional solution and respect for human rights . The statement was signed by Poland ' s Aleksander Kwasniewski , Lithuania ' s Algirdas Brazauskas and Ukraine ' s Leonid Kuchma . The 42 - year - old leader has scorned criticism from his neighbours and from the West but is heavily dependent on Russian economic support . He and Yeltsin agreed in April to unite their countries in a " community " . Lukashenko is seeking authority to extend his term by more than two years and widen his powers over all institutions .

Zaire rebels say talks imminent . Zaire ' s rebels said on Thursday that negotiations with representatives of ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko and the central authorities in Kinshasa could take place in a few days . Bizima Karaha , rebel leader Laurent Kabila ' s foreign affairs strategist , told a news conference on the sidelines of an Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit in Togo , that South Africa or Togo were likely venues . " We are very excited to learn that for the first time the people ( authorities ) of Kinshasa have decided to agree to a starting of the negotiations which are going to be in a very few days to come , " he said . " We are ready to go in any country as long as these Zaireans are serious , " he said , as mentioning Togo and South Africa by name . He said the rebels , who were attending their first major international forum , were ready to sign a ceasefire , but the question was " with whom " . Karaha said that Kabila , whose forces are fighting to topple Mobutu and who control one fifth of the sprawling Central African nation , would not negotiate in person as the rebels had a special team to do that . The rebel representatives in Togo said that Mobutu , who returned home last Friday after fresh cancer treatment in Europe , was the only real power left in Kinshasa and that negotiations should be with him or his representatives . " It ' s in his interests to negotiate his own departure , " Gaeten Kakudji , the second Kabila representative , said . Kakudji and Karaha said they shook hands with the representatives of the central authorities late on Wednesday in the presence of host President Gnassingbe Eyadema and U . N . Secretary - General Kofi Annan , in what Togo described as a symbolic first step towards reconciliation . " It ' s a very important stage which has been crossed . Here you have foes who were not speaking to one another who shook hands , " Togo ' s Foreign Minister Pierre Koffi Panou told French radio earlier . The OAU called the special summit to try to broker peace in the crisis at the heart of Africa . The heads of state brought the two sides together in the same room on Wednesday during a closed session of their summit and allowed each to have their say . Throughout the meeting , the rebel team has insisted it is not in Togo to negotiate . France and the United States , among Western nations who have sent troops to the region to evacuate their nationals if peace efforts collapse and violence erupts in Kinshasa , have been jointly lobbying for a truce and talks . Diplomatic pressure focused on a five point peace plan formulated by U . N . special envoy Mohamed Shanoun , who was also attending the summit . Heads of state and other would - be mediators all urged the rebels to embrace the plan , which has already been accepted by the government in Kinshasa . In Kinshasa itself , political confusion reigned after he resignation of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo ' s government . Kengo remains in charge in a caretaker capacity . The central authorities in Kinshasa are represented by Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda and the deputy speaker of the transitional assembly , Andre Boboliko .

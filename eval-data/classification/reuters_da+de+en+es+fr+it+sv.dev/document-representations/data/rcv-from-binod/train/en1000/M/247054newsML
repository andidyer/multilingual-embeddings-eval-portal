IPE Brent tumbles in NYMEX - led technical fall . IPE Brent crude futures hit a new low in mid - afternoon trade in a NYMEX - led fall , brokers said . " It was really products led , then ( NYMEX crude ) broke through $ 25 , and started hitting the ( technical selling ) stops , " said a broker . At 1607 GMT , Jan Brent was trading at a session low of $ 23 . 62 a barrel , 48 cents down on the day , having breezed through support at $ 23 . 77 . Gas oil retraced gains and moved into the red to trade $ 1 . 50 a tonne lower at $ 214 . The release of European Union stock data showing a heavy build in distillate stocks helped to push gas oil off highs , brokers said . Middle distillate stocks in the European Union , excluding Sweden , rose by 2 . 55 million barrels or 0 . 9 percent in November to 295 . 73 million barrels , the Euroilstock foundation said on Tuesday . Distillate stocks were 770 , 000 barrels higher than at the end of November 1995 , wiping out the year - on - year shortfall that has persisted for most of the year , helping to underpin price levels . Brokers said that signs of delays to Iraqi crude exports failed to lend support to the crude market . " We ' re not too bothered if ( Iraqi crude ) comes out tomorrow rather than today , " said one dealer . " We ' d only jump if it wasn ' t coming at all . " A Turkish oil official said no Iraqi oil had arrived at a Turkish terminal on Tuesday , hours after Iraq said it had begun pumping crude exports from its northern city of Kirkuk . - - Rosalind Russell , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5387

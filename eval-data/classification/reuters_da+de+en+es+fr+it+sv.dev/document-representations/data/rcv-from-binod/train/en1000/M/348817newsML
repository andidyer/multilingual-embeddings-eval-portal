Japan investors shun domestic for U . S . stocks - poll . Japanese institutional investors say more of their money will be flowing into the U . S . stock market in February as uncertainty continues to surround shares at home , according to a Reuters survey released on Friday . The investment survey showed that for the the fifth month in a row , the equities weighting for the domestic market fell while assets allocated for U . S . stocks rose . The Japan stock weighting dropped by 1 . 31 percentage points to 23 . 63 percent - - the lowest level since the survey began in June 1994 . The survey , conducted in January , asked 16 financial investors for their investment plans for February . Meanwhile , although investors voiced their concern that U . S . stocks were already high , the weighting in the market increased 0 . 59 percentage point to 40 . 83 percent . The overall asset allocation showed the weighting in stocks fell 0 . 50 percentage point to 45 . 75 percent while the weighting in bonds remained unchanged from January at 41 . 33 percent . The cash investment weighting edged up a notch , by 0 . 50 percentage point to 12 . 92 percent . Respondents said Japan ' s stock markets were dripping with downside risk . Pessimism about the Japanese economy in the fiscal year starting on April 1 and problems in the banking sector due to worries about bad loans were at the top of their list . Stagnant corporate profits resulting from a weak yen and sinking share prices were also a cause for concern , they said . " Banks shares have to stop falling before the stock market can turn around . But not only are stock prices of many financial institutions still higher than their lows recorded in August 1992 , there are fears of further unwinding in cross - shareholdings , " said Nikko Research Center . " The fear of more drops cannot be ignored . " On the U . S . stock market , investors said while they were still worried about a possible correction in store for the bull market , the overall tone was of a firm rising trend . " If we are to outdo the global index , then there ' s no way we can lower our weighting in U . S . stocks , " said Dowa Kasai Investment Management . Nomura Research Institute predicted that money flowing from the Japanese and European markets would be absorbed by U . S . stocks , putting more upward pressure on the dollar . Investors said that with a weak stock market , Japanese bonds would continue to remain firm , especially as the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its ultra - low interest rate levels on the back of fiscal tightening . The weighting in the domestic bond market rose 0 . 47 percentage point to 15 . 95 percent . The U . S . bond market weighting remained high , although it slipped for the first time in six months to 39 . 8 percent . " This is the most attractive market in the world , " said Nikko Securities Investment and Management . However , others warned of impending foreign exchange risks . " The difference in expected returns as compared with other markets is shrinking . As this is happening even with yen denominated bonds , on a global basis , the foreign exchange risk is gradually increasing , " said Yamaichi International Capital Management .

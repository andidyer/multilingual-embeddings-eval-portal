FEATURE - Dutch click funds woo risk - wary equity investors . A wave of new index - linked Dutch equity funds has attracted more than a billion guilders ( $ 540 million ) by overcoming small investors ' fears of losing their money . Issuers said these " click funds " , which use a mix of options to limit or eliminate downside risk , were proving very popular and that more money would inevitably flow into them . " The so - called click funds appeal to the typically Dutch risk - averse attitude , " said ING spokesman Wieger Sietsma . So far four banks and fund managers have launched funds which track the AEX index of 25 blue - chip Dutch shares , guaranteeing investors the benefits of a rise in the index , but protecting them against the risk of a possible fall . The funds differ but all promise to reimburse all , or almost all , of the initial investment if the index falls over a five - year period , or to match the index if it rises . Additionally , the funds lock in profits at a number of pre - determined index levels . Once one of these levels is reached , the fund " clicks " and retains the percentage gain achieved up to that point , even if the index drops again . Hence the name click fund . TWO TYPES OF INVESTORS DRAWN TO FUNDSSietsma said the funds drew two types of investors : those who already invested in equities but were anxious that prices might be set to fall and those who had their money in savings accounts but had been enviously eyeing the long equities rally . In 1996 the AEX posted a total return , including dividend income , of more than 41 percent , while the AMX index of medium - sized companies achieved a total return of more than 69 percent . Anxious about missing the boat but wary of buying at what might turn out to be the market ' s peak , retail investors have gratefully embraced the protection provided by the new funds . Investors have also been wooed by assurances from the fund managers that capital gains on the click funds will be tax - free . Capital gains on straight equity investments have long been untaxed in the Netherlands but losses are not tax - deductible . GENERALE BANK FIRST IN THE FIELDGenerale Bank was first to launch a click fund in the Netherlands , collecting almost 100 million guilders last summer for a fund with clicks on AEX index gains of 25 and 50 percent . Robeco followed , raising over 820 million guilders through two funds launched in October and December with clicks for every 10 percent the AEX rises up to 50 percent for the first fund and up to 60 percent for the second . ING raised some 270 million guilders in December for a fund with clicks on index gains of 25 and 50 percent . ING , Van Lanschot , Generale Bank and Robeco are all either launching or planning to launch new funds in the coming weeks . Generale Bank and Van Lanschot both buy baskets of shares which approximate the composition AEX index and hedge these with over - the - counter ( OTC ) options at different index levels . EXOTIC OPTIONSRobeco said it had bought three different sets of " exotic " OTC options from the Dutch co - operative bank Rabobank , while ING said only that it used a combination of puts and calls . Dealers said the launch of new click funds caused short - term upward pressure on share prices but that the effect was limited as purchases by the fund could be spread over several days . " One could say speculatively that it might push the index up about one or 1 . 5 points on such a day , " one dealer said . Share dealers and options traders said it was far more difficult to quantify the effect on prices of what happened when a fund was approaching one of its click levels . Sietsma said ING was considering applying the click fund formula to other baskets of shares than those in the AEX . " We ' ll definitely come up with something , but we won ' t say what ' s cooking until we make an official announcement , " he said .

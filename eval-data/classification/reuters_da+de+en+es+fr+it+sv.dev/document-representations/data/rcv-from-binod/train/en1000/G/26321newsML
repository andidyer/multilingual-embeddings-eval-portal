FEATURE - Finns flock to Estonia for food , fun and booze . Hundreds of thousands of Finns every year make the short trip to their small neighbour Estonia , bringing a consumer boom to the post - Soviet Baltic state as they seek cheap food , fun and especially drink . " We come here for women and for alchohol , " said Jari Huttanen , fresh off the ferry from Finland , swigging from a can and already a little drunk . Estonians view their guests with some amusement , glad for the cash the Finns spend in their capital but look askance at their sometimes rowdy , alchohol - fuelled behaviour . Finns feel at home in Estonia , independent from the former Soviet Union for five years , as the two peoples speak a similar language . But the real impetus for the consumer invasion is the incredibly cheap cigarettes , drink and food . Finns say prices can be around 30 to 40 percent cheaper than at home . Finland was even forced to adopt laws in May that cut the amount of drink that can be taken duty - free as day - trippers to Estonia and Russia flooded the home market with cheap booze . Finns now have to stay overnight if they want to qualify for big duty - free allowances and hoteliers and tourist officials say many are choosing to do just that . " People are staying longer and they are staying in hotels , " said Yrjo Vanhannen , the Finnish manager of the Viru Hotel , a mini sky - scraper that has been a magnet for Finns since the Soviet days . During 1995 , of the 2 . 1 million visitors to Estonia more than 70 percent were Finns . Most came only for the day , possible by ferry or fast hydrofoil across the short 90 km ( 55 miles ) which separates Tallinn and Helsinki . Estonian officials say passenger numbers fell immediately after the May 1 start of the new law but are now rising again . The Port of Tallinn said 989 , 323 people passed through it in the second quarter of the year , versus 834 , 730 people in the second quarter of 1995 . The Finnish visitors have helped turn Tallinn into a mini version of Helsinki , with its own branches of well - known Finnish stores , such as Stockmanns . Finns spent an estimated four to five billion kroons last year in Estonia ( $ 340 - 420 million ) . This comes on top of the millions of dollars which has been invested by Finnish companies into the Estonian economy . Estonians , more reserved than Finns , are generally positive about their cousins but Vanhanen said some people have a mixed attitude . " There is an ambivalent , love - hate relationship , " he said . " They ( Estonians ) call us reindeers because we act a little bit stupid and we walk around in herds , " Vanhannen added . The Viru has been a magnet for Finnish day - trippers since the Soviet days , when boatloads of notorious " vodka tourists " began to hit the city . He is candid over the drinking habits of his countrymen . " When they came here they were all drunk , they were like kings because they had money , " Vanhannen said , speaking of the first vodka tourists . Although the Finns feel at home in Estonia given the lingustic links , a mutual inferiority / superiority complex operates between the two nations , locals say . Some Finns view Estonians as the poor relations , still recovering from communism and with living standards well below those of Finland . The Estonians on the other hand see some vulgarity in the rowdy behavior of their cousins . As one Estonian official said jokingly : " You can tell which are the Finns , they are the loud ones " . But Estonians say that being so close to Finland during the 50 years of Soviet rule helped them escape the worst excesses of Sovietisation . Many people in the north of the country , including Tallinn , could watch Finnish television and had a better idea than most in the Soviet Union of what life was like in the West and what was going on in the world . One Estonian diplomat said Finnish television caused one of the largest population shifts in Estonian history when thousands of people travelled from the south to watch the famous French erotic film " Emanuelle " on Finnish television .

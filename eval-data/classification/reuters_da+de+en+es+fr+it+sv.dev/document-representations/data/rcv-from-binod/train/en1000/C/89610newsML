RTRS - Sky Channel , Tabcorp still in talks . Sports television broadcaster Sky Channel and wagering and gaming group Tabcorp Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday they remained in negotiations about the future supply of the sports channel to Tabcorp ' s betting agencies . " We ' re in dialogue virtually as we speak , " Sky managing director Bill North told Reuters . A Tabcorp spokeswoman said talks were ongoing but could not give any additional details . Sky has demanded from Tabcorp a 164 percent hike in annual fees for the channel , a move Tabcorp has said is not feasible and would put an impossible burden on its agencies . Tabcorp , which operates only in the state of Victoria , has until 0130 GMT ( 11 . 30 a . m . ) today to resolve the impasse with Sky or face having the service cut off to its 290 commissioned betting agencies , or TABs . North said he was hopeful of resolving the matter despite Sky ' s earlier rejection of a counter - offer by Tabcorp to pay a 150 percent fee increase . Under a contract that ran out in June , Tabcorp was charged about A $ 3 million a year for the channel , passing on about half of that cost to its TABs . Sky , owned equally by businessman Kerry Packer ' s Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd and Rupert Murdoch ' s News Corp Ltd , holds a virtual monopoly on direct tv broadcasts of Bgreyhound , thoroughbred and harness racing in Australia . The channel has maintained the price increase is intended to recoup the cost of securing sole broadcasting rights for Victorian content . The Victorian TABs association has said the channel is vital to attracting punters and more than half of the agencies in the state would have to close if they lost the broadcasts . Tabcorp has declined to comment on possible closures but said in a statement that it would try to minimise the effect on the company of losing Sky by transferring business to its other betting outlets , including clubs , hotels and racecourses who have separate contracts with Sky . In the year to June 30 , Tabcorp ' s net profit was A $ 63 . 4 million on turnover of A $ 557 million , 48 percent of which came from TAB agencies . - - Melbourne Bureau 61 - 3 9286 - 1435

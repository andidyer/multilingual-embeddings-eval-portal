Golden dreams ahead for Sri Lankan boy . A Sri Lankan schoolboy is looking forward to golden dreams after his family paid 405 , 000 rupees ( $ 7 , 230 ) on Sunday for a 24 - carat gold - plated bed imported for a former president . The auction of luxury goods imported for president Ranasinghe Premadasa but never used before his 1993 assassination , sparked unprecedented public interest , said auctioneer Dunstan Kelaart . " You can sleep and have golden dreams , " Kelaart told 16 - year - old Lalith Wasantha Konara after family friend Hilmi Mohamed fought off stiff bidding to buy the bed on his parents ' behalf . Premadasa served as president for more than four years before he was killed by a suspected separatist Tamil rebel suicide bomber during a May Day rally in the capital . Opponents of the populist leader often accused him and his family of enjoying an extravagant lifestyle at public expense in a country where the average income is about US $ 715 a year . Premadasa ' s daughter , Dulanjalee Jayakody , wrote to Sunday ' s The Island newspaper defending her father and saying the bed was never intended for him . Jayakody said her father led a spartan life and the bed was intended for VIP guests at a government guesthouse . The king - sized bed comes with a dresser , wardrobe and two side - tables , all with gold - plated trimmings . It was part of a consignment of luxury goods ordered by Premadasa but never used . It has spent the past three years in a sealed wharehouse . ( US $ 1 = 56 rupees )

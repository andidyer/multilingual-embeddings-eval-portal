" Guru " amuses , confuses with satirical biz babble . At first glance one might be forgiven for taking " The Book That ' s Sweeping America " as yet another bland North American management tome bristling with business babble and evangelical slogans . Such books are a dime a dozen and if they fail to reach the bestseller lists , they may at least achieve cult status or a place on the mahogany bookshelf ( usually unread ) . This book , cunningly written under the nom de plume Stephen Michael Peter Thomas , is published by John Wiley & Sons Inc . , the bluest of blue - chip business publishers and purveyors of such self - congratulatory bestsellers as " Warren Buffett ' s Way " , " Soros on Soros " and " Bloomberg by Bloomberg " . The cover picture of the smartly tailored " author " languidly perched upside down in a leather clubeasy chair is just the sort of thing one might expect from a Lee Iacocca , or a Michael Ovitz - - or Bloomberg or Soros for that matter . The book ' s core theoretical " learnings " - - leadership is hard ; communication is important ; change is different ; people are human , the future is tomorrow - - are only marginally more outrageous than some of the blindingly obvious claptrap that passes for serious wisdom uttered by management consultants and many of today ' s CEOs . There are many bad writers churning out serious management books . Fortunately " The Book That ' s Sweeping America " is not at all serious . It is true that the author , Boston - based consultant John Butman - - forget the Stephen Michael Peter Thomas psuedonynm for the moment - - is a very funny writer running riot with his subject . Suggested management training courses include joining a bomb disposal squad , changing a car tire at 80 miles an hour , taking charge of a " big ship " ( preferably an oil tanker ) as it hurtles toward a reef ; and the intriguingly titled " Roll the Product Marshmallow across the Hot Coals of Development " . This exercise exhorts executives to push a marshmallow across a bed of white - hot coals using their noses . To make it more challenging , the author suggests , " team members should be stripped naked , blindfolded , and lashed together with a high - speed , fire - resistant T - 3 data cable . " Such merciless spoofs of management games as well as reckless swipes at business jargon , organizational structure and some sage advice on creating a " humorless workplace " and " gender - neutral clothing guidelines " had this reviewer chortling out loud on a flight from Winnipeg to Calgary , during which I read the book in a single sitting . Having created corporate images for such gigantic concerns as Gillette , and written speeches for captains of industry such as the late great An Wang and Reebok ' s CEO Paul Fireman , author Butman is familiar with the top echelons of business . His vignette of meeting " faith - based finance " guru Dr . Vree Patchouk ( apparently loosely modelled on Deepak Chopra ) at his English country pile , is hysterical . Take the following gem : " With little effort , I could hear the sound of a butler polishing priceless Asprey silver in the dining room adjacent . I could hear the voices of workmen as they pulled a high - speed ISDN line through the 18th century walls to improve Internet response time . . . the first thought that came to mind was ' I wonder how much money this guy makes a year . ? ' " Like all good satire , " The Book That ' s Sweeping America " taps into some powerful realities . It will appeal to the disaffected of the business world in much the same way the cartoon strip " Dilbert " strikes a cord in any corporate cubicle denizen who has been senselessly trampled by management . Yet Wiley is clearly cautious about biting the hand that feeds . In searching for the desirable crossover market - - between the business book reader and mass market book buyer - - it has marketed the book by creating a whole persona around the fictional author Stephen Michael Peter Thomas . While this is amusing , particularly at bookstore signings , it is also confusing . Some reviewers immediately get it , others have not responded well . " A strangely unfunny April Fools Day spoof , " huffed one reviewer in London ' s Financial Times . Wiley might have done better not to take the joke too far .

Burma says Karen a threat , troops stay on border . Senior Burmese military officials said on Tuesday Karen National Union ( KNU ) guerrillas were still a threat and the government would keep troops at the Thai - Burmese border where the KNU is based as long as necessary . " The KNU can still be a threat to the government , " senior intelligence official Colonel Kyaw Thein told a monthly news conference . He said Burmese troops which have been involved in more than 100 border battles since February will remain as long as necessary to fight the last major ethnic group yet to sign a ceasefire agreement with Rangoon . Burmese troops sacked KNU mobile bases in the eastern part of the country last month in attacks which sent thousands of refugees and guerrillas scurrying for shelter into Thailand . Kyaw Thein said a total of 115 skirmishes had taken place in two separate areas along the border , killing nearly 100 KNU and government toops and wounding 85 . The troop movements should not harm relations between Thailand and Burma because the two sides had reached an understanding over the border action , officials said . " There shall not be any effect on the continuing bilateral relations between Myanmar ( Burma ) and Thailand , " foreign minister Ohn Gyaw said . " Before any action was taken we kept the Thai authorities informed . . . of the intended action . We have not intended to hurt the bilateral relations and the Thai government understands it very well , " he said . The KNU , formed in 1948 , has rejected several peace overtures from the Rangoon military government . Kyaw Thein said the latest series of attacks in February followed the failure of a fourth round of peace talks between the two sides in December . Kyaw Thein said the government was willing to hold further peace talks with the KNU . " The situation right now depends on the KNU , whether they genuinely wish for peace , " he said . " If they wish for peace then the door is always open . But . . . the government has clearly stated some terms for them , if they are willing to accept the terms the government has laid down then we will be able to continue peace talks . " Kyaw Thein said the stumbling blocks in the previous rounds of talks had to do with wording on " renouncing armed struggle and returning to the legal fold " . The other 15 ethnic groups which have signed ceasefire deals with the government have not given up their arms , but have agreed not to wage armed struggle , he said . The government is also worried about increased terrorism attacks by the KNU , officials said , citing a bomb attack on a Buddhist shrine in Rangoon on Christmas Day for which the guerrillas were blamed .

S . African ANC members seek political amnesty . President Nelson Mandela on Friday extended the scope of South Africa ' s post - apartheid " truth commission " to include a white rightist bid to derail democracy and gave offenders five months longer to seek pardon . Mandela said those guilty of human rights abuses in the fight over apartheid would have until next May to apply for amnesty under South Africa ' s reconciliation programme . He set May 10 , 1994 , the day of his own inauguration as the country ' s first democratically elected president , as the cut - off date for crimes which could qualify for pardon . " This is one of the most difficult decisions I have had to take . Much pain and suffering has been wrought on families , communities and the nation as a whole by acts of the nature for which amnesty is to be requested and possibly granted , " Mandela said in a statement read to a news conference as he looked on . " But I have decided to take this decision , because on balance I am persuaded that it will further consolidate nation - building and reconciliation in a manner that is all - inclusive . " Meanwhile spokesman for Mandela ' s African National Congress ( ANC ) Ronnie Mamoepa told Reuters the party had submitted 60 amnesty applications , including those for three cabinet ministers and a deputy minister , to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) . " The applications were filed earlier on Friday and include those for ( Defence Minister Joe ) Modise , ( Telecommunications Minister Jay ) Naidoo , ( Police Minister Sydney ) Mufamadi , " Mamoepa said . Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils also sought amnesty . " The TRC has also told us it has received about 300 applications from people said to be ANC members , " he added . He declined to say for which offences the four ministers had applied for amnesty . Some leaders of the ANC have argued that veterans of the movement ' s guerrilla army did not need amnesty for actions that were part of " a just war " . Apartheid ' s foes and defenders had been given until midnight on Saturday to seek pardon for crimes committed with a political motive before December 6 , 1993 . But Archbishop Desmond Tutu , chairman of the statutory TRC empowered to grant amnesty , had asked for extensions to allow more people to be included . Conservative Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen , once commander of apartheid armed forces , also asked for the date to be moved . This was so that amnesty could be considered for bombers convicted of killing at least 21 people in the run - up to the April 1994 all - race elections , and others who plotted a coup against democracy at the time of the first all - race election . Mandela said he had listened to arguments by Tutu and Viljoen and reflected intensely before deferring to their wisdom and good faith . The president had been against extending the amnesty because he did not want to undermine his government ' s determination to deal firmly with all criminal actions . He appealed to those who had not yet applied for pardons to do so " to unearth the truth , to bring succour to the victims and to promote justice in our new and democratic South Africa " . Viljoen told the news conference he would apply for amnesty for acts of resistance before the 1994 elections and that he was " delighted " Mandela had agreed to the extension .

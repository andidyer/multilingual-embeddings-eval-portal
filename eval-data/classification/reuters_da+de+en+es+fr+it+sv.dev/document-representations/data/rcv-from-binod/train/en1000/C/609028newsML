Reebok de Mexico plans $ 6 mln factory . Reebok de Mexico SA , a division of Reebok International Ltd , said on Thursday it was planning to build a $ 6 million factory in Mexico ' s Guanajuato state this year . The firm ' s commercial director , Fernando Rotter , said the plant , planned for this year , would bring sales totaling an estimated 260 million pesos . " The company is investing a little more than $ 6 million in the construction of a new plant in Celaya , Guanajuato , that will bring employment to 1 , 000 people , " he said . Footwear was among those sectors of the Mexican economy to suffer most in the 1994 peso devaluation , but Rotter said the fall in sales was one of the reasons for going ahead with the new plant . " In order to recover the market , we have only this alternative - - to invest in Mexico and with this strategy win back the national market , " he said . The plant will have a capacity of 1 . 5 million pairs per year , allowing Reebok to satisfy the national market and export high quality shoes to Brazil , the United States and Argentina , he said . He said Reebok had been ranked first in consumer preference in Mexico until the end of 1996 , when it was overtaken by Nike . ( ( - - Mexico City Newsroom + 525 728 7912 ) )

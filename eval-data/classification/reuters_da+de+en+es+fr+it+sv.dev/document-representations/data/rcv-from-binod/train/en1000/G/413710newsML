ETA must offer longer truce than one week - minister . Basque separatist rebels must launch a lengthy truce if they wish the government to consider talks but they are neither willing nor able to do so now , Basque Interior Minister Juan Maria Atutxa said . " There has to be a serious truce , " Atutxa told El Pais in an interview published on Sunday . " A truce of one week is a joke , " he said . " Its purpose is to show people that the ' enemy ' isn ' t capable of sitting down with them and that they should continue killing , " Atutxa said . Last summer , ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) , which has killed some 800 people in its 30 - year drive for independence , sparked the first hopes of peace talks in a decade when it announced a one - week truce . That truce was largely symbolic , since the frequency of ETA attacks at the time was far less than one a week , and it did not dissuade the conservative government from its demands that ETA lay down arms before talks could be considered . Atutxa said a forum for any such talks would be the Ajuria Enea pact , a roundtable of six political parties set up in 1988 to seek peace in the troubled Basque region . " With a long truce - - not one of a week - - that made ETA ' s will known , the roundtable of Ajuria Enea would value very positively that willingness so that one could reach a hypothetical negotiated settlement , " Atutxa said . But he said ETA , which has stepped up its attacks this year , is neither willing nor able to impose a truce now . The rebels have killed six people in 1997 , more than those murdered during all of 1996 . " I doubt that at the moment ETA would dare to take a definitive step and demostrate its unequivocal will for a negotiated solution , " Atutxa said , " because , among other reasons , ETA ' s leadership isn ' t capable of imposing order on its own ranks .

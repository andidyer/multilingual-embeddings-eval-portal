Unilever says policy unchanged on soybeans . Unilever NV said on Thursday a decision by its German unit not to sell products containing edible oils made from genetically modified soybeans did not change the company ' s overall stance on the issue . " Unilever ' s policy is unchanged . We regard the beans as completely safe , " a spokesman for the Anglo - Dutch company said . He said the decision by the German unit was made in response to views held by German consumers , was particular to that country and would not be applied elsewhere . " We are a consumer driven company and we have to take their wishes into account , " he said . " They ( the German unit ) have said they needed more time to consult on this and we think that ' s the best way to proceed . " Greenpeace has staged a widespread campaign against the new beans , imported from the United States , which have been genetically modified to be resistant to a weed - killer in a technique developed by chemicals company Monsanto Co . - - Amsterdam Newsroom + 31 20 504 500

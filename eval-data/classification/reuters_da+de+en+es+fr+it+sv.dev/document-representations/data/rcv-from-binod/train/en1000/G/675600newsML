World seen shifting to common environment approach . A world convention on endangered species which ends in Zimbabwe on Friday will be remembered for acrimonious debates that put into sharp focus global differences in policies on environmental issues . But some environmental and political analysts say the end result showed that many countries were moving , though slowly , towards a common approach on environmental and wildlife management . There was a shift across the globe , from the United States to little Lesotho , toward the concept of sustainable utilisation of resources , they said . " The debate is over the interpretation , over whether use is good for all or for one , or injurious , " said David Western , head of the Kenyan delegation to the CITES meeting . Differences over interpretation were put into focus by a controversial proposal by three southern African states to be exempted from a seven - year - old ban in ivory trade on grounds that they have too many elephants . The debate was bitter and long , but the 10 - day Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) eventually agreed on a watered - down amendment allowing Botswana , Namibia and Zimbabwe to sell some ivory to Japan on an " experimental " basis in 1999 if their control measures satisfied CITES . Initially , few delegates thought it would pass , pointing at the strong anti - trade lobby . " It passed because all the differences are slowly being resolved . It passed because the world wants to test the management system , " said Taparandava Maveneka , chief executive of Zimbabwe ' s rural community environment and wildlife programme , CAMPFIRE . " Of course the world remains divided now over what is sustainable utilisation of resources but positions are shifting , " he told Reuters . European Union states abstained from voting on easing the ivory trade ban because they had failed to reach a consensus . Switzerland broke ranks with most of the West to support the southern African proposal , making scathing attacks on the rich North for allegedly failing to listen to reason . Botswana , Namibia and Zimbabwe argued throughout that CITES should link environmental conservation to sustainable utilisation , a concept Japan and China said they strongly backed . Liberia on the other hand accused Zimbabwe of hypocrisy and of trying to bully fellow African states to its side . The United States - - which successfully co - sponsored a proposal to list big leaf mahogany as an endangered species - - Australia and Israel spoke stoutly against reopening ivory trade , but all said they were for sustainable utilisation . " We just don ' t think it ' s the time now , " a U . S . delegate said , adding after the conditional acceptance to ease the trade ban that Washington would work hard to ensure the elephant survived trade . " For the sake of the elephant we cannot afford to fail . " In another move also seen by some delegates as a sign of U . S . support for sustainable use of resources , Washington and Bonn co - sponsored a proposal that placed the sturgeon fish on a list of species that should be traded under control . " I think in the past , the U . S . would have asked CITES to impose a trade ban straight away , " one delegate said . South African Environment Deputy Minister Peter Mokaba said CITES ' future would be secured by narrowing differences in interpretation , and improved management of flora and fauna . " Differences themselves are not bad as long as we are prepared to address them , " he said . Mokaba and South African ambassador to Zimbabwe Kingsley Mamabolo are credited by many EU delegates for working hard to help produce the compromise that won the conditional easing of the ivory trade ban . " This shows that Africa badly needs to develop the diplomatic skills to present its cases , " said Lupi Mushayakarara , a leading Zimbabwean political commentator .

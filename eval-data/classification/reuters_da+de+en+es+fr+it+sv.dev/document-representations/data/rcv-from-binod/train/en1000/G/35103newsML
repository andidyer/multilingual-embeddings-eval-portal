NASA sets Sept . 16 launch for Atlantis . Space shuttle Atlantis , whose launch was delayed by the approach of Hurricane Fran , will lift off before dawn on Sept . 16 , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said on Thursday . NASA managers approved Atlantis ' return to the launch pad complex very early on Thursday morning , just one day after the shuttle was forced into its hangar by fears that Fran might strike central Florida . But Hurricane Fran headed north past Florida , and on Thursday was threatening landfall along the Carolina coast . The delay extended by two days the stay in space of Shannon Lucid , a U . S . astronaut who has been working aboard the orbiting Russian Mir space station since March . Lucid , a biochemist and 53 - year - old mother of three , was originally due home in early August . But that return was put off for six weeks because of problems with the shuttle ' s booster rockets . Atlantis is now set to lift off to retrieve Lucid at 4 : 54 a . m . EDT ( 0854 GMT ) on Sept . 16 on a mission that would conclude on Sept . 26 with a landing at the Kennedy Space Centre .

Indonesia labour leader sentence reimposed - paper . Indonesia ' s Supreme Court has reimposed a four - year sentence on independent labour leader Muchtar Pakpahan for inciting workers to riot in 1994 , newspaper reports said on Tuesday . Lawyers and friends close to Pakpahan were unable to confirm the reports . They said they had not been officially notified of the decision . The Republika daily quoted sources in Medan State Court as saying they had received a letter on Monday notifying them of the Supreme Court ' s decision on October 25 to reverse its previous decision to quash Pakpahan ' s sentence . Pakpahan is currently being held at the Attorney General ' s office after he was arrested in July on separate subversion charges in the wake of riots in Jakarta that month . Subversion carries a maximum penalty of death in Indonesia . A spokesman at the Supreme Court said only the General Secretary Mangatas Nasution was qualified to comment on the newspaper reports but he was not available to take calls . Pakpahan , head of the unrecognised Indonesian Labour Welfare Union ( SBSI ) , was sentenced in November 1994 to three years in prison for inciting riots in the city of Medan in April that year . The sentence was increased to four years on appeal by the High Court . Pakpahan was then freed in May last year by the Supreme Court which later quashed the conviction in September 1995 . Pakpahan ' s lawyer Lutfie Hakim told Reuters he had not yet been notified of the decision by the Supreme Court . Hakim said such a decision would be illegal as the Supreme Court had already quashed charges against Pakpahan and under Indonesian law only the defendant had the right to appeal against the decision . " According to Indonesian law . . . the right for a judicial review is held by the defendant and his family , " Hakim said . The government blamed the July riots , the worst for more than 20 years , on the small leftist People ' s Democratic Party ( PRD ) which it says is a neo - Communist organisation . Pakpahan was originally arrested as part of a probe into PRD leader Budiman Sudjatmiko who the government accuses of masterminding the riots .

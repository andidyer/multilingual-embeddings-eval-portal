Norway sets Feb 5 deadline for Barents Sea round . Norway on Friday set a deadline of February 5 , 1997 for applications to drill for oil in the Barents Sea , the energy ministry said in a statement released in Oslo . Production licenses should be awarded by March or April next year , the ministry added . " We ' re confirming the time schedule and publishing the details of the blocks on offer , " said ministry spokeswoman Anne Ekern . Companies will be able to bid for the rights to explore about 45 blocks in six areas of the southern Barents Sea . In August , the ministry said it was very satisfied with the renewed interest shown in the Arctic waters . Eight groups of 12 companies recommended blocks for exploration , Ekern said on Friday . The companies were Amerada Hess Corp , Amoco Corp , Elf Aquitaine , Enterprise Oil Plc , Mobil Corp , Neste Oy , Norsk Agip , Norsk Hydro ASA , Phillips Petroleum Co , Saga Petroleum ASA , Statoil ( Den norske stats oljeselskap and Conoco . Although acreage in the Barents Sea has been offered in two previous exploration rounds , no oil has been found though gas has been detected in small deposits that were not considered economical . " There is still reason to assume that significant volumes of petroleum resources remain in the Barents Sea , " said state secretary Odd Erik Hansgaard . " The challenge in the future will be to discover these resources , and by doing so , to ensure further petroleum - related activity , " he said . Terms and conditions have been revised to attract new interest in the area , which was first explored in 1980 , but industry sources say the current licensing round could be make or break for the region . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7930

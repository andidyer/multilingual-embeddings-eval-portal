Ecuador Congress raises corporate income tax . Ecuador ' s Congress has voted to raise income tax paid by companies , a congressional spokesman said Thursday . Congress late Wednesday approved a partial presidential veto to earlier tax legislation , backing changes to the ICE tax on special consumption and raising income tax to 25 percent from 20 percent , the source told Reuters . The new tax law favors tobacco , liquor and car manufacturers , reducing their ICE payments . Tax on cigarettes made from blonde tobacco will be lowered to 75 percent from 103 percent and that on cigarettes with black tabacco to 18 percent from 48 percent . Liquor tax was cut to 26 percent from 43 percent . The law , which will be enacted over the next few days , does not specify how much the government hopes to collect in new revenues but legislators estimate that amount at $ 149 million ( 600 , 000 sucres ) . Ecuador ' s fiscal deficit is running at six percent of gross domestic product . ( ( - - Quito Newsroom 5932 258429 ) )

Italian govt promises to present budget by Easter . The Italian government , racing against time to get the economy in shape for the European single currency , said on Thursday it would unveil its eagerly - awaited mini - budget by the end of March . But even before the package has been presented , Prime Minister Romano Prodi ran into a wall of opposition from union and industrial leaders who warned of dire consequences if their members were hit for more cash . Cabinet secretary Enrico Micheli told reporters that first quarter state accounts , which will be used to determine how much money is needed , would be ready by the end of this week . " We will do the budget by Easter , " Micheli said . Easter Sunday falls on March 30 . Some observers had speculated that Prime Minister Romano Prodi might wait until after local elections on April 27 before unleashing more budget rigour . Prodi has said a mini - budget is needed to tame an expected overshoot in 1997 accounts and ensure Italy meets criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty for countries wishing to join European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) . Treasury sources indicated earlier this month that 14 - 15 trillion lire ( $ 8 . 3 - $ 8 . 9 billion ) had to be raised by the end of the year if Italy was to reduce its deficit to three percent of gross domestic product , as demanded by Maastricht . However Italian news agency Ansa , quoting unnamed sources , reported on Thursday that the quarterly accounts showed an additional 15 . 5 trillion lire would be required this year . The Italian Treasury has introduced heavy doses of budget medicine in recent years in a bid to restore state accounts to health after government spending sprees in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The last round of belt tightening came at the end of 1996 , when Prodi ' s centre - left administration introduced a hefty 62 . 5 trillion lire deficit - cutting package . But the overshoot in last year ' s expenditure pushed the deficit / GDP ratio to 6 . 8 percent , making more budget pain necessary . Analysts expect the forthcoming mini - budget to raise up to eight trillion lire by transfering employee severance payment funds from company accounts into Treasury coffers . At present , these funds are often used as cashflow by Italian firms and the director general of industrialists ' federation Confindustria said his organisation would fight Prodi if he attempted to commandeer this money . " There are boundaries which should not be crossed except during emergencies , such as war , " Innocenzo Cipolletta said . " To deprive firms of their liquidity risks breaking the code of trust that exists between state and civil society . I hope the government listens to the companies , " he told a conference . Analysts say the government is also likely to seek up to two trillion lire from a one - off solidarity tax aimed at people who took early retirement , as well as increase charges for certain hospital services . Sergio Cofferati , head of Italy ' s largest union federation , CGIL , on Thursday warned Prodi against such measures . " The government knows that we are against a budget which hurts pensions and health spending . I hope it takes this into account . If not , it will have to face the hostility of the unions , " Cofferati said .

O ' Leary to study ideas to bolster heat oil supply . U . S . Energy Secretary Hazel O ' Leary committed Tuesday to study proposals by Northeastern lawmakers and find ways to prevent a spike in heating oil prices this winter . " We want to see how we can mitigate against price increases , " O ' Leary said after a meeting with Democrats Sen . Joseph Lieberman and Sen . Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Rep . Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts . " Through next week , what I ' ve committed to is going back and taking a hard look at some very creative ideas , which will likely require some additional authority , " O ' Leary said , referring to proposals by the lawmakers for the Energy Department to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to build up a reserve of heating oil . She said the Energy Department would work with other countries that export petroleum products to the United States . An Energy Department official going to Venezuela Tuesday on an unrelated matter " will raise the issue of are there extra barrels to come from Venezuela , " she said . Northeastern governors concerned about high heating bills for poor people should apply to the Health and Human Services Department for low - income home energy assistance program ( LIHEAP ) funds , O ' Leary said , adding that the program had $ 400 million available immediately . She said repeatedly that she would not try to regulate the oil market . " This secretary is not proposing that she gets into the regulatory business , " she told reporters . " We need to keep our eye on this market , " she said . " We will continue to monitor diesel supply and price three times a week as opposed to once a week . " Rep . Kennedy raised concern about the high volume of U . S . distillate exports going to Europe , and suggested something should be done to " turn those ships around . " But O ' Leary told reporters " we don ' t " have authority to do that . She said Europe was attracting product from the United States because product was commanding higher prices there . To ensure that supplies could be moved around the United States easily during the winter , the Energy Department was in touch with Transportation Secretary Federico Pena , she said . Petroleum marketers discussing the possibility of short supplies last week said the government should speed up its process of issuing shipping waivers , to ensure that product could move between U . S . ports on foreign - flagged vessels if U . S . - flagged tankers were unavailable . They also said the government should allow truckers to drive beyond their eight - hour limit if marketers are facing difficulty receiving product .

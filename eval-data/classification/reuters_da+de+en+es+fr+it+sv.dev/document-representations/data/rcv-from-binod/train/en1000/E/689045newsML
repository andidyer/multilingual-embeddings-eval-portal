RBNZ endorses 100 b . point easing from Mar level . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand in its six - monthly Monetary Policy Statement on Friday said it wants monetary conditions the equivalent of 100 basis points easier than it set in its March Economic Projections . The bank projected its nominal Monetary Conditions Index , which was given an arbitrary December quarter base of 1000 , to average 825 over the September quarter . The index is seen moving to 785 in the December quarter and to 808 in the March 1998 quarter . The bank expects underlying inflation of 0 . 3 percent in the June quarter , remaining flat at that level in the September and December 1997 quarters . Core inflation is then picked to drop to 0 . 1 percent in the March 1998 quarter . In annual terms , underlying inflation is expected to be 1 . 0 percent in the March 1998 year , and at 1 . 1 and 1 . 7 percent for the succeeding March years . In its previous forecasts in March , the bank saw inflation falling from 2 . 2 percent in the March 1997 year to a low of 0 . 8 percent in most of 1998 . The MCI is a composite of 90 - day bank bills and the New Zealand dollar Trade - Weighted Index . According to the bank ' s desired conditions of bank bills at 7 . 5 percent and the TWI at 68 . 0 set in March , the MCI was at 925 .

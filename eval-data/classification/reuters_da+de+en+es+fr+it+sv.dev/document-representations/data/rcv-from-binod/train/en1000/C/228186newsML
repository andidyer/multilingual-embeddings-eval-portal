Venezuela CVG $ 300 mln shr issue to reduce debt . A $ 300 million local share offering slated for early 1997 by Venezuelan state - owned industrial complex Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana ( CVG ) will be used to capitalize debt , CVG President Elias Ynaty said . The CVG ' s aluminum arm currently has over $ 1 . 25 billion in debt , while the iron and steel arm has debt totaling some $ 600 million . CVG and government officials have long struggled to find ways to reduce the companies ' debt burden before they are sold at auction early next year for some $ 3 . 2 billion . " Part of the debt ( 80 percent ) will be assumed by the new buyers , " Ynaty told Reuters . But Venezuelans will also be able to buy a small share of the companies as part of a program designed to spread share ownership as widely as possible . " The other part ( of the debt ) will be capitalized and sold as part of the public participation campaign , " Ynaty said . " In effect , Venezuelans will be buying a kind of debt bond , " he added . The public participation scheme follows on similar schemes used to quell opposition to the privatization of telephone company CANTV , and the slated sales of Banco de Venezuela and Banco Consolidado , due December 19 . - - Omar Lugo , Caracas newsroom , 582 505 2600

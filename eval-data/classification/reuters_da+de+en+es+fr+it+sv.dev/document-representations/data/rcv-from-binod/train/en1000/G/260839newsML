Rapturous return home for Zaire ' s Mobutu . Zaire ' s veteran president , Mobutu Sese Seko , returned home to a rapturous welcome on Tuesday , saying he had defied doctors ' orders to come and pledged not to flinch from the crisis facing the nation . Up to 20 , 000 people packed Njili international airport outside the capital Kinshasa to welcome home the man whose supporters describe him as the one symbol of unity in the anarchic Central African nation gripped by a revolt in the east . Many tens of thousands more lined his route from the airport through the teeming capital of five million people to his fortified hilltop residence in the Ngaliama district . " Each time that Zaire has been threatened in the past , I have never pulled back . I will never pull back , " Mobutu , 66 , told supporters after four months absence in Europe where he had surgery for prostate cancer in August . Many Zaireans are looking to Mobutu , who has dominated the life of the chaotic Central African nation since seizing power in 1965 , to conjure up a solution to end the Tutsi - led revolt in the east , where rebels have seized territory and towns . " I cannot let you down . I know your expectations and your hopes . I will devote myself to finding a rapid and positive response in the higher interest of the nation , " he said . He gave his 15 - minute address , which was broadcast live by state radio , after arriving at the residence . Tight security surrounded the homecoming with army sharp - shooters on rooftops at the airport and civil guard troops in trucks along the road from the capital . The crowds , many of them wearing clothes with his image on , surged forward as the plane taxied to a halt . Brass bands played loudly and supporters danced and sang . Mobutu smiled broadly as he walked down the steps from the aircraft with his wife , Bobi Ladawa . Wearing his trade - mark leopard - skin hat , he walked unaided and easily , carrying , as always , a carved walking stick . Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo waited at the aircraft steps . No opposition personalities were in evidence . Two small girl in white dresses handed the president a huge bouquet of flowers . He shook hands all round and , standing erect , joined in singing the national anthem . Crowds cheered and he raised his arms in acknowledgement . Mobutu and his wife later left the airport by car with the fiercely loyal presidential guard protecting their convoy during a journey that took him through many of the populous districts of the capital . Mobutu , who has clung to power in Zaire with military might and political acumen , bowed to foreign and domestic pressure for democratic reforms in 1990 but elections have yet to be held . Local newspapers of all political tendencies have speculated on the implications of Mobutu ' s return and possible changes in the government and the military . They were sharply divided on whether his presence would make any difference on the warfront . Aides say he is feeling better after surgery for cancer in Switzerland in August . He has been staying at his private villa at Roquebrune - Cap - Martin near Nice since November 4 . Mobutu said he had returned against medical advice . " I could not remain unmoved in the face of the worsening situation in the east of the county and the appeals , so , against the advice of doctors , I decided to break my stay in France to continue my convalesence in the midst of my people , " he said .

GrainCorp Australia in A $ 25 mln facilities upgrade . GrainCorp , the leading grain handling co - operative of the Australian state of New South Wales , said on Monday it would spend a record A $ 25 million this year to upgrade storage and handling facilities . Speaking at this week ' s post - harvest grower meetings , GrainCorp managing director Tom Keene said the injection of funds reflected the group ' s increasing commitment to improving grower services since privatisation in 1992 . In two years , the group would have put A $ 45 million back into the company . The aim now was to receive a grower ' s crop in 10 - 15 days , he said . In 1991 , before privatisation , only A $ 7 million was spent on capital improvements , compared with A $ 20 million last year and the further A $ 25 million this year , he said . Based on GrainCorp ' s record receivals of 8 . 3 million tonnes in the 1996 / 97 harvest , this year ' s A $ 25 million equated to about A $ 3 . 00 a tonne , he said . Most of the A $ 25 million would be spent on country facility improvement projects . Expenditure would cover shed sealing , site upgrading , new equipment , receival upgradings and new weighbridges . Keene told the post - harvest meetings that 8 . 3 million tonnes of grain was received at 214 sites and 136 bunkers during the 1996 / 97 harvest . On the biggest day nearly 300 , 000 tonnes were received into the system . Grain Corp this year successfully paid off the A $ 100 million debt incurred when the company was bought by the grower organisation Prime Wheat Association in 1992 , he said . Keene compared performances between handling of the two record harvests of 1983 / 84 and 1996 / 97 . In 1983 / 84 , the system received 8 . 3 million tonnes in 16 weeks . In 1996 / 97 , GrainCorp handled the same amount in eight weeks he said . Daily take receivals in 1996 / 97 were three times greater than the best achieved in 1983 / 84 . Costs for receiving the crop in 1996 / 97 were half that of 1983 / 84 , yet customer demands and segregation requirements were far greater , he said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

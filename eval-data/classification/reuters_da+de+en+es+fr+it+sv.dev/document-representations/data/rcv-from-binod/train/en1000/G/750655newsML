Model Elle MacPherson denies having " boy toy " . Model Elle MacPherson spoke out for the first time on Tuesday about two men accused of blackmailing her and threatening to put stolen nude photographs of her on the Internet . She said she had never met either of the men who have been charged with extortion and denied she had a " boy toy " relationship with one of them . In her first comments on the case , MacPherson told reporters that she wanted to " clear the record . " She said that on June 12 there was a burglary at her Los Angeles home in which $ 100 , 000 worth of jewelry and some cash were stolen . Also taken were some photographs of the tall Australian model . " There were some nude or partially nude photographs and there was a series of black - and - white ones that I had initially intended for a book , " she said . " I wish to clarify that the photographs were taken by myself using a camera that had a self - timer , " MacPherson said . She said the burglar later contacted her by phone and mail and threatened to release the nude pictures onto the Internet if she did not pay $ 60 , 000 . She notified the police and the two men were arrested when they picked up the money at a Beverly Hills shopping mall . Michael Mischler , 29 , has pleaded innocent to two counts of burglary and six extortion counts . William Holt , 26 , has pleaded innocent to two counts of extortion . Both men are due to appear at a preliminary hearing on July 29 . Mischler ' s lawyer has said he will use an insanity defence , arguing that any man would " go crazy " being spurned by one of the world ' s most beautiful women . MacPherson , who has appeared in several films , including the current " Batman and Robin " , disputed comments by the lawyer that Mischler had a relationship with her and that she had given him the photographs . " There was even a mention of him being my ' boy toy ' - - whatever that is , " she said . " All of this is completely untrue . I have never met Mr . Mischler and with any luck , I will never , ever meet Mr . Mischler . "

New Hong Kong airport fee talks deferred until Oct . A seventh round of talks between the Airport Authority and airline representatives has ended with airlines still not knowing how much they will have to pay to use Hong Kong ' s new airport due to open in nine months time , airline sources told Reuters . Two days of talks , which an Authority spokesman described as good , business - like discussions , ended on Thursday with both sides agreeing to reconvene on October 7 - 9 in a further effort to resolve the controversial issue of landing and user fees at Chek Lap Kok . Cathay Pacific Airways Limited and Hong Kong Dragon Airlines ( Dragonair ) , which will both have their new operational base at Chek Lap Kok , and other carriers fear it will become the world ' s third most expensive airport , badly damaging profit levels and cause marginal , short haul services to be cancelled . The Authority has in the past rejected " misleading and unhelpful " allegations that Chek Lap Kok will be one of the world ' s most expensive and hit back at critics by saying airlines will benefit from new facilities and new opportunities . An Authority spokesman said both sides had agreed to wait until October when a clearer picture of the expected revenue from the airport ' s retailing operation should be known . Airlines hope higher than expected revenue from the airport ' s potentially lucrative Skymall shopping operation could help offset landing and parking charges , sources confirmed . The deputy chairman of the Board of Airline Representatives , Gilbert Chow , said he is still awaiting for a revised proposal of charges which had been previously promised by the Authority . Now the Authority won ' t be able to give a clearer indication until all commercial operations franchises are in place later this year , he said . " Getting it right first time is the most important thing because it is going to affect all of us for the rest of our lives . Our major concern remains making sure the charges are reasonable and we can live with them , " Chow said .

An Internet old - timer - - e - mail - - is hot , hot , hot . E - mail is big , and getting bigger . The Internet staple is being sliced , diced , pushed , pulled and served up in any number of new entrees as e - mail software companies , publishers and others look to profit from the fundamental urge to communicate . In recent months , amid the influx of consumers jumping online , companies offering lifetime e - mail addresses or free e - mail have popped up by the dozens . So have free or subscription - based services that broadcast news , weather , sports and other customised data to people ' s e - mailboxes . Web - based mail , mailboxes incorporated in Web browsers , is booming . In a twist on the " push " technology popularised by PointCast , some players are offering e - mail services that deliver Web pages - - with all the multimedia bells and whistles - - to Web browser mailboxes instead of making people surf for the information they want . " It ' s truly arrived . E - mail is the killer app so far in the online world , " said Kate Delhagen , a Forrester Research analyst in Cambridge , Mass . E - mail is predicted to become ever more ubiquitous over the next five years , according to a recent Forrester report . By 2001 , the number of Americans with e - mail access should shoot to 135 million - - roughly half the population - - from 40 million today , as more families buy personal computers and companies offer more employees Internet access , according to the report . Likewise , the volume of e - mail traffic will skyrocket , with Americans sending 500 million personal messages a day five years from now , and 5 billion a day by 2005 , according to the report . Delhagen envisions a day when e - mail will function as what she calls a " personal information store , " collecting , filtering and archiving business correspondence , bills , catalogues , advertisements and letters from Mom , and forwarding it to telephone answering machines , public e - mail kiosks , even e - mail watches . Some future - sounding applications are already here . People who sign up for a free lifetime e - mail address from Bigfoot ( http : / / www . bigfoot . com / ) , the e - mail directory , can pay $ 14 . 95 a month to have e - mail forwarded to a pager or palmtop computer . Next month , Microsoft and Octel Communications , the voice - mail company , are expected to announce a service called Unified Messenger that combines voice mail and e - mail . The companies won ' t comment before the official unveiling Feb . 18 , but recent news reports said the service will allow people to listen to their e - mail from a cell phone or phone in messages that would be delivered as e - mail . The combination hardware - software product is expected to ship in May and cost less than $ 200 per mailbox . Over the past six months , dozens of companies have begun offering lifetime e - mail addresses , catering to people who constantly switch Internet service providers , and e - mail addresses . E - mail forwarders provide a cover address that automatically sends mail to any address the subscriber chooses . Some , such as Mailbank ( http : / / mailbank . com / ) , offer " vanity " addresses with domain names such as " admirer . com , " " equalrights . com " or " skydiver . com . " Some e - mail forwarders charge a couple of dollars a month for their services , but more are waiving fees in hopes of supporting their ventures through advertising . That ' s what happened at USA . Net ( http : / / netaddress . usa . net ) , a private Colorado Springs , Colo . , company that stopped charging for its NetAddress lifetime e - mail service after eight months and relaunched a free , ad - supported service in December . Since then , the company has added 200 , 000 subscribers and is signing up 2 , 000 new users a day . The first ads go online this weekend , said John Street , USA . Net president and founder . " I ' ve noodled around with this for a long time and it ' s for real , " Street said . Another Colorado company , Mercury Mail ( http : / / www . merc . com / ) in Denver , has had similar success with a free custom news service broadcast to subscribers ' e - mailboxes . Since going online in June , Mercury Mail has signed up 700 , 000 subscribers who select from news , weather , sports , stock and entertainment topics . The company is just beginning to go after ads . Mercury Mail recently signed onto Netscape ' s Inbox Direct programme , which allows people who use Netscape Navigator 3 . 0 to receive e - mail messages formatted as Web pages in the browser ' s built - in mailbox . Since Netscape launched Inbox Direct in October , more than 3 . 5 million people have signed up for the free service and the company has partnered with 50 publishers , most recently the Wall Street Journal , USA Today , and Sports Illustrated . " It ' s a huge success because we can ( bundle ) content that is relevant to people and deliver it to them , " said Jennifer Bailey , Netscape customer marketing vice president . " From the content provider side , they can give people information in a form that ' s more interesting to read . " Netscape is getting some competition . Earlier this week , U . S . Interactive ( http : / / www . usinteractive . com / ) introduced Digital Bindery , which also delivers Web pages to subscribers via e - mail . Whereas Netscape ' s service requires that users run Navigator software , Digital Bindery works with other e - mail programmes , including popular software such as Eudora Pro and cc : mail .

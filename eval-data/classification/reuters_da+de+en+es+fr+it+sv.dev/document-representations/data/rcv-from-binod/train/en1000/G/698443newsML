" New Labour " Britain seems keen to play Africa role . The new Labour government in Britain is pushing an upbeat message on Africa but Nigeria ' s military regime can expect tougher treatment from the former colonial power . After 18 years of Conservative rule , the country which colonised half of Africa is having a fresh look at its relations with a continent split between ethnic conflict and zones of economic and political progress . After less than two months in power , Labour ' s Africa policies are not yet in sharp focus but a stronger emphasis on the link between human rights , good governance and prosperity seems to be one of them . A test will come in Nigeria , Africa ' s most populous state and a centre for major British investment in oil and trade . The blunt words coming out of London suggest that military ruler General Sani Abacha is in for a rough ride . " Nigeria is a very interesting example of the way in which economic progress and human rights are complementary , " Britain ' s new Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said late last month . " What holds it back is a corrupt regime and very poor standards of democratic government , " he said , opposing Nigeria ' s re - admission to the Commonwealth . Unlike the Conservatives , Labour has signalled its readiness to back biting sanctions against Nigeria to add pressure for democracy . If the threat is converted into action , Nigeria ' s isolation will increase sharply but so will the risk to Britain ' s economic stake in the country . In a weekend interview , Cook ' s deputy for Africa , Tony Lloyd , repeated the strong message to Nigeria and told military putschists in Sierra Leone , Britain ' s first African colony but economically a lightweight , that " the game is up " . " We don ' t really regard the issues of economic progress and civil progress as being divisible . " We do firmly believe in societies which respect the . . . democratic right of their people to be sovereign and governments which want to make economic progress , " Lloyd told Reuters . " I think the government in Nigeria does have to understand that the position they ' ve put themselves in leaves them outside of the international community , " he said . Lloyd visited South Africa , Kenya and Uganda last week in the first trip to Africa by a new Labour minister . " Too often Africa has been dismissed by Europeans , by North Americans as being a hopeless case . The images are negative ones of violence , of military regimes , of poverty , " he said . With chronic conflict or the threat of anarchy in more than a dozen African countries , pessimists have plenty to buttress their case . But Lloyd said there were " good and hopeful signs " in many other countries . " What modern Britain wants with a Labour government is a mature relationship with the new emerging Africa , " he said . " The message . . . is that we want a proper relationship with Africa , a relationship between equals . " Labour takes office as France , Britain ' s great rival in the 19th century " Scramble for Africa " , watches its post - colonial influence in the continent waning at dramatic speed . Chucked out of Rwanda and Zaire , France is now under threat in the whole of Central Africa and some officials blame an " Anglo - Saxon " plot hatched by the U . S . and Britain . Lloyd said the new left - leaning governments in London and Paris were already talking about a joint approach to promote stability and economic progress in Africa . " The days have gone when Africa could be divided in this arbitrary anglophone versus francophone way . It ' s not good for us , it ' s not good for the French and it ' s not good for Africa . " South Africa and Uganda are widely seen as success stories but the third country on Lloyd ' s tour , Kenya , is a problem for any British government . Britain is Kenya ' s largest foreign investor and still has close military links with its only former colony outside southern Africa which attracted permanent British settlers . There is a lot at stake and the previous British government was perceived as resisting the domestic and donor pressure on President Daniel arap Moi to accept full democracy and to respect the human rights of his opponents . Visiting in a period of high political tension , Lloyd did little to suggest a shift in cautious British policy . " There is a huge demand for change . ( But ) what Kenya ' s got to avoid , particularly in the run - up to the imminent general elections , is a resort to violence instead of political debate , " he said , noting Kenya ' s stability and open - door policy towards regional refugees under Moi ' s 19 - year stewardship .

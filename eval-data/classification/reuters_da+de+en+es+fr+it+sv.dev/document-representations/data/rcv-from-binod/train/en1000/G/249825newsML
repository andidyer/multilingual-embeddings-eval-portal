Doctors correct Mother Teresa ' s heartbeat . Doctors said they gave Mother Teresa a mild electric shock on Wednesday to correct her irregular heartbeat . Dr Patricia Aubanel said the procedure was a success , and the 86 - year - old Roman Catholic nun asked afterwards if she could return home from hospital . Doctors had postponed the procedure , called cardioversion , at the weekend so the revered missionary could regain more strength from last month ' s heart surgery . Aubanel , part of an eight - member team treating the 1979 Nobel peace prize winner , said the procedure was successfully carried out at 10 : 30 a . m . ( 0500 GMT ) . " At this point , she is stable and it is hoped that the sinus ( regular ) rhythm will remain , " Aubanel told reporters at Calcutta ' s B . M . Birla Heart Research Centre . Mother Teresa , who has had three heart operations in five years , last underwent cardioversion in August . " Is it over ? Did it work ? " Aubanel quoted Mother Teresa as asking immediately after the cardioversion . When she was told it was a success , Mother Teresa said : " Wonderful . Let us go home now . "

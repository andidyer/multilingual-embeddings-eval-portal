Belgian child sex search finds two bodies . Police searching a property owned by Marc Dutroux , chief suspect in Belgium ' s child sex abuse and murder scandal , on Tuesday found the decomposing bodies of two adolescents or adults , a medical source said . " They have found two bodies in an advanced state of decomposition , " the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity . There was no immediate official comment , but Belga news agency cited a judicial source as saying the remains of at least two people had been found . Police earlier said they had found what appeared to be human remains without giving any further details . " We discovered bones , probably of a human nature , " Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean - Marie Boudin told reporters outside the house in the Charleroi suburb of Jumet , formerly occupied by Dutroux associate Bernard Weinstein . Dutroux has said he murdered Weinstein and also admitted kidnapping An Marchal , 17 , and Eefje Lambrecks , 19 , a year ago . The fate of the two girls remains a mystery . Several other Belgian girls have gone missing in recent years . Their files are all now pooled in Neufchateau , nerve centre of an international paedophile hunt . An eight - year - old Zairean girl who went missing in Liege on Monday was found safe on Tuesday . She had run away . Boudin urged reporters not to speculate about the identity of the remains , saying : " We don ' t know " . Police have been digging around the Jumet house , one of six owned by Dutroux in or near Charleroi , for the past week . The bones were found underneath a shed in the garden . Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet , leading the hunt for a paedophile sex gang and its victims , visited the site , as did police pathologist Jean - Pol Beauthiez . Boudin said searches were suspended from the moment the bones were found . He said they would resume later in the afternoon . The find follows discovery of the bodies of two eight - year - old children and that of Weinstein on August 17 at a house owned by Dutroux in Sars - La - Buissiere , south of Charleroi . Dutroux said the two girls , Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , starved to death earlier this year , some nine months after being abducted . Two other girls , Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne , were rescued from another of Dutroux ' s houses 12 days ago . Both had been sexually abused . No remains had been found previously at the house in Jumet . The discovery of the paedophile web has horrified the country , prompted the government to tighten rules on early release of sex offenders and triggered calls for a global war against the child sex trade . The fact that Dutroux was released early from a 13 - year sentence for child rape , and that he has fathered three children by his two wives , has bewildered adults and children alike . The hunt for missing girls has taken on international dimensions . Belgian police have visited Slovakia and the Czech Republic and have contacted colleagues in Austria and Germany . Authorities in Bratislava suspect Dutroux of the murder of a Slovak woman and the planned kidnapping of at least one other . Nine people are now under arrest in the Belgian affair , including Dutroux ' s second wife Michelle Martin . Police have found trench - like cells allegedly for holding kidnapped children in one of Dutroux ' s houses and seized more than 300 paedophile porn video tapes - - some featuring Dutroux himself - - plus magazines , childrens clothing and a gun .

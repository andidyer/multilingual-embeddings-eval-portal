Romania views foreign flows as key to reforms . President Emil Constantinescu on Wednesday said Romania had to boost paltry foreign capital inflows to ensure the success of its market reforms . " Capital shortages make it impossible to fulfil any reform process , " Constantinescu told a conference on investment according to a text received by Reuters . " It is no secret that the Romanian economy , like the economies of all post - communist states , faces capital shortages . " Romania ' s centrist government , elected last November , has pledged to speed up the sluggish reforms of seven years of leftist rule following the December 1989 fall of communism . It is committed to speeding up privatisation , restructuring capital markets and providing incentives for foreign investors . The new government ' s programme has won praise and financial pledges from international lenders , with the International Monetary Fund extending a $ 430 million stand - by credit and the World Bank approving more than $ 700 in loans . The IMF ' s representative in Bucharest said the programme had started to bear fruit , with inflation reduced and the central bank ' s foreign reserves on the rise . " There are clear indications that the Romanian economy has begun to stabilise , " John Hill told the conference . " We believe therefore that the government ' s programme deserves broad support , both at home and abroad . " After hitting 30 . 7 percent in March , monthly inflation slowed to 4 . 3 percent last month and is to fall to two percent by year - end . Central bank foreign exchange reserves rose to $ 1 . 65 billion at end - May from February ' s $ 697 . 4 million . Constantinescu said Romania had to take advantage of its favourable geographic position , skilled labour force and newfound political stability to bring in investment . " The economic restructuring programme has proved viable . . . we have had positive developments in restructuring , privatisation , macro - economic stability and promotion of a new fiscal policy , " he said . " Romania boasts guarantees of political stability . . . and there are other advantages which make our country a privileged investment area . " Foreign investment since 1989 has been thin compared to other countries in the region , standing at $ 2 . 3 billion at the end of last year . Investors blame their reluctance on red tape , inadequate legislation and corruption . A recent government decree on foreign investment grants incentives , including lower profit taxes and customs duties and exemptions . It also introduces rules on portfolio deals . New portfolio rules produced quick results . Foreigners rushed into Romanian equities , boosting volumes and turnover on the Bucharest stock exchange and the over - the - counter market . Legislation allowing foreign ownership of land removed another stumbling block .

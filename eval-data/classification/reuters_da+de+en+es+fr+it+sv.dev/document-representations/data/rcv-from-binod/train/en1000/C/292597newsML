France may back C . Lyonnais capital injection - paper . The French finance ministry is coming round to the idea of providing a 12 billion franc recapitalisation being sought by state bank Credit Lyonnais , the daily Liberation said on Tuesday . But it wanted to ensure the recapitalisation would be last for the bank , and would spread out the payments over time due to state budget constraints . The aim would be to try to privatise Credit Lyonnais in 1998 . Finance ministry officials were not immediately available for comment . The newspaper noted that the European Commmission , which must approve such state aid , was far from being convinced that Credit Lyonnais was doing everything it could itself to improve profitability . It noted that Credit Lyonnais , in return for European Commission acceptance of a previous rescue plan , had pledged to reduce its European operations by 50 percent . By the end of 1996 , Credit Lyonnais had reduced its European operations by just 21 percent . " But to go further would be to sign its death warrant , " the newspaper said . Many Credit Lyonnais subsidiaries were bought at a high price and the bank would register capital losses if it sold them now . It would show a capital loss of nearly five billion francs if it were to sell its stake in German bank BfG Bank AG , Liberation said . It noted that bank chairman Jean Peyrelevade aimed to improve profitability by cutting 5 , 000 jobs between now and the end of 1998 , and by more selective lending . - - Paris Newsroom + 33 1 42 21 53 81

FORECAST - Clarke to resist further UK rate cuts . British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will resist a strong temptation to cut interest rates when he meets Bank of England governor Eddie George on Wednesday , say UK economists polled by Reuters . Thirteen out of 20 economists surveyed said the Chancellor would heed the governor ' s advice and hold base rate at 5 . 75 percent , particularly after data released on Monday pointed to stronger manufacturing and buoyant monetary growth . " Today ' s Purchasing Manager ' s survey and M0 numbers fit with the view that there ' s clearly a pretty strong , sustainable consumer recovery underway , " said Ian Stewart , UK economist at Merrill Lynch . August ' s PMI came in at 51 . 8 , the highest level in a year . This , along with upbeat evidence from the CBI and British Chamber of Commerce , knocked the argument that rates should be cut in order to drag manufacturing out of the doldrums , said Stewart . Economists also noted Clarke would be reluctant to incur the wrath of the hawkish Bank of England governor . " Diplomatically , for Clarke ' s ongoing relationship with the governor , pushing for another cut so soon after two that Eddie George disagreed with isn ' t likley to be that easy , " said Ian Williams , economist at Panmure Gordon . And with consumer spending finally feeding through to the rest of the economy , Clarke would not want to run the risk of having to hike rates later in the year . " Although Clarke would dearly love to reduce base rates , the economic background that he faces would be against that , and he wouldn ' t want to reduce base rates now and end up being forced to raise them nearer the time of a general election , " said Andy Cates , UK economist at UBS . But most economists stressed that their predictions were finely balanced and seven reckoned Clarke would grab the opportunity to slip in a final rate cut before the UK election , which must be held by the spring of 1997 . " He ' ll want to make sure that any cut he makes has time to actually be felt in the real economy before the election , so it argues for a cut sooner rather than later , " said Brian Hilliard , senior international economists at Societe Generale . Economists said still - sluggish manufacturing , poor retail sales in July , slower M4 growth and continued evidence of destocking could give Clarke ammunition to knock 25 basis points off the base rate . " In terms of his own criteria , Clarke has as much reason to cut this month as he did last time in June , " said Hilliard . Clarke may have had an early look at manufacturing output figures , due for release on Friday , economists said . " Manufacturing data is still quite soft and Clarke will be watching the numbers quite closely . If it ( manufacturing ) is still pretty flat , he could use that to hang a rate cut on , " said Panmure ' s Williams . In a separate Reuters poll , manufacturing output is forecast to come in at + 0 . 3 percent for July giving a year - on - year growth of 0 . 1 percent . Detailed results of the survey are as follows : 1 . Will the Chancellor cut interest rates after the monetary meeting on September 4 ? YES : 7 NO : 132 . If Yes , by how much ? 25 basis points . 3 . If Yes , is this the last cut of the cycle ? YES : 6 NO : 14 . If there is no rate cut , is the next move upwards ? YES : 12 NO : 1 - - London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 7958

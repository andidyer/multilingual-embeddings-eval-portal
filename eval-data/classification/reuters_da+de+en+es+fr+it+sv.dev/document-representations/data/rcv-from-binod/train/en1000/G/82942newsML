Sweden may send Palme investigator to South Africa . Sweden said on Friday it may send detectives to South Africa to interview a man who has said an apartheid police spy was behind the assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme 10 years ago . Acting state prosecutor and Palme murder investigation leader Solveig Riberdahl told Reuters : " It might mean sending a member of the Palme commission or a police representative ( to South Africa ) . " It ' s hard to make any proper evaluation of this information in the first place , but the fact that de Kock is the former head of the South African security forces lends a different type of credibility to his story , " she said . " Of course , our own interview would be desirable , but we have very little experience of judicial coooperation with South Africa , " she added . South Africa has pledged a full investigation of court testimony on Thursday by Eugene de Kock , former head of a now disbanded police hit squad , that former spy Craig Williamson was involved in the 1986 murder .

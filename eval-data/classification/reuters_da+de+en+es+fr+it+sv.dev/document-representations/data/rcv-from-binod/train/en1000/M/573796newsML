Thai stocks seen falling on economy , finance woes . Thai stocks are seen declining further on Friday despite a 7 . 1 percent fall in the market over the last four trading session that may be beginning to unearth value in some key stocks , analysts said . The SET Index finished 12 . 51 points lower on Thursday to a new 5 1 / 2 year low of 614 . 06 in turnover worth 3 . 58 billion baht . The SET 50 lost 0 . 94 points to 45 . 02 . " The trend is declining . . . what they ( investors ) are looking for is an economic recovery , and there are still dangers in the finance sector , " said Thanison Dejthamrong , head of research at Kiatnakin Finance and Securities . Finance sector stocks have been hit hard in recent sessions on renewed concerns about loan quality , liquidity , poor earnings prospects and the unsteady progress made on mergers . Doubts surrounding Thai Danu Bank and Finance One ' s merger process were also weighing on sentiment . " I think the rumours are having a sentimental effect at the moment , " Thanison said . A preliminary release of export data on Thursday which showed a five percent rise in April exports versus the same month last year was unlikely to affect the market , traders said . Some recent uncordinated releases of economic data , and poor dissemination of figures from different government agencies , had led to some market confusion surrounding exports , traders said . " The first quarter figures weren ' t good so you wonder what ' s going on . What counts is the year end target and achieving that looks difficult , " said one local trader . The central bank projects export growth of 7 . 7 percent this year . The recent decline in the market may be beginning to unearth some renewed value in selected bank stocks as long term buys and may insulate the market from steep falls , analysts said . - - James Mclean ( 662 ) 652 - 0642

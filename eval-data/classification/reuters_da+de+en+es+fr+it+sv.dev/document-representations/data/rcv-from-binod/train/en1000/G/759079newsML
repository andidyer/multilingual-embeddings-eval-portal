CRICKET - AUSTRALIA ON VERGE OF VICTORY OVER ENGLAND . Australia moved to within one wicket of victory in the fourth test at Headingley on Monday by capturing five English wickets before lunch on the final day . At the interval England were 268 for nine , still needing 61 to make Australia bat again . Only tail - enders Robert Croft ( five not out ) and Mike Smith ( four not out ) stood between the tourists and a two - one lead in the Ashes series with two tests to play . There was enough cloud on a breezy morning to help the bowlers but not enough to bring the rain that England desperately wanted to assist their struggle for survival . The fifth - wicket partnership between Nasser Hussain and John Crawley that had occupied the whole of the final session on Sunday lasted for just five more overs . It had reached 133 when Hussain miss - drove Shane Warne straight to Jason Gillespie at mid - off . Hussain , who had completed an outstanding century just before the close the previous evening , finished with 105 in a little over four hours . Gillespie then replaced Glenn McGrath and took the new ball in tandem with Paul Reiffel . The first ball with it shot through low , emphasising the hazards of batting . Not surprisingly , it was the slowest period of the match , with only 40 runs coming from the first 20 overs of the day . In the next one Mark Ealham , on four , played Reiffel towards the slips and Mark Waugh took a fine catch to his right . Four overs later Reiffel struck a critical blow by bowling Crawley between his bat and pad for 72 . He followed that up by snaring Dean Headley leg before wicket for three and Gillespie then saw off Darren Gough first ball , also caught by Mark Waugh . Any lingering hope England might have had of surviving the day had disappeared with the loss of four wickets in seven overs .

Albright expected to press activist U . S . role . After days of rigorous preparation , Madeleine Albright faced her confirmation hearing on Wednesday to become first female U . S . secretary of state and was expected to call for a " new engagement " by the United States in the world . " She wants to see the United States play a strong role in the world and wants to get a new engagement out of the Congress to do so , " one U . S . official told Reuters . He said she would " try to send a clear call for a new engagement by the United States in the world , both in terms of interest on the part of the Congress , the committees and the American people , and the resources needed to achieve those goals . " Albright , who has been U . S . ambassador to the United Nations for the past four years , started studying briefing papers on a wide variety of issues soon after President Bill Clinton nominated her to the top American diplomatic post on Dec 5 . Over the past week she has logged an estimated 20 hours at the State Department facing " murder boards " - - panels of senior officials who quiz her on subjects she likely will be asked about when she goes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday morning . The hearings could last through Thursday . " It ' s a very intensive session , " one senior official said of the " murder - board " process that secretary of state and ambassadorial nominees typically use as practice sessions before their confirmation hearings . Albright has been intimately involved in making U . S . policy toward Iraq , Bosnia and many other subjects during her U . N . tenure and so is conversant on those issues . But she has had to spend time boning up on matters on which she has less expertise , like Asia , economics and the arcane details of non - proliferation . Barring some unforseen turn , there is every expectation Albright , 59 , will win the recommendation of the committee and be confirmed shortly thereafter by the full Senate . She held private individual meetings on Capitol Hill on Tuesday with some members of the 18 - member Senate committee . Senate aides say that despite the fact that she is well - regarded by the committee ' s crusty Chairman Jesse Helms , he and other Republicans intend to press her closely on U . S . foreign policies they either oppose or feel have been inadequately handled during Clinton ' s first term . Albright is " inheriting what Helms believes has been an often disastrous , incoherent and dangerous foreign policy and ( he ) will ask her on a number of fronts whether she plans to continue the status quo or make changes , " one aide said . Although Albright helped engineer the replacement of U . N . Secretary - General Boutros Boutros - Ghali , Helms and other critics need to be persuaded his replacement , Kofi Annan , will undertake fundamental reform of the world body before Congress approves more than $ 1 billion in back dues owed by the United States , Senate aides say . Albright also was expected to be asked her views on a controversial Helms plan to reorganize the U . S . foreign policy bureacracy that includes bringing the Agency for International Development , the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U . S . Information Agency under State Department control . Even some State Department officials believe the adminstration must go along with this plan - - or some variation - - if it wants to win new funding from Congress for the decimated foreign policy budget - - a key goal of Albright . " We ' ve reduced the budget . Now is the time to say , ' Wait a minute . This is an important part of America ' s role and we can ' t do it on the cheap , ' " one administration official said . Russia , Cuba and the administration ' s decision to turn a blind eye to Iranian arms shipments to Bosnian Moslems are among other topics expected to be raised by Republicans . Helms for one is angered that Clinton recently waived a key part of a tough anti - Cuba sanctions law and insists that another key section also is not being vigorously enforced .

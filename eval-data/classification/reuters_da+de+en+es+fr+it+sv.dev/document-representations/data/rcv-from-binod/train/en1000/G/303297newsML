Spanish police have arrested the alleged kingpin of the so - called " Y Groups " , violent youth groups with links to Basque separatist guerrillas ETA , the government ' s delegate to the Navarre region said on Monday . Joseba Miren Saenz , 49 , known as " The Grandfather " , was arrested and imprisoned on Friday along with a 20 - year - old who was released on bail . Police say Saenz is responsible for recruiting and training youths linked to ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) , which has killed some 800 people since it started a drive for Basque independence in 1968 . " His arrest is an important success in diminishing support for terrorism , " Francisco Javier Ansuategui , the Navarre government delegate , told a news conference . Police searched Saenz ' s apartment in Pamplona , capital of the northern Navarre region , and seized an " impressive " quantity of material for making firebombs as well as weapons and ammunition . " There are still more of these older people who are manipulating the youths , " he said . " But from what he ( Saenz ) confessed . . . one of the protagonists of this use of young people has been discovered . " The two arrests on Friday come on top of another 13 in Navarre , which is 25 percent Basque , since the beginning of the year . Three youths , two aged 15 , were arrested on Monday for allegedly burning a bus in Pamplona on Sunday . The " Y Groups " were particularly destructive this weekend , police said . Hooded attackers set fire to cars , rubbish bins , telephone booths , bank cash machines and a bookstore . They injured two people in assaults on a truck carrying fish from Pamplona and a Socialist party centre in the Basque Country .

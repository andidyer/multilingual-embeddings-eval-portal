Berlusconi says Albanian shipwreck stains Italy . Albania said on Sunday more than 80 people were feared dead after a shipwreck in the Adriatic , a tragedy that Italian opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi said blackened his country ' s image . Albanian ambassador to Rome Pandeli Pasko told Reuters that he had compiled a list of missing people after talking to survivors in the southern Italian port of Brindisi . His figures put the number of people on the boat at between 120 and 130 . It sank on Friday night after colliding with a navy ship trying to head it away from Italy under orders aimed at stemming a tide of illegal immigrants . Only 34 people were pulled from the water in difficult weather conditions and four bodies were recovered . The Italian navy has called off the search for survivors . " I spoke to all but two of the survivors individually and they told me who was with them , " Pasko said . " We made up a list as best we could . My God , what a tragedy . " A list of names faxed to Reuters by the Albanian embassy referred to 79 missing people , more than half of them women and children with the youngest a one - month - old baby . Refugees told reporters in Brindisi that the woman and children had been below deck to protect them from the cold and had no chance of escaping when the boat capsized . Former prime minister Berlusconi paid a flying visit to Brindisi on Sunday and met some of the survivors . " We must wash out this stain , which may have been due to misfortune but certainly derived from a decision that should not have been made , " he told reporters in the port . " The Italian mission is urgent , necessary , must not be delayed and must take into account this episode which throws a dark and ominous shadow over our international image . " The incident has provoked Tirana ' s anger and came at a delicate time for Italy , prime mover of a force of police or troops intended to protect food and medical supplies in Albania . Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Sunday he hoped the Italian - led mission , authorised by the U . N . Security Council and the Albanian government , would start very soon . " I hope that the mission can leave immediately because Italy has been ready since March 17 - 18 , " he said on a visit to a refugee camp near his home town of Bologna . Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper that several days at least were needed . Italy has warned its nationals in southern Albania to limit their stays but newspapers quoted Albanian President Sali Berisha saying the Italians would be well received . Dini told La Stampa that the tragedy was an accident that could not have been easily avoided . " Our navy had the task of stopping boats bringing illegal immigrants to Italy and the Albanian boat did not stop . " It tried in every way to evade the two Italian ships and then , after several risky manouevres , set itself on a collision course with our vessel that could not avoid it . " Some of the refugees have been quoted as saying that the Italian ship bore down on them and two enquiries have been opened in Italy to investigate the causes . Dini said that Italy was not denying anyone ' s right to asylum but most of the 13 , 000 Albanians who have flooded into the country in recent weeks were not real refugees . " What is happening in Albania is the illegal immigration to Italy of people who do not need asylum and who are not seeking asylum . They merely want to cross the borders of the European Union in order to get work , " he said . " Our government ' s action is right , carefully thought out and balanced . And we have no intention of changing it . "

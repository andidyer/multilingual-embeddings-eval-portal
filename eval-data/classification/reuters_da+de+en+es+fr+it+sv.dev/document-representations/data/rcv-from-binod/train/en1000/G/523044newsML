Rugby Union - ACT back on top of Super 12 table . ACT Brumbies returned to the top of the Super 12 rugby standings on Friday with a hard fought 15 - 9 win over the Otago Highlanders in bitterly cold conditions in Invercargill . The Brumbies , who moved one point ahead of the Auckland Blues , were inspired to their fifth win in eight matches by former Wallaby halfback George Gregan . However , their place at the top of the points table may be shortlived as Auckland play fourth - placed Gauteng Lions in Auckland on Satursday . ACT fully deserved their win , displaying superior control to the Highlanders , who kicked away possession and committed many handling errors . Gregan played a commanding role for ACT , scoring a try and setting up another for blindside flanker Owen Finnegan . Gregan successfully probed the blindside to score the first try in the 21st minute to help his side to an 8 - 3 halftime lead . ACT wasted no time in extending their advantage after the interval when Finnegan scored under the posts just 90 seconds into the half after accepting an inside pass from Gregan . David Knox ' s simple conversion lifted the Australian side to a commanding 15 - 3 lead before penalties from Tony Brown closed the gap to six points , giving Otago a consolation bonus point . Scorers : Otago - Penalties : Tony Brown ( 3 ) . ACT - Tries : George Gregan , Owen Finnegan ; Penalty : David Knox . Conversion : Knox .

Iranian protesters hurl eggs at German embassy . About 5 , 000 Iranian students marched to Germany ' s embassy in Tehran on Sunday to protest against accusations by a German prosecutor that Iran ordered the killings of Kurdish dissidents in Bonn . Demonstrators threw eggs and tomatoes at the embassy and more than 100 police including about two dozen riot police repelled several attempts by a dozen angry protesters to surge through their lines around the compound . Police apparently made no arrests . The students , chanting " Death to fascist Germany " and " Death to pro - America Germany " , had marched from the mosque at Tehran university after midday prayers . " If it was not for our respect of the police , we would have entered the embassy and pulled down the German flag , " a rally organiser said over a loudspeaker . Iran has been engaged in a war of words with Germany since a German prosecutor last week accused Iranian leaders of ordering the deaths of three senior Kurdish opposition figures and their translator at a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . Tehran has denied any role in the killings and protested on Thursday to Bonn over the charges . German prosecutors on Friday demanded life sentences for an Iranian and a Lebanese for the slayings .

Merged Abitibi chooses Montreal for head office . The company formed by the planned C $ 4 . 1 billion ( $ 3 . 1 billion ) merger of Abitibi - Price Inc . and Stone - Consolidated Corp . said on Monday its head office will be in Montreal rather than Toronto . The decision by executives from the two companies was politically sensitive because Montreal has lost dozens of big company head offices to Toronto and other Canadian cities over the last 20 years . The premiers of both the French - speaking province of Quebec and English - speaking Ontario lobbied the two companies over the head office selection . Stone - Consolidated , which is 47 percent owned by Stone Container Corp . , of Chicago , has about 185 employees at its head office in Montreal . Abitibi - Price has about 225 employees at its headquarters in Toronto . Stone Container will own 25 percent of the merged company , which tentatively has been named Abitibi - Consolidated . The two companies are set to merge in the second quarter of this year in an all - stock swap that will create the world ' s largest newsprint maker by a two - to - one margin . Of Abitibi - Consolidated ' s 18 paper mills , eight are based in Quebec , where it also has seven sawmills and signficant timber cutting rights granted by the province . Montreal was chosen for business reasons , Abitibi - Price Chairman Ron Oberlander , who will become chairman of Abitibi - Consolidated , said in a statement . " Both the Ontario and Quebec governments put forward strong cases on behalf of the two cities . Naturally , we are aware of the political sensitivities that attend any head office decision , " Oberlander said . Among other things , office operating costs are 10 percent lower in Montreal than Toronto , and Montreal is the executive center of the forest products industry in eastern Canada , the companies said . Abitibi - Consolidated ' s decision was good news for Montreal , which has lost dozens of head offices since the separatist Parti Quebecois took power in 1976 .

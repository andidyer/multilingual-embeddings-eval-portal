PHILIPS CABLE SALE WOULD BE WELCOMED . Any move by Philips Electronics NV to sell its cable television activities would fit in with new chairman Cor Boonstra ' s profit - enhancing aims , although finding buyers could be a problem , analysts said on Thursday . Philips earlier said a sale or bourse flotation of its cable interests were " logical " options as it undertook a review of its non - performing businesses promised by Boonstra . " From a financial point of view , yes this would be a positive move . From a strategic point of view it ' s not entirely clear , " said Van Meer James Capel analyst Joost van Beek . A report in Dutch daily De Volkskrant that Philips wanted to shed its cable TV operations , part of the loss - making Philips Media group , prompted Philips to say that its position over the actitivies had not changed . " There ' s nothing new happening , " said a Philips spokeswoman earlier . " We said at the third quarter results ( in October ) we would look at non - performing assets and of course we ' re looking over the portfolio of the media unit . " Boonstra , who took over as Philips chairman from Jan Timmer in October , drew plaudits from analysts and investors when he told reporters he was going to deal with the firm ' s " bleeders " . " I will also take head on what I call the bleeders in the company , that means we will turn around , sell or close businesses that are not performing to our standards or are not fitting into our portfolio , " he said late in October . " Any sale would fit perfectly into the strategy defined by Cor Boonstra to stop the bleeders . It ' s obvious in cable TV you have to invest heavily in order to build up interactive services , two way communication and so on , " said Van Beek . But analysts said impending changes in the Netherlands meant that a potential candidate for the interests , Koninklijke PTT Nederland , could be thinning its own cable interests . KPN and the government last month agreed that one condition for 77 percent - owned KPN cable unit Casema to qualify for regional infrastructure licences was a cut by KPN in its Casema stake to a minority . " We used to have a situation where there was a big scarcity and a large demand for cable TV , it may look like there ' s going to be some supply both from Philips and KPN , " said Van Beek . Steven Vrolijk of securities house ING Barings said the fragmented nature of Philips ' cable interests , plugged into the UPC joint venture with U . S . cable television firm United International , could also obstruct a potential buyer . " I don ' t know who would be interested in buying . It has stakes everywhere but not one big franchise , so I don ' t know who is in that market , " said Vrolijk . " The hype which surrounds cable TV networks and their potential for telephony and value added services could be reaching its end and people are becoming more and more aware of the high costs involved and that money is only made in the really long term , " he added . Other analysts saw diminishing appetite for cable firms from telecoms companies . " Until recently telcos were very much interested but maybe they have learned their lessons , " said one . Analysts shied away from putting a value on the interests , which some have said was worth around 1 . 2 billion guilders ( $ 692 million ) . The UPC joint venture is the biggest privately held cable firm in Europe with over two million connections and operations in 16 countries . " Will it will mean a book loss or profit ? For sure some of the cable tv networks like in Vienna or Belgium have been owned by Philips for a number of years , so surely they will make a book profit on that , but on the latest acquisitions I don ' t know , " said Van Beek . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

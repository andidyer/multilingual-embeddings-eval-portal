Conceptus signs letter to acquire Microgyn . Conceptus Inc said Monday it has signed a letter of intent to acquire Microgyn Inc , a private medical device company that has developed products associated with therapeutic hysteroscopy . Financial details were undisclosed , but Conceptus said it will use cash and stock to fund the acquisition . Conceptus shares were up 1 / 2 to 14 - 1 / 2 by mid - morning . Therapeutic hysteroscopy is one of the most rapidly growing procedures in gynecology to treat uterine disorders such as recurrent pregnancy loss , dysfunctional uterine bleeding and pelvic pain , Conceptus said in a statement . The procedure often provides a less - invasive alternative to hysterectomy , or the removal of the uterus , which is performed about 600 , 000 times each year in the United States . Microgyn ' s lead product , Continuous - flow Isotonic Solution System , permits the use of isotonic , or physiologic , fluids during hysteroscopic procedures . Generally procedures require hypotonic fluids , which when absorbed can lead to a number of clinical complications , including death , Conceptus said . . Microgyn filed a 510 ( k ) application for the system in June 1996 . Microgyn is also developing other related products .

Major says British troops could be sent to Zaire . British Prime Minister John Major said on Friday " it is certainly possible " that British troops could be sent to Zaire to aid humanitarian relief . Major , speaking to BBC Radio at an Anglo - French summit in Bordeaux , said it was not yet certain that was the right thing to do but he added : " I don ' t rule that out . " France has proposed a multinational force to avert a disaster among one million refugees displaced by fighting in Zaire . Britain has up to now been non - commital on the plan . France insists all major nations must join the force , which would help to get relief to refugees in eastern Zaire left without food by the fighting between Zairean troops and Rwandan - backed Tutsi rebels . Asked if he was prepared to send British troops in , Major said : " It is certainly possible . It is not yet certain that is the right thing to do . Clearly it would be desirable if there was a large contingent of African troops . " " I have no doubt that Britain may be involved in some way , whether it is logistic support , whether it is financial support , whether possibly even it is troop support . I don ' t rule that out . We would certainly be prepared to play our part . " But he stressed : " You can ' t just send troops into the region without the consent of the people who live in the region . So I think we have to approach this in the proper manner . " French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette has accused the international community of being spineless , venting French frustration at poor response to the Paris suggestion of a multinational force which was endorsed at an African summit in Nairobi on Tuesday . Major said he would be discussing the issue with France at the bilateral talks in Bordeaux . " I know it is frustrating . I know it needs to be done speedily , I hope it will be and that is one of the matters we will discuss this morning , " he said .

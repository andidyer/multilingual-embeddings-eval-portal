LIFFE coffee futures picked up a further 5 . 5 percent intraday gain on Thursday after producers agreed to trim world exports by at least one million 60 - kg bags . But prices retraced to finish off day ' s peaks as profit - taking asfter the sharp rises set in . Benchmark March whizzed past the $ 1 , 600 barrier for the first time since early September to touch a high of $ 1 , 630 a tonne . It then closed at $ 1 , 570 , still a $ 25 rise . Traders said scale - up roaster buying at the lows helped support values . New York arabica futures prices also surged , widening the March / May differential to London to 68 U . S . cents a lb from 60 cents recently . The Ugandan Trade and Industry Minister told Reuters prior to the Association of Coffee Producing Countries ( ACPC ) meeting in Brazil on Thursday that members had agreed on a minimum cut . " There will be a cut . We have already agreed on a minimum . All we are trying to do today is improve the minimum , " Abel Rwendeire said . Traders said the market attracted brisk trade and industry buying this morning . " There was just a general lack of selling above the market . . . The ACPC statement made the market rally higher , " said one . " People are just reluctant to sell the market now . . . certainly they are not going to go short because it is very difficult now to try to pick the top the whole time , " he added . A spate of friendly news including lower Brazilian crops , strike - related cut in Colombian exports and earlier hopes of Vietnam joining the ACPC export programme had helped fuel the current rally . The Ugandan minister , said that the minimum cut was not less than one million 60 - kg bags and involved arabica and robusta cuts , although mainly robustas . Today , observers at the meeting said the final reduction may be nearer to 1 . 5 million , including 500 , 000 bags of arabica split between Brazil and Colombia . African growers had earlier said they want a 2 . 5 million bag cut in ACPC exports between January and June this year , which under a plan agreed in May last year should not exceed 26 . 28 million bags , to rein in much higher prices . While the cut was not unexpected , traders said they were waiting to see how the quota is split among the 15 ACPC members . " The allocation is interesting because arabicas don ' t need any reduction , there ' s already a shortage , " said one . " So we will be very surprised if anyone agrees to an arabica reduction as well . " - - Jalil Hamid , London newsroom + 44 171 542 4985

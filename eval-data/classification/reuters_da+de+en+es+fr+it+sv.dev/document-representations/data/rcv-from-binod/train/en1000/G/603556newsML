Burma arrests at least 50 opposition members . At least 50 senior members of Aung San Suu Kyi ' s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party have been arrested by Burma ' s military government , a senior NLD official said on Wednesday . " Our members of parliament ( MPs ) and some of our members are being arrested ahead of the ( May ) 27th election anniversary , " the NLD official told Reuters from Rangoon . He said the NLD had heard that at least 50 elected MPs or NLD organisers had been detained over the past few days as they headed to the capital to participate in a celebration commemorating the 1990 electoral victory of the party . He said the NLD expected to hear of more arrests in the next few days . The NLD won a landslide victory in May 27 , 1990 elections but the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) never recognised the result of the poll . Last May about 261 elected MPs and senior members of the NLD were detained by the government on their way to attend a party congress timed to coincide with the anniversary of the 1990 election win . The NLD official said about 200 MPs had been invited to the celebration this year , and about 100 senior NLD party members were also expected to attend . " Some of those who were about to leave for Rangoon were detained and not allowed to come , " he said . " In the Karen State , MPs were asked by the authorities not to move from their houses . They are using different ways to stop them from coming . " He said other MPs reported they were followed on a bus from their homes in northern Burma , and once they arrived in Rangoon were told to return home or they would be arrested . Government officials were not immediately available for comment on the arrests . Last May the SLORC said it had only detained the NLD members for questioning and said it was holding them temporarily in order to avoid anarchy . It later released most of them although some were charged and given long prison sentences . The May meeting last year was to be the first time all elected members of parliament were due to meet Suu Kyi since she was released from six years of house arrest in July 1995 . In September another attempt by the NLD to hold a party congress was thwarted by the SLORC , which arrested up to 800 NLD members and supporters and set up armed barricades to prevent access to Suu Kyi ' s house , where the meeting was to be held . The latest series of arrests comes one day after U . S . President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on Burma . The United States is the fourth largest investor in Burma . Clinton , who announced the sanctions last month , officially imposed the ban on all new U . S . investment in Burma on Tuesday , citing " severe repression " in the country . The United States and many Western nations have criticised Burma ' s military rulers of human rights abuses and for failing to recognise the election of the NLD .

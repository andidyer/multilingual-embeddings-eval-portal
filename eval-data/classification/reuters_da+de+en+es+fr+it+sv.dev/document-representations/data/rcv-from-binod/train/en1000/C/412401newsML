Mazda mulls consolidation of North American units . Japan ' s Mazda Motor Corp announced on Friday that it was considering consolidating its five North American subsidiaries , a move which the company said would help reduce costs . A Mazda spokesman said the Japanese car maker , which is one - third owned by Ford Motor Co , was not considering cutting jobs in its North American subsidiaries for now . The company also announced that Richard N . Beattie , an executive director of Americas and Worldwide Export operations , was being appointed to direct efforts to strengthen Mazda ' s position in the North American market . The appointment will take effect on March 1 1997 . Previously , Beattie , 42 , was executive director of Ford ' s rental , lease and remarketing operations and prior to that he was vice president of U . S . sales and marketing for Jaguar . The decision was made under the leadership of Ford ' s Henry Wallace who heads the troubled Japanese car maker . Wallace said in the statement that the new North American chief ' s initial responsibility will be to create a strategic plan for integrating Mazda ' s five units in the area . " Our goal is to increase market share in North America while achieving a higher level of operational efficiency , " Wallace said in the statement . " This means we ' ll be focusing on improving Mazda ' s customer services , strengthening our U . S . and Canadian dealer networks and enhancing our overall marketing capabilities . Richard ' s extensive international experience was key to our naming him to head up this important position , " he said . Mazda said Beattie will report directly to Wallace and will be based at Mazda Motor of America headquarters in California . The Mazda spokesman told Reuters that the company ' s poor business performance in North America was behind the decision . He said the company may consolidate its three sales units in the area . But he flatly denied a report by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun on Friday that Mazda plans to cut about 20 percent of the 1 , 500 workers at its units in the United States and Canada in the aftermath of its planned restructuring . " We are not considering any reduction in labour force ( in the North American units ) as reported earlier . There will be no such job cuts , " he said , when asked about the report . He also denied that Mazda would transfer some of its North American operations to Ford , which was also reported in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun article . Ford ' s already strong grip on the Japanese car marker would be strengthened further after the Ford executive takes the helm of Mazda ' s North American operations . Mazda ' s long - standing ties with Ford intensified last year when Wallace , a Ford official seconded to Mazda , took over as president at the Japanese carmaker , setting himself the task of steering the troubled firm back to prosperity . Ford increased its stake in Mazda to one - third from 24 . 54 percent last April , giving it management control . A few months later Wallace took the wheel , becoming the first foreigner to head a major Japanese firm . Mazda posted a parent current profit of 2 . 08 billion yen in the six months to September 30 , 1996 after a string of losses . Current profit includes losses or gains on investments . It expects its parent current profit to rise to 11 billion yen in the current business year , which ends in March , from 1 . 23 billion yen in 1995 / 96 - - thanks to sales of securities and cost - cutting . In December , Mazda predicted its Japanese vehicle sales would rise 7 . 8 percent to 365 , 000 vehicles in calendar 1997 from the previous year and that its vehicle exports from Japan would rise 1 . 4 percent to 460 , 000 units , after a projected 3 . 0 percent rise in 1996 .

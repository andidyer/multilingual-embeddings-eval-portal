HUNGARY ' S MHB TO TAP FOREIGN MARKETS FOR $ 50 MLN . Hungary ' s Magyar Hitel Bank Rt ( MHB ) said on Friday that it signed an agreement today to take out a $ 50 million loan from a banking consortium led by Fuji Bank Ltd , Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland . " MHB wishes to expand the mid - term loans it gives to its corporate clients and to step up its competitiveness in mid - term financing , " MHB said in a statement . The five - year loan which bears interest of 0 . 9 percentage points above LIBOR , is to be repaid in one instalment , it said . The amount was oversubscribed by $ 36 million , MHB said , but added that the amount it finally tapped was according to its original business plans . The lending conditions were finalised before MHB mandated the banks on May 23 to organise the syndicate and they were thus not influenced by expectations of MHB ' s privatisation . The Hungarian government decided to offer an 89 percent stake in MHB to strategic investors and intends to complete the sale by the end of the year . The other members of the consortium are Bank Austria , GiroCredit Bank , Creditanstalt Bankverien , Bayerische Vereinsbank AG , Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG , Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale , DG Bank , Landesbank Schleswig Holstein Girozentrale , Sumitomo Bank Ltd , Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur , Unibank A / S and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA . - - Emese Bartha , Budapest newsroom ( 36 1 ) 266 2410

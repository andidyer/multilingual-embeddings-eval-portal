An after - tax gain of about two cents per share from the sale of LIFO inventory , resulting from a change in raw material requirements , and an after - tax gain of about one cent per share from an investment were largely offset by a restructuring charge associated with the Engelhard - CLAL joint venture of about two cents per share and a non - recurring charge of about one cent per share related to revaluation of petroleum catalyst inventories . There were a number of other items , both positive and negative , in the quarter . The impact of certain year - end accruals were more than offset by an insurance recovery and lower depreciation expense associated with the recent acquisition of Mearl Corporation . Taken together , all these special items resulted in a positive impact in the fourth quarter of about one - half cent per share after tax .

Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri made the suggestion during a debate on the government ' s policy statement . He referred to a decision by a five - nation group monitoring a ceasefire agreement in south Lebanon that Israel was responsible for bombarding Safad al - Batikh village in October , injuring 13 people . The monitoring group , set up to oversee a U . S . - brokered ceasefire that ended a 17 - day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in April , includes representatives of the United States , France , Syria , Lebanon and Israel . " The ( Monitoring Group ' s ) statement on Safad al - Batikh was clear in putting the responsibility on Israel .

Berri is a former civil war militia leader whose Shi ' ite Moslem Amal movement sometimes attacks Israeli forces in south Lebanon . The April ceasefire that the five - nation group monitors bars attacks on or from civilians areas but allows attacks on Israeli troops occupying a south Lebanon border zone and gives both sides the right of self - defence .

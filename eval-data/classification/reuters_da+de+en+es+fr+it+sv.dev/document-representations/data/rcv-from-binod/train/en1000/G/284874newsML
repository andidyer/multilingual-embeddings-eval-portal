Abbas held more than eight hours of talks with Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai that ended early on Thursday to try to clinch a deal under which Israel would hand over 80 percent of Hebron to Palesinian self - rule . " Almost of the issues have been closed . At present there remains one or two issues that will be closed at a meeting between the chairman ( Arafat ) and Bibi ( Netanyahu ) , " Mordechai told reporters after leaving the meeting at the home of the U .

The meeting was held hours after a right - wing religious Israeli soldier opened fire in a crowded Arab market in Hebron , wounding seven Palestinians before being overpowered by other soldiers . Israel and the Palestinians have struggled in three months of U . S . - brokered talks to reach an agreement on Hebron .

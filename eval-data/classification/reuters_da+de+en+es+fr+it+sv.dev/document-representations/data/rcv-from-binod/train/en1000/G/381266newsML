Burma rebel leader blamed for string of defeats . A split appeared to be emerging within the Karen National Union ( KNU ) , Burma ' s biggest rebel group , with senior rebels blaming leader Bo Mya for a string of military defeats and calling for his removal . The apparent split comes as guerrilla sources report that morale in one of the world ' s most enduring rebel groups has plummeted . They said crushing defeats last week have many dismayed rebels quietly conceding that the KNU was finished . The KNU has steadily lost ground in recent years to the military government in Rangoon . " Actually , the KNU was finished three years ago and General Bo Mya should bear full responsibility for that , " a KNU politburo member said . In the latest blows suffered by the rebels , Burmese soldiers overran three key KNU camps last week and attacked a fourth on Friday . The fighting has driven more than 20 , 000 Karen refugees into neighbouring Thailand . Burma on Friday vowed further attacks until all Karen camps were taken . " We will never be revived as long as General Bo Mya is still not dead , " a top KNU official told Reuters , requesting anonymity . He said the hardline Bo Mya , KNU president since 1974 , was to retire after a rebel congress in 1995 and be replaced by vice - president General Shwe Seing , who is regarded as more pragmatic . But the transfer of power never took place . " So the KNU is now left in a very disorderly state . We waited for a couple of years believing the old man might get too old or die and that a second generation would be allowed to carry on the KNU ' s cause and oversee its survival , " he said . Despite dissatisfaction among Bo Mya ' s deputies , the 71 - year - old leader has not been challenged because of his record of executing those questioning his authority , he said . But Colonel Htoo Htoo Lay , KNU vice - secretary , denied the Karen rebellion had been stamped out . " Yes , it is true we have lost all our last footholds but we will continue fighting until the last man like the Palestinians , who did not control any land but fought until Israel gave them back the country . " The predominantly Christian KNU has fought the Burmese military government for greater autonomy for the eastern Karen state since Burma gained independence from Britain in 1948 . During its heyday in the 1980s , it was the biggest of the armed rebel groups fighting Rangoon , controlling more than 40 , 000 guerrillas operating from at least 14 border camps along a 400 km ( 250 mile ) stretch of Burma ' s northeastern border . But since 1992 , Burmese troops gradually gained the upper hand , overrunning several KNU camps . The group faced its biggest setback in January 1995 , when a Buddhist faction mutinied against the KNU ' s Christian - dominated leadership . The Buddhist faction defected to the government and in March 1995 helped Rangoon seize the KNU headquarters at Manerplaw and its last entrenched stronghold at Kawmoora . The top KNU member said moderates in the group had recently started talks on reuniting with the Buddhist splinter group , called the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army ( DKBA ) . " Without him ( Bo Mya ) , we can be reunited with the DKBA and we can seek reasonable bargaining with Burma , " he said , adding that pragmatic KNU members were prepared to negotiate with Rangoon after Bo Mya died or retired . Bo Mya ' s personal secretary denied a rumour that the KNU leader was gravely ill and admitted to a hospital in Bangkok . " I was with him yesterday . He was fit and strong and I don ' t believe he has suffered from sudden illness , " Dr Ma Tha said on Saturday .

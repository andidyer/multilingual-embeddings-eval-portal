HORSE RACING - MR MULLIGAN LANDS STEEPELCHASING CROWN . The 20 - 1 shot Mr Mulligan finally conquered his eratic jumping on Thursday to land the Cheltenham Gold Cup and give champion jockey Tony McCoy a memorable big race double . McCoy , who won Tuesday ' s Champion Hurdle on Make a Stand , stuck like glue to the strapping chestnut who was foot perfect to land steeplechasing ' s most coveted prize . Mr Mulligan stormed up the Cheltenham hill to land the Gold Cup by nine lengths from the 33 - 1 shot Barton Bank with the Irish novice Dorans Pride third at 10 - 1 in the 14 - runner field . Last year ' s winner Imperial Call never looked happy on the lightning fast ground and was pulled up on the last circuit . One Man , a dual King George VI winner who is rated Britain ' s best steeplechaser , ran out of steam coming to the last fence just as he did last year and finished a disappointing sixth . " He has been a nightmare to train but he has a big heart - - that is the most important thing , " said trainer Noel Chance who had a string of injury problems with Mr Mulligan . Chance , who came to train in England from Ireland two years ago , added : " This is brilliant , I struggled for 20 years in Ireland . This is the light at the end of the tunnel . " Mr Mulligan , a spectacular novice last year , clouted the first fence in the 1996 Sun Alliance Chase and returned to the unsaddling enclosure with blood pooring from his legs . The chestnut also tore a ligament when crashing in the King George VI in December when lying second to One Man . McCoy , just back in the saddle after a horrendous fall when he broke his shoulder blade and collarbone , disclosed afterwards he decided only during the last two or three days to ride Mr Mulligan when the going dried out dramaticaly . The soft - spoken Irishman , a non - drinker who celebrated his victory with a glass of orange juice , was in a daze of delight after a memorable week of big race victories which also saw him win the Arkle Trophy on Or Royal . McCoy said that Mr Mulligan made one slight error early in the race . " Then he really warmed to his task . As soon as I gave him a smack going down the hill I knew it would take a good one to get past him . " It was tears and cheers all round when 9 - 1 shot Commanche Court , trained by popular Irishman Ted Walsh and ridden by Norman Williamson , landed the Triumph Hurdle from the 40 - 1 shot Circus Star . Walsh , who rode four winners at Cheltenham as an amateur jockey was given a tumultuous reception after the gutsy win . " I shed a few tears with my four kids around me , I can tell you . I ' m an emotional old git behind it all . I ' ll be living on this for the next 12months , " he told reporters as the cheers rolled around the unsaddling enclosure .

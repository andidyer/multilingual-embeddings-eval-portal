COMEX copper ends sharply up , boosted by stock fall . COMEX copper surged ahead to close at its highest since late June as a combination of a sharp drop in LME stocks and technically - based buying fuelled the heavily - traded advance , traders said . LME stocks fell 13 , 525 tonnes to a total of 145 , 825 tonnes , well below a month ' s global supply . Although the drop was in line with trader expectations , it still encouraged some buying , traders said . " The inventory number this morning was a healthy decline and all indications are that it ' s going to continue to decline , " said Fred Demler of E D and F Man International . Brokers noted that consumer hedge buying helped trigger buy stops which encouraged some speculative buying , but there was also some producer selling on the highs . December COMEX settled 2 . 20 cents firmer at 97 . 15 cents per pound , traded 97 . 25 to 94 . 20 cents . October was up 2 . 10 cents at 101 . 20 cents . Volume was estimated at 16 , 000 lots . Demler said prices have not peaked . " There is a way to go . " Kennecott Utah Copper Corp unions accepted a new six - year labor deal .

British widow wins right to sperm treatment . A British widow claimed victory in a lengthy legal battle by winning the right on Thursday to try to have a baby using her late husband ' s sperm . Britain ' s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) decided to allow Diane Blood , 32 , to export her husband Stephen ' s sperm , frozen since his death , to Belgium for treatment . " It must be right that people should control the destiny of their own genetic material , " said HFEA chairwoman Ruth Deech . Blood was delighted by the outcome of a case that became a cause celebre in Britain . " This is obviously wonderful , wonderful news . I am very , very relieved , " she told a news conference . " I am sure that Stephen would be very happy . " The sperm , being stored in a hospital in northern England , will be taken to Brussels where doctors say they are willing to give her in - vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) treatment . The HFEA initially ruled in November that the sperm could not be used because Stephen Blood had not given his written permission before he died of meningitis in 1995 . The appeal court overturned the ruling earlier this month when three judges said that while insemination would be illegal in Britain , it could be carried out in Belgium . The HFEA , which was then asked to rule that there were no public policy objections before the treatment could be carried out , said it would allow the export of the sperm . " This is the only way to resolve the tragic situation for Mrs Blood , one that will not arise again . It has never been the the HFEA ' s wish to upset her in any way and I ' m sure she understands there were very important principles we had to uphold , " Deech said . " It is now for the clinic storing the sperm to satisfy itself that the clinic in Brussels considers the welfare of any child that may be born . " HFEA officials said Blood would be treated at the Academish Ziekenhuis Universiteit , a part of the Brussels Centre for Reproductive Medicine . The authority said it had always insisted on the principle of written consent and emphasised that " this is an exceptional case which the court assured cannot recur . " In their ruling , the appeal court judges noted that a similar case would not be possible in future because under English law Blood ' s sperm should not have been preserved because he had not given his written permission . Deech said the HFEA deliberated for 90 minutes before reaching its decision , but had already spent " many months , many days , many hours on this . Every angle has been explored . " Under British law , Blood ' s dead husband will not be reagrded as the legal father of any child and there will be a blank space on the birth certificate where the father ' s name should be . " I don ' t imagine that that will be of much practical concern to her , " said Deech .

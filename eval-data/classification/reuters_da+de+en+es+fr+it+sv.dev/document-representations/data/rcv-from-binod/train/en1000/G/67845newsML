Celibacy debate resurfaces with Bishop ' s case . Can the Roman Catholic Church expect its bishops and priests to remain celibate in a fast - lane modern world filled with temptations ? That is the thorny question raised yet again by the case of a Scottish bishop who fathered a child with one woman when he was a priest 15 years ago and disappeared with another , divorced , woman this month . " This is a terrible blow to the Church because an individual in the highest level of responsibility . . . has totally betrayed his trust , " Archbishop John Foley , head of the Vatican ' s communications department , told Reuters Television . The saga of Bishop Roderick Wright is only the latest sex scandal to rock a Church whose bishops and priests Pope John Paul insists must remain chaste . Wright is at least the fifth Catholic bishop to resign in the past six years over acknowledged or alleged affairs . In 1992 Irish Bishop Eamonn Casey also resigned after admitting that he too had fathered a son . The media has made it more difficult for the Church to sweep such cases under the carpet , as they had done for centuries . It is impossible to determine the number of clerics - - many of them often working and living in lonely conditions - - who have violated their chastity vows . Foley said many priests were under " tremendous stress " in modern society . In 1990 , a study said as many as a third of Roman Catholic priests in the United States were sexually active . It was compiled by A . W . Richard Sipe , an ordained Catholic priest and professor at Johns Hopkins University for the book " A Secret World : Sexuality and the Search for Celibacy " . The Roman Catholic Church demands celibacy in order to foster single - minded devotion to God and the ministry . But some Catholics believe that allowing priests to marry - - as is permitted in most other Churches such as the Anglican and Lutheran Churches - - would reduce the risk of sex scandals . " The spate of cases that have emerged over the last few years about priests and bishops in sex relations is another sign that celibacy just doesn ' t work , " said Frances Kissling , president of the Washington - based Catholics for a Free Choice . " Celibacy should be optional . We had married priests for almost the first 1 , 000 years of the Church . Most of the apostles were married , " she told Reuters on Friday . Celibacy is a discipline and not a dogma . Thus , it can be overturned or modified by a future Pope or Church Council . Britain ' s Cardinal Basil Hume said the Church could stop losing many excellent candidates for the priesthood if it relaxed its celibacy ruling . " It is not divine law . It is Church law , so any Pope or General Council could change it , " he told BBC Radio on Tuesday . But Foley , the Vatican archbishop , said : " It is within their power to do so . It is very unlikely that they would . " When the Pope visited the United States last year , Catholic scholar Richard Schoenherr , author of " Full Pews and Empty Altars " , said that unless celibacy is abandoned , there will be too few priests in the 21st Century to minister to Catholics . Joaquin Navarro - Valls , the chief Vatican spokesman , tried to control the fallout from the Wright affair on Friday . " The problem is not whether the Pope thinks celibacy should remain , " said Navarro - Valls , who is travelling with the 76 - year - old Polish Pontiff in France . " It is not a personal doctrine . It is a doctrine of the Church . " In the Bible , Christ refers to " eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven " and St Paul says " he who is unmarried ( can ) care for the things that belong to the Lord " . The earliest formulation of the discipline of celibacy in the Church did not appear until the Council of Elvria , some three centuries after Christ ' s death . The first written universal law making celibacy a must was enacted by the Second Lateran Council in 1139 and the 1563 Council of Trent ruled definitively on the matter .

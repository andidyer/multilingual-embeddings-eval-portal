Dutch Sport7 TV channel ' s losses mount . New Dutch TV channel Sport7 is facing extra losses of 175 million guilders and its shareholders will be asked for extra funding , Sport7 ' s new director said in a newspaper interview on Saturday . " It is sickening . But it is certainly a fact . It is a risk for the owners . The only thing we can do is make our programming better , " newspaper NRC Handelsblad quoted Henk Kivits as saying . The losses are expected to mount as the speciality sports channel has decided it will allow viewers to watch the channel for free until January 1998 , about a year longer than planned . Sport7 has suffered from low viewing figures since it began . In its first full month of operation , September , it gained only a four percent share of the Dutch television audience . In October , that dropped to three percent . Last year , the top nine television audiences in the Netherlands were all for soccer matches featuring the then European champions Ajax Amsterdam or the Dutch national side . In the Hague , Sport7 was withdrawn from the cable service . In Eindhoven and Amsterdam , viewers need to buy a decoder and pay monthly instalments . Much of the Dutch media has also been critical of the quality of its programmes . Kivit is unhappy that in three major cities , Sport7 ' s audience is limited by the cable companies . Unhappy with the channel ' s partial reach , he decided this week to sell the rights to Saturday ' s Netherlands - Wales World Cup qualifying clash to local television stations . " I ' d rather give the game away than have it seen in such a manner , " he says in the NRC Handelsblad interview . In a report last month , ING Barings said Sport7 would post a loss of 102 million guilders for the 1996 / 97 financial year , but would break even in two years time as subscription television gradually took hold in the Netherlands . The key shareholders in Sport7 are PTT Nederland , ING and Dutch TV production firm Endemol ( each with 19 . 5 percent ) . The Dutch football association , KNVB , has a 10 percent stake , power company Nuon seven percent and publisher De Telegraaf five percent . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

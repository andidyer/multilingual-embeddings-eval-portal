Pope speaks out against " dangerous experiments " . Pope John Paul , in an apparent reference to the recent debate on cloning , spoke out on Sunday against all those who abused human dignity with " dangerous experiments " . The Pope , addressing pilgrims before his regular Sunday address at St Peter ' s Basilica , warned of " abuses of all kinds " threatening the dignity of life . " We think , for example , of the lack of respect for life , which is sometimes subjected to dangerous experiments . We think of ecological pollution , the peddling of sex , drug trafficking and the abuse of the poor and of children , " he said . The Vatican last week called for a worldwide ban on human cloning after the creation of a cloned sheep by British scientists caused a furore . The Roman Catholic Church opposes all forms of artificial human conception , including test - tube fertilisation and surrogate motherhood .

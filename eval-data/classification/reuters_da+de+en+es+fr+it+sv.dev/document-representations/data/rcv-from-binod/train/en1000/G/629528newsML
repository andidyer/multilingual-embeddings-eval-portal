Afghan Taleban seek talks with Uzbek commander . Afghanistan ' s Taleban said on Sunday it was seeking talks with ethnic Uzbek leader Abdul Malik , who handed the purist Islamic movement an easy victory in the north last week only to have his followers snatch it away . Taleban considers its pact with General Malik still valid and is holding back from serious attacks on Mazar - i - Sharif , the main city of the north , while it tries to make contact , said a statement distributed in neighbouring Pakistan . Malik has not been heard from since the dramatic reversal of Taleban ' s brief conquest . The Taleban governor of the southern city of Kandahar , Mullah Mohammad Akhund , told reporters on Saturday that Malik had taken no part in his followers ' revolt against the Taleban . Taleban sources say they suspect that Malik , if alive , is held prisoner by other Uzbek commanders . The militia ' s statement , issued in Kandahar and reported by the Pakistan - based Afghan Islamic Press , also reminded Uzbek commanders that Taleban leaders captured in Mazar - i - Sharif had been invited there for talks and should not be harmed . The captives include Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Ghous and military chief for the north Mullah Abdul Razzak . The whirligig sequence of events in the north began when Malik quarrelled with northern warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum , who was Afghanistan ' s most powerful anti - Taleban leader . Malik ' s forces drove Dostum into exile and brought Mazar - i - Sharif under temporary Taleban control last week , but his Uzbek troops and Shi ' ite Moslem militiamen jointly drove Taleban fighters from the city on Wednesday . Taleban said it had so far conducted only limited air and ground attacks against the opposition in Mazar - i - Sharif , but added that a full - scale military operation might be launched if talks failed . On Friday , an Uzbek commander named General Humayun Fauzi warned that any ground or air attack on Mazar - i - Sharif could have " dangerous " consequences for the Taleban prisoners . The Taleban have been rushing reinforcements to their front lines , after being thrown back onto the defensive by their defeat in Mazar - i - Sharif and Friday ' s capture of the key town of Jabal - os - Siraj by opposition guerrilla chief Ahmad Shah Masood . Taleban officials and witnesses said the militia had flown 8 , 000 recruits from Kandahar to Kabul in military transport planes on Saturday and another 1 , 800 on Sunday . Most of the new fighters were Taleban students from Moslem religious schools in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan , who were responding to an appeal for Jihad ( holy war ) made by the Taleban ' s supreme leader , Mullah Mohammad Omar . Some private religious schools in Pakistan closed last week to allow their Afghan students of various ethnic groups , as well as Pakistanis , to join the Taleban in Afghanistan . Long Taleban convoys were seen moving towards Kandahar on Friday and Saturday from the Pakistani city of Quetta . A black - turbaned student , Muhammad Abbas from Gujranwala , in Pakistan ' s Punjab province , told reporters near the border he was heading into Afghanistan to fight the " communists " . Military sources said fighting was continuing around Jabal - os - Siraj , about 70 km ( 56 miles ) north of Kabul , on Sunday , adding that Masood appeared to have the upper hand . Jabal - os - Siraj , on the main road from Kabul to the north , controls access to the Salang Pass across the Hindu Kush mountains and to the Ghorband Valley , where the Taleban are battling a Shi ' ite militia . If it remains in opposition hands , Taleban forces north of the Salang and in the Ghorband Valley are effectively cut off from the Afghan capital .

Croatian currency introduced smoothly in Serb area . Conversion of Yugoslav dinars into the Croatian kuna currency in the Serb enclave of Eastern Slavonia is going smoothly , although less money than expected has been exchanged so far , Croatian media said on Monday . Eastern Slavonia is currently administered by the United Nations but is due to revert to Croatian rule soon . " Some 146 , 000 dinars have been converted by 4pm today , " state news agency HINA quoted executive director of Croatia ' s central bank Adolf Matejka as saying . He said the central bank expected more money would be converted , but added bigger amounts of cash should be exchanged in the next two days , when conversion is to be completed . Croatia ' s central bank has estimated the total amount of Yugoslav dinars in cash and deposits in the enclave amounts to 0 . 2 percent of the total money supply . Matejka told Croatian television the latest estimates put the amount of dinars in deposits at 4 . 7 million of which 2 . 1 million have been converted into kuna . " The figures show the amounts ( of money ) are minimal and the stability of kuna will not be affected ( by the conversion ) in any case , " Matejka said . U . N . officials told Reuters residents of Eastern Slavonia were able to convert dinars worth up to 2 , 000 kuna at 25 post offices and seven bank branches . They said the conversion was going " smoothly . " The introduction of the kuna is one of the most concrete signs of a transfer of rule in an area taken by the Serbs in 1991 , when Croatia seceded from federal Yugoslavia . Zagreb will fully retake the fertile enclave , bordering the Yugslav republic of Serbia to the east , after the current U . N . mandate expires on July 15 . - - Laura Lui , Zagreb newsroom + 385 1 455 7075

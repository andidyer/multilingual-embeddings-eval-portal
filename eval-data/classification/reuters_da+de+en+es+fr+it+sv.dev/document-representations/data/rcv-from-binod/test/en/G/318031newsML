TENNIS - SAMPRAS SURVIVES FIVE SETTER AS HEAT TAKES TOLL . World number one Pete Sampras narrowly survived a five - set battle with a little - known Slovakian teenager , but Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis rarely looked in danger in fourth round matches at the Australian Open on Monday . Dominik Hrbaty , a 19 - year - old ranked 76 in the world , displayed the panache of a champion before Sampras reasserted himself to win 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 4 in two hours and 53 minutes . " There ' s an old saying , it ' s better to be lucky than good and I definitely had a lot more luck than good today , " Sampras told reporters after the match . Hingis , the only leading seed left in the women ' s singles , had a few nervous moments in the first set against Romania ' s Ruxandra Dragomir before recovering to win 7 - 6 6 - 1 in 91 minutes . The women ' s tournament has been depleted of top names after a weekend of upsets which saw world number one Steffi Graf and dumped out . Hingis , the number four seed , is now installed as odds - on favourite to win the event and her next opponent will be another Romanian , eighth seed Irina Spirlea in the quarter - finals . Spirlea beat ninth seed Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 6 - 4 6 - 4 . " I just wanted to win this game and I was just so nervous , I don ' t know why , " said Hingis . " I just felt so different because it is a big grand slam tournament and there is a little chance to - - well , there is a big chance ( to win ) . " While Hingis maintained her composure , American 15th seed Chanda Rubin wilted on the second straight day of heatwave conditions at Melbourne Park . Unseeded Belgian Dominique van Roost ended Rubins ' s run with a 7 - 5 6 - 4 victory , however American 14th seed Mary Joe Fernandez managed to keep her cool , recovering from a slow start to beat unseeded Swiss Patty Schnyder 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 1 . Third seed Goran Ivanisevic tapped into his last reserves of energy as his quest for a first grand slam title continued to build momentum . Fighting back from two sets to one down , he hammered 38 aces on his way to beating unseeded Norwegian Christian Ruud 4 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 3 in match lasting over three hours . Temperatures on Monday were even higher than at the weekend when they soared to 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 Fahrenheit ) on the court . " It was unbelievable I ' ve never played in such conditions before , " Ivanisevic said . " I was out of it , I didn ' t know where I was . " Ivanisevic will next meet Austrian fifth seed Thomas Muster who overcame a series of injuries to beat twice former Open champion Jim Courier 6 - 2 3 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 3 . Muster received treatment for shoulder and hip soreness and blistered toes during a match that lasted two hours and 42 minutes . Sampras next faces Spanish 10th seed Albert Costa who had the easiest day , after eighth seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa retired from their match with a leg injury . After storming to victory on Saturday night , Sampras told reporters he would not even recognise Hrbaty if he bumped into him in the locker room - - although Hrbaty said he had asked Sampras for his autograph at the French Open three years ago . After Monday ' s match , in which the teenager pushed Sampras around the court with long forehands and used a deep and powerful serve to whip up 20 aces , the Florida - based number one is unlikely ever to forget him . " I think he believed he could beat me . I was very impressed , " said Sampras . " I think he ' s going to be a player to be reckoned with in coming years . " The Slovakian is the youngest man in the top 100 and jumped 287 places in 1996 in the fastest rise of any player . He turned professional last year and has so far earned $ 71 , 000 compared to more than $ 25 million earned by Sampras . Down 2 - 4 in the deciding set , Sampras looked to be in a daze , sapped of energy and heading for an upset loss rivalling his third - round exit at last year ' s Australian Open . His tactic of conserving energy , waiting for the grand slam debutant to make mistakes , seemed at best risky as the teenager set pulses racing , earning a break point and a chance to serve for the match at 5 - 2 . Sampras saved the break point and , having closed out the game with an ace , his strategy finally began to pay off . Hrbaty double - faulted in the next game to allow Sampras to even the score at 4 - 4 and then squandered another break point in the ninth game to lose his momentum entirely . Sampras then shattered the Slovakian ' s dream of a grand slam quarter - final berth , breaking him in world number one style with a forehand winner down the line . REUTER

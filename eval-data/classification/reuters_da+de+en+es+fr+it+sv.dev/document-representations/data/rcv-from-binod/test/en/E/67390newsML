FOCUS - Bangladesh sees 1997 as year of investment . Bangladesh , desperate for foreign private capital , expects investment offers next year worth billions of dollars . " 1997 will be a year of investment for Bangladesh , " Industry and Commerce Minister Tofael Ahmed said on Friday . " We are expecting a large volume of foreign investment next year in both infrastructure and manufacturing , " he told Reuters . Ahmed , a kingpin in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ' s government which won a general election in June , said his government had signed memorandums of understanding worth $ 1 . 05 billion in Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) in just two and a half months . This contrasted with only $ 125 million in FDI in the past five years , Ahmed said . " Investors are eventually coming . They are coming in a big way . We are awaiting a breakthrough , " he said . Ahmed said South Korea alone would be investing around $ 1 . 2 billion in Bangladesh ' s manufacturing sector over a decade beginning next year . He said the government was negotiating with South Korean companies to invest in an exclusive Export Processing Zone ( EPZ ) in the port city of Chittagong . " There will be some 130 large and medium industries in the Korean EPZ . An estimated 100 , 000 jobs will be created , " the minister said . Ahmed said Japan also wanted its own industrial park in Chittagong . " We had to pass a law allowing the private sector to set up an EPZ following pressure from overseas investors , " he said . Government officials said the authorities were expanding EPZs in Chittagong and Dhaka and establishing a new one near the capital to meet demand from mostly Southeast Asian countries . While entrepreneurs from Asian neighbours focused on the manufacturing sector , energy companies from Europe and the United States also were keen to set up in Bangladesh . The minister said UNOCAL , a leading U . S . petroleum explorer , had proposed investment worth " several hundred " million dollars for development of a gas field in Bangladesh ' s coastal district of Bhola . " UNOCAL is also proposing a power plant and fertiliser industry using the gas from Bhola field , " Ahmed said . Energy ministry officials said about a dozen leading American companies were awaiting approval to set up power plants in Bangladesh , which has recently opened up its power sector . " The government will do everything possible to facilitate foreign investment . We are determined to act as a facilitator . Sometimes ministers are meeting directly with investors and giving instant decisions , " Ahmed said . He said the government , with the help of the Asian Development Bank , was planning an international investors ' forum in Dhaka by the end of the year .

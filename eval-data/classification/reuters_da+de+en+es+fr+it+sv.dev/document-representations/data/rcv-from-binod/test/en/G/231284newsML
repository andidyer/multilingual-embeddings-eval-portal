N . Carolina serial killer jury hears murder tale . [ CORRECTED 22 : 53 GMT ] ( Corrects headline from S . Carolina to N . Carolina . ) By Lorrie GrantJurors in the murder trial of alleged serial killer Henry Wallace on Tuesday heard the defendant ' s chilling account of sexually assaulting and strangling one victim with a towel before setting her on fire . Family members cried and some left while the audiotaped account , part of hours of interrogation after Wallace was arrested , was played in Mecklenburg County Superior Court . Wallace was arrested in March 1994 and charged with strangling or stabbing to death 10 women between May 1992 and March 1994 while addicted to crack cocaine . The tapes have become the chief evidence for prosecutors who are seeking the death penalty in nine first - degree murder charges that were combined in the current trial . The other murder charge was slated for trial at a later date . The 31 - year - old former restaurant worker sat between defence lawyers with his head down and frequently wrote on a note pad as he heard himself tell police how he killed his friend , Valencia Jumper . " I didn ' t intend to kill her because she was like a sister to me , " he said of the August 1993 , murder . " It just happend . I really don ' t think under normal circumstances I would have done that to her . " He had asked Jumper , 21 , to call a mutual friend but when she turned to walk toward the telephone , he grabbed her in a " choke hold " and forced her to the bedroom where he raped her . " Then I went into the bathroom to wipe the sweat from my body with a towel . I went back in the bedroom and choked her with the towel until she was unconscious and blood ran from her nose , " he said on the tape . Jumper ' s brother shook his head and wiped away tears as he listened to the account . Her father left as Wallace began to describe why firefighters ruled her death accidental . " I wiped away fingerprints , then went in the kitchen and put a pot of beans ( from a can ) on the stove , " the taped account continued . Wallace said he found a bottle of rum and " poured the rum over Valencia and set her on fire . " He also placed a glass of rum by her body . Jumper ' s murder was the first one masked by fire . " I didn ' t want her murder to seem like the others . I wanted to find a different method , " Wallace told investigators . Prosecutors have presented five of the nine cases to the jury of seven women and five men . Defence attorneys said in opening statements that Wallace was mentally ill and not capable of forming the intent to kill , which is necessary to prove first degree murder .

HK ' s H shares eclipsed by red chip compatriots . Misery is an H share investor . Joy holds a red chip portfolio . And little is likely to change for the two types of China - related shares on the Hong Kong stock market , analysts said on Thursday . " Red chips will still outperform , they are still the best in the region , " said Lawrence Ang , head of China research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . Red chips are Hong Kong - based companies with mainland Chinese financial backing , while H shares are Chinese state enterprises or their units listed in Hong Kong . The Hang Seng China - affiliated Corporations Index of 32 red chip companies staged a strong rebound on Thursday , surging 115 . 11 points , or 3 . 75 percent , to 3 , 185 . 02 . The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of 32 H shares also rose , but a smaller 16 . 03 points , or 1 . 68 percent , to 967 . 62 . Over the past 12 months , the red chip index has rocketted 212 . 02 percent , while the H share index has risen 22 . 1 percentThe red chip index was officially launched last month but was backdated to January 1993 . Even this respectable performance by H shares comes after their previous two - and - a - half year long slump . Given that both of groups of companies do most of their business in China and draw their management teams from similar pools of Chinese officials and managers , why is there such a difference in the share price performance ? " Because the investor is different , " Ang explained . Red chip investors are primarily retail investors , while institutions are the main buyers of H shares , Ang said . " There is very little retail investor interest in H shares , " Ang said . " H shares don ' t have the kind of excitement that red chips can provide . " Analysts said the H share market overall is still very much fundamentals driven , except for a few shares which are valued based on the red chip approach , The red chip investment approach is to buy and sell stocks based on expectations of future corporate deals and injections of assets by Chinese parents , and not so much on management strength , quality of financial position , or industry position . " The market pays a premium for merger and acquisition activity , " said Raymond Jook , associate director , China research at SocGen Crosby Securities . Another big problem with H shares is the poor earnings outlook of the many of the companies , which tend to be involved in basic industries such as petrochemicals , steel and machinery . " Corporate earnings in 1997 first half are still not as good as people had expected , " said Ang . " In the past , investors had overestimated the earnings recovery of H shares and were burned . And the outlook is still not good . " " We have revised downwards our earnings for 1997 from 16 percent , forecast at the start of the year , to five to six percent currently , " said Ang . Red chips , on the other hand , are experiencing rapid earnings growth derived from assets newly injected by their parents . Many are also involved in high - demand fields like property and infrastructure development , analysts said . " For our universe of red chips we are expecting 49 percent earnings growth in 1997 and 30 percent in 1998 , " said Jook . Analysts said many red chips had risen too far too fast , especially in a frenzy of buying ahead of Hong Kong ' s return to China last week , and the sector index dropped nearly seven percent on Wednesday , shaking some of the euphoria out . But the downturn was not likely to last long , they said . " It is not a meltdown , " said Sonja Jong , research director at Fortis Investments ( Asia ) Ltd . " If you hold the good ones , you have no need to worry . "

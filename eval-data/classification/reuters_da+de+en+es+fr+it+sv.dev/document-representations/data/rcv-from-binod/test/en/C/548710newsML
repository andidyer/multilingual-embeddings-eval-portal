Australia investing too much in mining - study . Australia was spending too much on the mining industry and too little on manufacturing , market intelligence and forecasting group BIS Shrapnel Pty Ltd said in a report released on Tuesday . Commenting on a new study by the group , chief economist Frank Gelber said investment in the mining industry was so high that the seeds of classic over - supply were being created . This would inevitably result in a weakening of minerals prices over the next two to three years , he said . " Meanwhile , investment in manufacturing is declining and we run the grave risk of incurring capacity constraints over the same time frame , with all the implications for the current account deficit that such a position implies , " he said . The study , Australian Industry Investment Outlook to 2001 , said the Reserve Bank was expected to be required to increase interest rates to stem a tide of imports . Sectors receiving most investment funds were telecommunications , mining and secondary processing . " Investment is too strong in telecommunications , but this is not a cause for concern because the products are maturing and the market will eventually self - correct , " Gelber said . " The problem is in mining . " Australia constantly failed to learn from the past and was once again setting itself up for another cycle of excessive investment , excessive over - supply and a weakening in minerals prices towards the end of the decade , he said . Gelber forecasts a decline in capital expenditure in mining in 2000 / 01 . " But by then it will be too late . The level of expenditure will still be about twice the level achieved in the previous boom of the early 1980s , " he said . The downturn in prices would affect all base metals , although oil and gas should be relatively immune , he said . The current round of investment was driven by the convergence of expected world economic growth and current supply shortages and had been boosted by strong profit levels , he said . The global economic outlook was sound but investments in mining in other countries were at equally unsustainable levels and global growth would be insufficient to absorb the massive global increases in production , he said . " The world copper market is already in oversupply and will remain so until the end of the decade , " he said . " Nickel is expected to move into oversupply around 1999 . Aluminium and alumina markets could also become seriously oversupplied at the end of the decade given the strength of mining investment in other major producer countries , " he said . Declining non - OPEC reserves and production should keep oil prices up , he said . In the longer - term , growth in demand is expected for liquefied natural gas and steaming coal based on Asian demand , he said . This would keep prices robust and provide the basis for feasible investments over the next few years , he said . Major manufacturing investment came through relatively late in the most recent cycle , Gelber said . The economy was already weakening but the currency was strengthening to a level where it was now over - valued and undermining competitiveness , he said . This meant that new capacity was unable to fulfil its prime task of import substitution , he said . " While investment remains at a relatively high level , it is weakening in manufacturing industry , " he said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

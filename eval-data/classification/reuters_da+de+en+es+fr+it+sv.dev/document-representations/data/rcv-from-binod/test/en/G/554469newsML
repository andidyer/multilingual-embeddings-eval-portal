Kuwait boosts Iraq border fortification . Kuwait is improving fortifications on its border with former occupier Iraq to stop Iraqis entering illegally , a newspaper said on Thursday . " Kuwait has started to creat a new security system for the Northern land border , " al - Anba newspaper said . An electrified barbed wire fire with electronic monitoring devices is being built along the 207 km ( 130 mile ) - long desert frontier , it said . The Gulf Arab state is also digging a second trench and creating a sand rampart along the border , it quoted a government statement to parliament as saying . The statement said 45 percent of the trench has been built and the project was expected to be completed in 1998 . Officials have said they planned electronic monitoring with floodlighting and sensors on fortifications built in 1994 to keep out infiltrators . The 1994 fortifications comprise a three - metre ( 10 - foot ) deep and five - metre ( 16 - foot ) wide trench and a tar - covered , four metre ( 13 feet ) high sand rampart . They are about 50 metres ( 160 feet ) from the border . Infiltrations have continued since the fortifications were built and farmers have complained of looting by Iraqi gunmen in the border area , members of parliament said . Iraqis have crossed the closed border to loot farms , collect arms from Gulf War battlefields or seek asylum in third countries since the conflict ended a seven - month Iraqi occupation , Kuwaiti officials say .

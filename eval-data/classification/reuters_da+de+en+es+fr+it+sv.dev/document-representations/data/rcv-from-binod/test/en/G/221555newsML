Released American to be home for Thanksgiving . A young American detained in North Korea for three months as a spy flew to freedom on Wednesday after paying a hotel bill of about $ 5 , 000 but no fine , the congressman who negotiated his release said . A weary - looking Carl Evan Hunziker raised his arms in a victory salute when he stepped from a U . S . Air Force plane that flew him from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to this U . S . air base on the outskirts of Tokyo . Congressman Bill Richardson , a close confidant of President Bill Clinton , said his trip not only freed Hunziker but gave him renewed hope that Pyongyang was ready again to work at decreasing tension on the Korean Peninsula . " He ( Hunziker ) said he was treated in a humanitarian fashion by the North Koreans , " Richardson told reporters . Richardson said it appeared the North Korean military was against releasing Hunziker but in the end they went along with freeing him . After undergoing medical tests , Hunziker , who did not give a news conference , was scheduled to fly to the United States later in the day to be home in time for Thanksgiving Day in the United States on Thursday . Richardson , who in 1994 negotiated the release of a U . S . Air Force helicopter pilot shot down when he strayed into North Korean air space near the border with South Korea , said the United States gave nothing in return for Hunziker ' s release . Asked about demands that Hunziker should pay for time he spent in a hotel while his case was decided , Richardson said : " On that amount , what we paid was a small amount , no more than $ 5 , 000 . North Korean judicial authorities imposed a fine for illegal entry into their country but that fine was not paid . There was no quid pro quo by the United States . " Hunziker , who his family says is a missionary , was detained by North Korea near the border with China on August 24 when he crossed the Yalu River separating the two countries . He was held on charges of espionage and illegal entry . The United States , South Korea and Hunziker ' s family have all denied he is a spy and say he accidentally strayed into North Korea while on a visit to China . " He made a mistake . . . He ' s not a spy , " Richardson said . " He ' s a very religious young man and he was emotional about returning home , " Richardson added . Hunziker ' s eyes widened when he stepped from the U . S . Air Force C - 21 on to foggy Yokota U . S . airbase on the outskirts of Tokyo shortly after midday to face massed ranks of journalists and camera crews . The 26 - year - old from Parkland , Washington , appeared embarrassed , but raised hands with Richardson as U . S . military personnel applauded . Dressed in a grey winter overcoat and blue sweatpants , Hunziker looked well fed but weary after two months confinement in a Pyongyang hotel followed by a month in a provincial detention centre . He strode briskly over to a waiting car which whisked him off to the base ' s hospital . Richardson and Hunziker had been scheduled to leave North Korea for Tokyo on Tuesday but their departure was delayed by Hunziker ' s lengthy transit from the detention centre to the country ' s capital , Richardson said . Asked about details of the negotiations on Tuesday with top North Korean officials to secure Hunziker ' s release , the U . S . congressman said the officials seemed willing to decrease tensions on the Korean peninsula , raised by the intrusion of a northern submarine into South Korean waters earlier this month . " My sense is that the North Korean government wants to get the submarine incident behind it and re - engage with the international community , " Richardson said . " My sense is that ( North Korean leader ) Kim Jong - il is in control , " Richardson added .

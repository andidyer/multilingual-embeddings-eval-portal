Australian pleads not guilty in mass killing trial . The man accused of the worst mass killing in modern Australian history pleaded not guilty on Monday to the first of 35 murder charges . Martin Bryant , 29 , denied killing David Martin , owner of the Seascape guest house , during the massacre on April 28 at the historic convict jail of Port Arthur in the southern island state of Tasmania . The other charges were still being read out in court . The murder charges , and 37 lesser charges including 20 of attempted murder , were being read out one by one to Bryant in the Supreme Court of Tasmania in the state capital Hobart . One charge of attempted murder and another of grievous bodily harm were added on Monday . Bryant ' s guilty plea means that the case will have to go for a full trial in November . The courtroom was ringed by heavy security for the hearing , the first time Bryant has appeared in person in court , and the court ' s main access road has been sealed off . Bryant , who wore a pale suit at the hearing and identified himself in a high , clear voice , has been the subject of numerous death threats since his arrest .

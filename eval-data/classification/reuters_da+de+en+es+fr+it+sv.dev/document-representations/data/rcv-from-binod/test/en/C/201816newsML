Deutsche Telekom rings up big volume in Tokyo . German phone titan Deutsche Telekom made a splash on the Tokyo stock market on Tuesday , as Japanese investors and dealers joined the rush to trade the newly listed share . The stock was the most popular on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ( TSE ) , with five million Deutsche Telekom shares changing hands in the morning session as Japan joined the trading frenzy seen in Europe and the United States on Monday . However , the share price slipped a little from its Tokyo debut level as the post - launch buying spree seen on overseas bourses invited some profit - taking in the Tokyo time zone . " The issue was popular even before it listed all over the world , " said Tadahiro Kamogawa , general manager of the stock information department at Yamaichi Securities . " It ' s only natural that the shares got off to a good start here , carrying over the enthusiasm from Frankfurt and New York . " Trade in Deutsche Telekom easily outpaced that in domestic shares , with hotel operator Gajoen Kanko the most heavily traded domestic issue with 3 . 15 million shares traded on the first section of the Tokyo bourse . Deutsche Telekom shares made their debut on the foreign stocks section of the Tokyo bourse at 2 , 500 yen ( $ 23 ) . However after 10 minutes of furious trade , the shares had slipped down to as low as 2 , 430 yen on profit - taking . " Investors who had bought in overseas markets sold off in Tokyo today , inflating the trade volume as a result , " a broker at a second - tier brokerage said . Brokers added that as the yen - conversion of the Frankfurt closing share price was about 2 , 520 yen , some market participants , especially dealers , were preventing the price from falling past the 2 , 400 yen level . " This sort of price and volume movement is typical of newly listed foreign stocks in Japan , " one broker said . The formerly state - owned firm ' s listing on the TSE is the first by a U . S . or European company since 1993 . Nearly five years ago the exchange prided itself on having 127 foreign issues , but low liquidity , huge costs and the strong yen against the dollar forced many to leave . So far this year , 11 firms have delisted , and after Exxon Corp leaves in December , only 66 will be left , TSE officials said . Telekom officials said they were attracted to Japan as it is the second - largest capital market in the world after New York . The shares were first listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange priced at 28 . 5 marks ( $ 19 ) in what was Europe ' s biggest ever flotation . They started trade on Monday at a 16 . 5 percent premium and closed at 33 . 90 marks , with about 38 million shares traded . Trade on Wall Street was also heady , with the issue closing 14 percent higher at 2 - 39 / 64 above the $ 21 - 1 / 2 pricing and with million shares traded . ( $ 1 = 111 yen , 1 . 50 marks )

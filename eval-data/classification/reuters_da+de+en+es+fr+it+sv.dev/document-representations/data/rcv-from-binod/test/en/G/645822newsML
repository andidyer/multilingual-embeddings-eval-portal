PLO official says no " pause " agreement with Israel . A senior Palestinian negotiator said on Sunday Israel had not agreed to any preconditions on settlement building ahead of a meeting it was due to hold with Palestinians in Cairo . When asked by reporters to comment on a statement made by another Palestinian official earlier that Israel had agreed to a " pause " in settlement building , Saeb Erekat told reporters " there is no agreement with the Israeli side " . Israel and the PLO agreed on Saturday to revive the talks after a two - month break by meeting in Cairo but the gathering was thrown into doubt when Palestinian President Yasser Arafat ' s spokesman Marwan Kanafani said the Jewish state had agreed to a " pause " in settlement building . Erekat said the meeting with Israel would still take place in Cairo on Sunday but that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must reconsider his position on settlements if he wanted to make progress in peace talks . " Mr Netanyahu knows what is needed to get the peace process on track , " Erekat said . Israel ' s talks with the PLO have been in crisis since the Jewish state broke ground three months ago on the 6 , 500 - unit Jewish settlement of Har Homa on an Arab East Jerusalem hill Palestinians call Jabal Abu Ghneim . Construction continued on Sunday .

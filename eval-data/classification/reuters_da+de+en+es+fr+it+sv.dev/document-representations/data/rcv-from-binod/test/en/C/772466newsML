Hopewell working on Thai rail financing . Hopewell Holdings Ltd said on Friday it was continuing to work closely with bankers on a financing solution for its Bangkok mass transit project which will be presented to the Thai government in detail next month . Hopewell reaffirmed its commitment to the Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System ( BERTS ) after a meeting with the State Railway of Thailand on Friday . The company said meetings were held with bankers in Europe and London last week and good progress has been made , but added bankers require more time to conclude their financial planning . Hopewell said it asked senior officials from the Bank Group to meet with the Thai government as soon as possible to confirm their commitment to the project , present the progress on the financing plan and timetable , and obtain views and suggestions . The Bank Group includes Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau , Bayerische Landesbank , Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , Westdeutsche Landesbank Group , and West Merchant Bank , it said . Hopewell said it will meet separately with the government if requested . The original schedule for the project financing has been affected by the decline of the economic climate in Thailand and the devaluation of the baht , and that funding for any project in Thailand is now harder , the company said . Hopewell said despite various issues faced by the project , it strongly believes that financial closing can be achieved , and that it continued to work with the Bank Group on a solution which will be presented to the government in detail next month . Hopewell earlier said it has received no formal deadline from the Thai government . Sathien Wongvichien , Thailand ' s Deputy Permanent Secretary for Transport and Communications , said on July 24 that if Hopewell could not come up with a firm financing package by the end of July , the ministry could exercise its contractual right to scrap the 30 - year BERTS operating concession awarded to Hopewell in 1990 . Hopewell Chairman Gordon Wu said on July 21 that the financing structure was in place , but added he did not want to take the money until Bangkok promised to clear land acquisition problems and agreed to a fare rise to cover increased costs . On Friday , Standard and Poor ' s affirmed its BBB - minus corporate crdit rating on Hopewell and revised the outlook for the company to stable from negative . The rating agency said Hopewell ' s sale of its power unit had allowed it to cut leverage and better focus on management of its existing portfolio and future investment commitments . But the rating still reflected considerable uncertainty regarding the future of BERTS and its implementation , which helped reduce the potential for any upgrade , S & P said . - - Hong Kong newsroom ( 852 ) 2843 6933

Taiwan stocks end up slightly on bargain hunting . Taiwan share prices ended slightly higher on Saturday on bargain hunting following a sharp plunge the previous day , but brokers expected a continued correction phase in the near term . The weighted index edged up four points or 0 . 05 percent higher to close at 8 , 234 . 07 points , hardly recovering from Friday ' s 262 - point slump which followed a ban on pork exports and speculation the government wants to cool the market . Turnover was a heavy T $ 103 . 078 billion . " Bargain hunters concentrated their buying in the relatively low priced shares , particularly steels , after Friday ' s tumble , " said manager Joe Chiou of Taiwan Securities Investment . Brokers , however , expect a near - term correction due to several negative factors overhanging the market , including a ban on pork exports which the government estimates will knock 0 . 5 percentage point from economic growth . Taiwan on Thursday ordered a ban on exports of fresh and frozen pork following the outbreak of the contagious foot and mouth disease . The ban is expected to lead to T $ 42 . 5 billion in lost exports .

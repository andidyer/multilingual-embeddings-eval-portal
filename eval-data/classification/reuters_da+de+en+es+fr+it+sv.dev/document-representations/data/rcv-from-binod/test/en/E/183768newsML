UAE ' s Dubai says to end oil reliance by 2010 . United Arab Emirates member state Dubai said on Tuesday it would end reliance on oil by the year 2010 by diversifying its investment base under broad goals set for the next 35 years .

" The vision set for Dubai is that of attaining the status and orientation of a developed economy on the strength of non - oil components of the economy by the year 2010 . " Beyond this target date ( say 2010 - 2030 ) , the aim will be to catch up with the first league of developed economies . . . in at least three areas ; economic dynamism , quality of life and regional cooperation and integration , " Alabbar said . Expanding on broad targets given in Dubai ' s first five - year economic plan unveiled on Saturday , he said the emirate aims at five percent annual growth to 2015 and four percent after that . The city , the commercial heart of the seven - member UAE , has promoted itself as a major regional trading and tourist centre to cut reliance on oil output , which analysts forecast will fall to some 180 , 000 barrels per day in 1998 from 1995 ' s 300 , 000 bpd . It expects a yearly 6 . 9 percent rise in non - oil GDP to 2000 and seeks to increase the non - oil sector ' s contribution to GDP to 88 . 7 percent by then and to 100 percent between 2010 - 2015 from a current 81 . 2 percent .

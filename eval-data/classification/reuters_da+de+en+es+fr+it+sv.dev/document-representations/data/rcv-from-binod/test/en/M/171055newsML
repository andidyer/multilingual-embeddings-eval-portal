By Colin BrinsdenLong - dated Australian bonds rallied as post - rate cut profit - taking was absorbed and as U . S . bonds took off in Tokyo after the U . S . election came out as expected . The benchmark November 2006 bond yield closed at its lowest level since early March 1994 at just below 7 . 20 percent and analysts believe it could be testing 7 . 0 percent before long . " Aussie bonds have done very well in the last six months and have rallied around 175 basis points both in yield and spread , " said Stephen Koukoulas , chief economist at Citibank Australia . " Our view would be that there ' s probably a bit more to go , " Koukoulas added , citing a yield below 7 . 0 percent and a yield spread to the U . S . of 50 to 75 basis points . The Australian / U . S . 10 - year bond yield spread closed was around 95 basis points . As widely expected , the Reserve Bank shaved 50 basis points off official interest rates to 6 . 50 percent , is second policy easing of the year . Although some of the market had been looking for a bigger cut , there ' s was little to suggest that the easing cycle is over in the RBA ' s accompanying statement and March bill futures are pricing at least a 25 basis points easing by maturity . The RBA said it reflected the improved inflation outlook and that wages growth at 3 . 5 percent was compatible with its 2 . 0 - 3 . 0 percent inflation target , although it is still concerned about the size of executive wage increases negotiated through enterprise agreements . " A further cut in cash rates can ' t be ruled out at this stage , particularly if economic data remains soft and if the pace of enterprise agreements moderates , " said Shane Oliver , chief economist at AMP Investments . However , he felt that rates would stabilise around these levels for some time . " The Reserve Bank will want to avoid easing too far , particularly in an environment where enterprise agreements are strong , " Oliver added . The Australian labour force report for October is due on Thursday , data that may prove useful for gauging the chance of another easing down the track . A small bounce back is expected in employment , although median forecasts centre on the unemployment rate sticking at 8 . 7 percent , according to a Reuters survey of economists . Employment is expected to rise 12 , 000 after the 34 , 100 drop in September . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( SPREADS ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - AUD VS 3 - YR 10 - YR * AUD 3 - YR / 10 - YR SPREAD USD 70 ( + 04 ) 95 ( + 01 ) * FUTURES 60 ( - 09 ) CAD 213 ( + 13 ) 106 ( + 08 ) * CASH 63 ( - 10 ) NZD - 48 ( + 07 ) + 06 ( - 03 ) * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Bond yield spreads remained slightly wider against the U .

I ' m no liberal , Clinton says . President Bill Clinton on Monday rejected Republican challenger Bob Dole ' s description of him as a liberal , saying his record proved otherwise . " The record doesn ' t support the charge , " Clinton said at a White House ceremony when he was asked about Dole ' s latest salvo . Clinton ticked off several programmes and policies that he said had a decidedly unliberal cast including welfare reform , tough anti - crime measures and deficit reduction . " It is true that ( Dole ) and I had differences over the budget last year and we will again in this campaign . And we have different tax cut plans . But I don ' t think that qualifies me as a closet liberal , " Clinton said . With tongue in cheek , he added : " the president is too exposed ( to be a liberal ) . I don ' t have a closet . " While the Democratic president made light of Dole ' s effort to brand him a liberal - - now a dirty word in the U . S . political lexicon - - his spokesman accused the Republican candidate of taking the low road . Dole and his supporters " utterly . . . have gone negative and that is a source of concern because it degrades prospects for a vigorous debate about the two different visions for the future that are out there - - the president ' s versus Mr . Dole ' s , " White House press secretary Mike McCurry said .

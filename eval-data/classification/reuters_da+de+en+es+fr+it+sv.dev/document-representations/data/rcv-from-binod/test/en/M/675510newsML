Dlr firm in Europe but trade subdued as G7 looms . The dollar idled just below session highs against the mark and yen in late European trade but activity was subdued as the weekend ' s G7 summit meeting in Denver , Colorado got underweigh . Dollar / mark was firmer in afternoon Europe , mainly on the back of profit - taking in mark / yen , while dollar / yen managed to hold the bulk of recent gains coming into the G7 . But dealers said late ranges were fairly narrow and volume low . Sterling was the biggest mover in an otherwise quiet day , posting a fresh 58 - month high against the mark as the prospect of higher near - term UK interest rates continued to simmer . Dealers said much of the perceived friction between the U . S . and Japan over Japan ' s trade surplus had dissipated after Thursday ' s smaller - than - expected U . S . April trade deficit and comments overnight from U . S . President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto . " The Clinton - Hashimoto talks look to have taken a lot of the heat out of the meeting , " said Peter Wood , forex dealer at Bank of Boston . " And we don ' t expect to see too much grousing about forex , it shouldn ' t be much different from previous meetings . " Although concerned about the Japan ' s surplus , Clinton said exchange rates should not be used to redress trade balances . " Trade will play some role in the G7 discussions , which might see the yen a touch firmer next week , " said Steven Hannah , director of economic research at IBJ International . " But I don ' t expect it to be too big an issue given that Clinton has already made it clear that talking the dollar down is not the appropriate way to deal with the problem . " Dollar / yen was trading at 114 . 54 / 59 at 1536 GMT , down from an earlier high of 114 . 75 and above late Thursday ' s 114 . 13 / 23 . Against the mark , the dollar stood at 1 . 7290 / 97 after touching a session peak of 1 . 7325 and 1 . 7246 / 56 Thursday while mark / yen was at 67 . 24 / 27 from 66 . 19 / 22 . Once G7 is out of the way , dealers were looking ahead to Japan ' s second - quarter Tankan survey of corporate sentiment due next week . This is expected to show further signs of Japanese economic growth and along with the Japan trade surplus situation , will provide further fuel for a firmer yen . Sterling / mark tested new 58 - month highs above 2 . 86 in Europe with dealers citing option and stop - loss levels around 2 . 85 marks contributing to its gains . " There was a lot triggered at that 2 . 85 , but markets have been thin this week . It will be interesting to see if we can hold above 2 . 85 next week , " said a UK bank dealer . Sterling / mark was trading at 2 . 8605 / 15 after touching a peak of 2 . 8645 marks , well above 2 . 8410 / 20 late Thursday in Europe . Against the dollar , the pound was also firmer at $ 1 . 6539 / 49 from $ 1 . 6480 / 90 Thursday . - - Andrew Reierson , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 6745

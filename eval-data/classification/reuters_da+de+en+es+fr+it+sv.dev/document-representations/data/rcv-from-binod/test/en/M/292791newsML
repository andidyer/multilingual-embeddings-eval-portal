High - grade U . S corporates keep rising ; junk slumps . Continuing a trend started at the beginning of the week , prices of investment - grade U . S . corporate bonds rose on Wednesday , while junk prices slumped in listless trading , market players said . " The broader high - grade market , particularly higher - yielding paper , is being lifted by improving technicals and fundamentals in several sectors , " said Joseph Labriola , head of high - grade research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . He noted gains in bank sector preferred stock and cable and media sector straight debt had helped fuel the rally in the overall high - grade market . " Although there will be a flurry of new debt issuance , there is no longer a fear that a big overhang of supply will put pressure on secondary market spreads , " he added . Labriola said many issuers would wait until rates were lower before issuing more debt . In the primary market , high - grade issuers sold $ 1 . 4 billion in new debt on Wednesday . No junk deals were priced . Merrill Lynch & Co Inc sold $ 500 million in bonds and Lehman Brothers sold $ 300 million of debt . Tosco Corp , which refines and markets petroleum products , sold $ 600 million via Morgan Stanley & Co Inc . In junk , overall market prices were down 1 / 8 to 3 / 8 in light trading . Spreads tightened relative to Treasuries , however , as prices in the government market fell even further . The price of the 30 - year benchmarket Treasury fell 20 / 32 to 95 - 21 / 32 . Its yield , which moves inversely to price , rose to 6 . 84 percent . Elsewhere in the junk market , Trump Castle bonds dropped to 81 from 85 1 / 2 on continued concerns about the company ' s earnings , traders said . Junk bonds in the paper sector also fell today . Riverwood International and Wisconsin Repap bonds fell by one point , traders said . Sharyl Van Winkle , paper sector high - yield analyst at Merrill Lynch , said the reason for the price drop was that investors are reassessing their views on the sector . Bonds in the paper sector have experienced a substantial rally over the past month and a half , rallying by 115 basis points on average , she noted . " The paper sector has tightened in an environment where the news is definitely not getting better . Basically ( paper ) prices are still declining and that will hurt these companies ' revenues , " she said . - Douglas Brown , 212 - 859 - 1662

Peru hostages to spend Easter under rebel guns . Hostages held by Marxist rebels at the besieged Japanese ambassador ' s home looked certain on Wednesday to spend Easter in captivity , even though momentum appeared to be gathering for a deal to end the crisis . The 72 male hostages have already spent the Christmas and New Year holidays away from their families during 14 agonizing weeks under the gun of 20 - odd heavily armed members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) . Despite talk of an imminent asylum agreement in diplomatic and media circles in Lima , no one seriously expected them out in time for Easter weekend celebrations . Red Cross representative Michel Minnig and Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent , two of the three guarantors overseeing talks , met on Wednesday with the rebels inside the besieged residence . They were believed to be finalising details for fresh face - to - face negotiations scheduled for early next week . " It seems there will be talks again Monday or Tuesday , " Bolivia ' s acting ambassador told local radio CPN . Bolivia ' s Ambassador Jorge Gumucio is one of the remaining 72 hostages . The last such talks took place on March 12 and President Alberto Fujimori has said that their resumption would bring the crisis to its final stage . The third guarantor , Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani , was in his diocese of Ayacucho to lead the highland town ' s Easter religious ceremonies . He told reporters there courage was needed for the two sides to reconcile their differences . " There has to be courage . . . to call someone who is not a friend your friend . Courage sometimes brings people together , " Cipriani said . Diplomats said both the government and MRTA rebels were close to agreement on an asylum deal for the rebels , but other elements of a negotiated solution were still being hotly debated . Red Cross spokesman Steven Anderson said the hostages were closely following the speculation and debate over their fate from radios inside the residence . Peruvians , whose Christmas festivities were overshadowed by the hostage crisis , which began on Dec . 17 , were again preparing to focus their religious holiday on the captives . The Roman Catholic bishop of Lima ' s neighbouring port Callao , Miguel Irizar , said a Via Crucis ( Way of the Cross ) procession would be held on Friday in honour of the captives . " Let ' s hope that Easter ends with the freedom of all the hostages , because in a certain way , we also feel like prisoners in the Japanese ambassador ' s residence , " he said . Others planned Masses and candlelight vigils around the country to show solidarity with the hostages . Local media were speculating that a behind - the - scenes deal , masterminded by the three - man guarantors ' commission to end the 99 - day saga , was taking final shape . The daily La Republica said on Wednesday the deal , to be finalised next week , included the freedom of some low - ranking MRTA prisoners , an amnesty and ransom payment to the rebels , and asylum in Cuba or the Dominican Republic for the hostage - takers . Ambassador Vincent further fuelled speculation that the two sides were readying for the rebels to leave for Havana when he visited the Cuban ambassador ' s residence following his earlier meeting with the hostage - takers . The MRTA has from the outset demanded the freedom of all its roughly 450 prisoners in Peru , while Fujimori ' s government has consistently ruled this out . Without alluding directly to that issue , Fujimori said on Wednesday in the highland city of Huancayo : " In Peru , there must not be terrorists walking freely , there must not be terrorists free . Those who should be free are the authentic citizens who work for Peru . " There was speculation , however , that some releases might be allowed under a special commission set up before the crisis to award pardons to prisoners falsely accused of terrorism .

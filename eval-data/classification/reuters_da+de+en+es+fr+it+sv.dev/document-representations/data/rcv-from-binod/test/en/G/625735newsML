MOTOR RACING - HILL DENIES UNHAPPY WITH ARROWS . World champion Damon Hill , without even a finish in this season ' s first six Grands Prix , on Friday reiterated his faith in his struggling Arrows team . " I read a lot of reports from the races and they seem to give the impression that I am despondent , I ' m unhappy , I ' m dejected , and I ' m cross . But it couldn ' t be further from the truth , " Hill said at a public open day at TWR Arrows factory . Hill , dropped by Williams at the end of his championship winning season last year , said he had total confidence in team manager Tom Walkinshaw . " I am very happy , I have got a lot of faith in Tom and the Arrows team . It ' s been a tough season , but I have been through tough seasons before and this is a great car in the early stages of development . These things are not going to happen overnight . " Walkinshaw admitted he had had ' very , very serious ' talks with the team engine supplier and added : " I have every faith that Yamaha will do everything that they possibly can to improve the reliablity and performance of the engine . " Hill will test a revised version of his current engine at a secret location next week and , if it proves a success , may run it during qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix on June 15 .

French govt not sure Renault closure inevitable . French junior industry minister Christian Pierret said on Tuesday the government was happy there would be an objective study of Renault plans to close its Vilvoorde assembly plant and that it was not sure that the closure was inevitable . " We ' re not certain that what was announced a few weeks back by the company - - and very abruptly too - - is absolutely essential and definitive , " Pierret said on French LCI television . " The dossier has now been reopened , " he said , adding that Renault ' s plans to commission an independent study of the Belgian assembly plant closure plan would ensure " objectivity on the move " . Pierret was speaking as a Renault annual shareholders ' meeting was underway and after the company announced that it was ordering an independent study into its Belgian closure plans . Renault said in a statement chairman Louis Schweitzer had proposed that the board meet again before the end of June to examine the conclusions of the study .

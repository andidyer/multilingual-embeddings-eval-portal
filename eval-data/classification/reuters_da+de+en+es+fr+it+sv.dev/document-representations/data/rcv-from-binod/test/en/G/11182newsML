Tight security in Trinidad after coup scare . Police have beefed up security in Trinidad and Tobago to quell fears of an uprising fuelled by tensions between the government of the twin - island Caribbean nation and its Moslem minority . Brig . Carl Alfonso , who heads the Trinidad and Tobago defence force , assured the public his troops and other security forces were loyal to the government . " The army is committed to the public safety and is prepared to work hand - in - hand with the police , " he told Reuters . Rumours of an uprising similar to a violent coup attempt launched six years ago by the radical Black Moslem group , Jamaat Al - Moslemeen , came to a head last Friday after a radio report of an anti - government plot linked to the Jamaat . Workers were sent home from work early . Government officials have dismissed the radio report as " malicious speculation " . But police have beefed up security at government buildings , set up roadblocks at key intersections and mounted more frequent patrols . National Security Minister Joe Theodore said the government was investigating information it received last Saturday that some 300 army - type combat uniforms had been brought into the country and distributed . He asked the public to report to the police anyone in possession of such uniforms . Jamaat members on July 27 , 1990 , failed in a bid to topple the government of then - Prime Minister Ray Robinson in a coup attempt that killed 34 people . More recently the group has been at odds with the government of Prime Minister Basdeo Panday over the state ' s attempt to evict Jamaat from a stretch of land on the western fringe of Port of Spain . Jamaat wants the government to compensate it for the destruction of its headquarters , and won a compensation award of more than $ 1 million in 1994 . But the money has never been distributed because it has been tied up in court , officials said . Minister of Legal Affairs Kamla Persad - Bissesar said the government could not act until there was a final resolution in the courts . Jamaat attorney Subhas Panday , who also is the prime minister ' s younger brother and a former member of parliament , said the Moslem organisation wanted the money and intended to take action to get it . But he said it would not be violent . " The Jamaat will do nothing to disturb the peace and quiet or in any way endanger the security and stability of the society , " he said . Of Trinidad ' s 1 . 2 million population , 33 percent are Roman Catholic , 25 percent are Hindu and six percent are Moslem . About 40 percent of the population is of African descent , and about 40 is Indian , with the remainder of mixed , European and Chinese descent .

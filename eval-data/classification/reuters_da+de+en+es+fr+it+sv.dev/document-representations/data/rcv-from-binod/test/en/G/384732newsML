Netanyahu faces political crisis , police questions . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought on Tuesday to avert a split in his coalition over settlement policy in Jerusalem and on a separate front underwent police questioning on alleged government corruption . Netanyahu , fresh from a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington , forbade a ministerial committee on Jerusalem from discussing a controversial project to build on a forested hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the West Bank . But the ministers agreed instead to speed up the building of roads in and around Arab East Jerusalem , officials said . The PLO regards the eastern part of the city as the future capital of a Palestinian state and views Israeli construction of housing and roads there as an obstacle to a final peace settlement . Asked what would happen if Netanyahu cancelled the Har Homa project , Jewish settler leader Pinchas Wallerstein told Israel Radio : " Then there will be no coalition " . Facing another potential threat to his government , Netanyahu submitted to 4 - 1 / 2 hours of police questioning over allegations a short - lived appointment of an attorney - general last month was part of a deal with a politician already on trial on corruption charges . Police are probing Israel Television allegations that religious Shas party leader Aryeh Deri had demanded Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar - On be named attorney - general in exchange for Shas ' s support of the Netanyahu ' s Hebron deal with the PLO . The television also said Bar - On promised Deri a plea - bargain that would have let him continue his political career . Bar - On quit on the same day he took office amid complaints by jurists and politicians he was a judicial lightweight . Israeli troops pulled out of most of Hebron last month . Netanyahu , Bar - On and Deri have denied any wrongdoing . " As was expected , the prime minister cooperated and told what he knew and answered all our questions , " Sando Mazor , head of the national police investigative division , told reporters after Netanyahu was questioned . " If the need arises to pose additional questions to the prime minister , it will be carried out in coordination with the prime minister ' s complicated schedule , " Mazor said . Earlier , Netanyahu postponed debate on Har Homa for at least a week , officials said . Critics of the project said it would spark Palestinian rage that could prove more costly than gunbattles that killed 61 Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers last year after Netanyahu opened a new entrance to a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem . " We are talking about a ' tunnel ' that will be longer , darker and more dangerous , " Yossi Sarid , a leader of the left - wing Meretz party , said about the Har Homa plan . Netanyahu denied on Tuesday having pledged to freeze the project in talks at the White House last week . However , he refrained from stating when a decision might be taken . Participants in the ministerial meeting quoted Shin Bet secret police chief Ami Ayalon as cautioning the ministers : " Even if the Palestinian leader ( Yasser Arafat ) is not interested in violence at this point , the sensitivity of Jerusalem could cause the situation to get out of his control . " The Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem , Faisal Husseini , said on Tuesday that if Netanyahu approved the plans to build 6 , 500 homes at Har Homa , known to Arabs as Jebel Abu Ghneim , the PLO would view it as a " decision of war " . Cabinet minister Natan Sharansky , who has made government approval of Har Homa a condition of his support , rejected suggestions the decision be put off at least until after March 7 , when Israel is due to carry out the first of three troop withdrawals in rural West Bank areas . The National Religious Party , a driving force behind settlement , also threatened coalition unity .

No disarmament before Albanian elections - minister . Albania ' s justice minister said on Wednesday it would be impossible to disarm the population in the volatile country in time for a general election in June . Spartak Ngjela told a meeting with international mediator Franz Vranitzky that the government should nevertheless make it an offence to possess weapons during the voting period in an effort to ensure calm and order . " The population is almost entirely armed today . It is impossible to disarm the population . . . in two months , " he said . " A partial disarmament . . . will not be sufficient for the elections " . Ngjela recommended that a new electoral law , which must be drafted ahead of the vote , should try to regulate possession of guns looted from state armouries in a widespread insurrection . He said a specific chapter should be included in the law stating that " a person found in possession of weapons in the city from such a date to such a date will be punished " . Albania has been awash with guns since the popular uprising erupted at the end of February after the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes in which thousands lost their life savings . An estimated one million rifles and other weapons were stolen by rebel gangs and ordinary Albanians from depots left undefended when soldiers and police deserted their posts . Some 300 people have been killed and 700 injured . Banditry remains rife , especially in the south . An Italian - led multinational security force sent to protect relief supplies began its mission on Tuesday and soldiers in armoured personnel carriers could already seen on some streets . But the U . N . - backed mission has no mandate to disarm Albanians . Ngjela , a member of the Legality Movement which supports the return to power of exiled King Leka , said elections were now Albania ' s best hope . " I am of the opinion that the only chance we have is new elections , " he said . Albania ' s last general election , in May 1996 , returned President Sali Berisha to power by a landslide , but international observers said there were irregularities . The opposition Socialist Party boycotted the election . Berisha , blamed by many Albanians for the recent chaos , installed an emergency unity government with socialist Bashkim Fino as prime minister a month ago . He also agreed to hold early elections by the end of June . Ngjela said matters were complicated by the fact that parties had still not agreed on whether to use a majority or proportional representation system , or a mixture of the two . " I think the current law . . . should be changed , " he said . Under current rules , 120 of Albania ' s 140 seats in parliament are elected by majority voting . He appealed to Vranitzky to help reach a compromise . The Democratic Party has said there is no need for a change . " This law is so important that it is much more important to reach a consensus than to have a perfect law , " Ngjela said , adding it also had to provide for equal access to Albania ' s only state - run television channel during the campaign . Vranitzky agreed that elections should be held by the end of June . " We will give the best of all advice we can , we will bring the best experts Europe can bring to achieve this goal , " he said .

NWE fuel barges notch higher as low avails support . European high sulphur barges closed a touch higher on Thrusday , managing to break above the previous day ' s trading levels , with low avails said to have propped up the market . High sulphur cargoes were quiet with some traders saying they were talked higher with the market tighter on Russian supply . One percent was steady to firmer on offers , but no buyer interest was seen at higher numbers . After initially trading between $ 84 and $ 85 fob ARA , or the trading range since Monday , high sulphur barges were done a few times at $ 85 . 50 . Late talk was said to be in the $ 85 / $ 86 region . Most traders said earlier in the day that low demand would keep the market unchanged but others said later that weak supply was behind the modest rise . " Russian material is not coming out a lot . People realise there ' s shortness in the market so they ' re buying , " one trader with a major said . But a second trader said : " It ' s really hard to predict this market , crude is coming down again . " Low sulphur barges continued inactive , with sellers at $ 97 for regular material and $ 99 for 100 C flash , while buyers were about $ 1 below those levels . Traders were divided on high sulphur cargoes with some saying values had risen with the market seeking Russian cracked material , while others said some avails were still around and they see pressure setting in . A few buyers , mainly refiners , were heard looking around the market . " I heard bids today at two means plus $ 2 . 50 / $ 3 , which is higher than yesterday , " one trader said . But others said a trader had a few M - 100 cracked cargoes , and was not declaring a price but rather awaiting bids . The seller had recently switched from asking a fixed price around the $ 81 . 50 mark . One percent was again heard offered steady to a notch higher with one Norwegian trader and two other sellers at the $ 95 / $ 95 . 50 mark , but no deals were concluded although two or three buyers were heard active on the market . " No one is putting their money where their mouths are , " one seller said . A trader seconded that view adding : " I don ' t think there is buying interest at those levels .

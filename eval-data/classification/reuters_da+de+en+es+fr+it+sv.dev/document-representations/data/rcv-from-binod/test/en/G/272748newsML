Yachting - Hobart sailors question yacht safety . The Sydney - to - Hobart starting Thursday is regarded as one of the toughest ocean races in the world - - but some sailors question whether the latest hi - tech yachts are safe enough for its treacherous conditions . Modern materials such as carbon fibre have allowed yacht designers to build lightweight , high - performance boats which are great fun to sail inshore or on short ocean races . But when forced to endure prolonged foul weather many simply begin to break up . In fact , owners now take this for granted . " Its the toughest ocean race in the world and I think it has to be treated with respect , " George Snow , owner of second race favourite Australian maxi Brindabella , says of the Hobart . " I think the guys that can sail their boats and keep their boats together in hard conditions will do well . " In 1993 , mountainous 11 - metre ( 35 - foot ) seas and 70 - knot gales forced 67 boats to retire from a 106 - strong Hobart fleet . Many boats limped to a safe haven port with their hi - tech hulls cracked and their crews bailing water . Bob Mills , a veteran of a dozen Hobarts , last week questioned what would happen if this year ' s 94 - boat fleet encounters a storm sea like 1963 . That year 80 knot - plus winds hit the fleet yet 80 percent of the boats finished the 630 - nautical mile race . Mills argues that yacht designers have been allowed to focus on performance at the expense of safety under the latest IMS ( International Measurement System ) rules , citing the design factor called " human ballast " . Crews are now required to sit on the edge of lightweight yachts , feet dangling over the side , in order for them to perform properly and not slide sideways . " Without that weight the boat just will not go where it is pointed , but instead slip sideways because , among other things , it is heeled over too far for its keel to get a proper grip in the water , " Mills wrote in The Australian Financial Review . " For most of the last 100 years ocean racing yachts were designed to be able to sail efficiently , in rough weather and even in extreme conditions , with most of the crew below decks . " Mills said the prime target of Britain ' s Yacht Racing Association a century ago was to discourage light - displacement yachts that simply skimmed across the ocean . The lighter a yacht , the faster the boat ' s speed . When the new IMS rules were introduced in the 1980s they produced a crop of safer boats , but those rules are now being manipulated , said Mills , adding that the quest for line honours is pushing designers towards faster , lighter boats . Some of the fastest yachts in this year ' s Hobart race are downwind flyers which with a tailwind skim along the top of the ocean at incredible speeds . Round - the - world Australian solo yachtsman Ian Kiernan agrees that today ' s modern ocean racers are simply not safe enough . " I have been to a lot of memorial services for a lot of friends who have drowned at sea and a number of those have drowned because they have been in boats that have not been up to the extreme weather conditions , " Kiernan told Reuters . " These modern boats are designed for minimum tolerances . If you get extreme conditions they break and the rest of the yachting community is subsidising that through their insurance premiums . " Kiernan , who will be sailing his 36 - year - old timber yawl Maris in this year ' s Hobart , believes race organisers should give owners some insentive to build safer yachts . He also disputes that safer boats are not competitive , citing the 1928 timber sloop Southerly , sailed by 72 - year - old Don Mickleborough , which won 3rd overall in last year ' s Hobart . " I really applaud that sort of result because he was there sailing his boat beyond its ability and safely , " Kiernan said . Australia ' s top yacht designer and former America ' s Cup skipper , Iain Murray , says design rules are adequate and believes safety starts with improving sailing skills . " I am not going to say that all the current IMS boats are going to make it through any particular storm , " said Murray . " If you want to start with safety at sea you want to start with the people before the boats , " said Murray , who will helm his newly launched racer - cruiser Sydney in the Hobart . " The bottom line is very few people have enough respect of the sea and no one will ever win against the sea . The wrong boat in the wrong hand is a diabolical mixture .

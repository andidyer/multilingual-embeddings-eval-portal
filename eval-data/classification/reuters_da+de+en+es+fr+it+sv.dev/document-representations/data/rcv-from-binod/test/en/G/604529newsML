GOLF - CAST OF STARS FOR BRITISH PGA . A field full of the cream of European golf is fortified this week by a strong presence from the U . S . Tour in one of the best casts the prestigious British PGA championship has ever had . Nick Faldo , Ernie Els , Jesper Parnevik , Vijay Singh and Frank Nobilo have made the trip to take on the might of Colin Montgomerie and everybody else who is anybody in the European Tour beginning on Friday . All 12 members of the 1995 European team who won the Ryder Cup at Oak Hill are playing in the event ranked second in importance on the Tour behind the British Open . So , too , is every contender for European team places at this year ' s contest against the Americans at Valderrama in September . Faldo , the architect of the 1995 success , is at Wentworth to challenge for Ryder Cup points in hopes of earning automatic selection for this year ' s match . He lost the chance of boosting his points total by missing the cut last month at the U . S . Masters , which now counts for the European qualifying table . " So I thought it would be a fair trade to play this one , " said Faldo , who could force his way into the top 10 in the Cup standings if he were to capture the 183 , 340 pounds sterling ( $ 303 , 000 ) first prize for the fifth time this weekend . " It ' s a challenge and I ' m competitive . If I were to win here and somewhere else , like in a major , that would be it , " he said . The top 10 in the standings at the end of September qualify by right for the 12 - man team , which is completed by two wild card picks from the captain , Seve Ballesteros . Faldo , seeking a fifth PGA triumph , is certain to be one of them if he does not win a spot by right . Parnevik , a Swede who is having a superb year on the U . S . Tour , is also hoping to impress the selectors even though he cannot qualify for the team by right because he did not maintain his European Tour membership when he defected to the U . S . Tour last year . Els is returning to the venue where he has won the World Matchplay title for the last three years . " Now it is time to prove I can win a strokeplay title here as well , " he said . Nobilo , the New Zealander who won the Greater Greensboro Open last month , and Singh complete the group of U . S . Tour invaders . Ballesteros is playing , still hopeful of forcing his way into his own team as a player despite missing the cut in the first six of his eight events this year . He has won twice to go with five victories in the Matchplay . Compatriot Jose Maria Olazabal is almost sure of a team place in 11th spot after only seven events since his return from serious foot problems and can clinch it with a good finish in the tournament he won in 1994 . Montgomerie , Europe ' s highest world - ranked player at number six , will savour his prospects of winning here for the first time after rediscovering his missing putting touch to win the European zone of the Andersen Consulting world championship on Tuesday . Bernhard Langer comes in on a roll after capturing the Italian and Benson and Hedges International Opens in successive weeks this month . He brings with him the record total of 270 for Wentworth ' s West course , which he set when he won in 1987 . He also won in 1993 and 1995 . Costantino Rocca of Italy is defending the title .

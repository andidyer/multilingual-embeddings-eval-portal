NY regulators set Lilco restructuring hearings . The New York State Public Service Commission said Tuesday has scheduled a series of open consumer education forums and public statement hearings next week to seek consumer views on the proposed merger , restructuring and rate plans of Long Island Lighting Co and Brooklyn Union Gas Co . The commission said it will will decide whether to approve the plan following review of the information presented at evidentiary and public statement hearings . Separately , it noted , Lilco is pursuing other restructuring activities with the Long Island Power Authority that may introduce additional restructuring and rate changes . On March 13 , Lilco and Brooklyn Union filed a merger proposal with the commission to authorize the transfer of ownership of common stock from public shareholders of both companies to an unregulated holding company . The natural gas and electric operations would become subsidiaries of the holding company , and their rates would continue to be regulated by the commission , it noted . The proposal also seeks modifications of Brooklyn Union ' s multi - year gas rate plan and amendments to its holding company agreement approved by the commission on September 25 , 1996 . The amendments would relax certain holding company provisions , the regulators said . The proposal contemplates the formation of a corporate services subsidiary that would provide administrative and management services that are now being provided by the two companies , the commission added . It said the meetings begin on May 27 with two sessions at Hofstra Law School in Hempstead , N . Y . , AT 1300 EDT / 1700 GMT and 1800 EDT / 2200 GMT . In both cases , the public statement hearing begins an hour and a half later . On May 28 , hearings will be held in the Suffolk Legislative Auditorium in Riverhead at 1100 EDT / 1500 GMT in the Huntington Towsn Hall at 1800 EDT . On May 29 , the first session will be in the Brooklyn Borough Hall at 1300 EDT and the second in Queens Borough Hall at 1800 EDT . ( ( - - New York Newsdesk 212 - 859 - 1610 . ) )

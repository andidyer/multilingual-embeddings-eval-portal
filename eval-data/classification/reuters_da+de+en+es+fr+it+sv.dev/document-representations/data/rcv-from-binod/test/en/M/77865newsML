ZIMBABWE DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED ON HARD UNITS . The Zimbabwe dollar ended Thursday ' s session weaker against the U . S . dollar and pound sterling but was quoted firmer on the mark and the rand , dealers said . " There were lots of payments - - mostly loan repayments for the third quarter ( of the year ) - - going out and the dollar lost another cent from where it was in the morning , " one dealer said . " We didn ' t see the central bank coming in . Probably because the fall was not an alarming one , and anyway the dollar is rather overvalued at the moment , " he added . At Thursday ' s close , the local unit was quoted at 10 . 3300 / 3500 against the U . S . dollar from Wednesday ' s 10 . 3100 / 3300 and slipped to 16 . 1300 / 1700 from 16 . 1250 / 1640 against sterling .

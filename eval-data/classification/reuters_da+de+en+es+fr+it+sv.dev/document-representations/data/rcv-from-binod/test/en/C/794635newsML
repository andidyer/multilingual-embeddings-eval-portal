RESEARCH ALERT - MERRILL RATES ENGRO BUY . Engro Chemical Pakistan Ltd is the best buy among fertiliser stocks in Pakistan , according to a sectoral report by Merrill Lynch received on Tuesday . " Although nine fertiliser units are currently in operation , the largest two , Fauji Fertiliser Company and Engro Chemical Pakistan Ltd , account for more than 48 percent of installed capacity , which indicates the oligopolistic structure of the industry , " the report said . " In Merrill Lynch ' s opinion , Engro is the best buy in the fertiliser sector in Pakistan , " analyst Mustafa Mohsin told Reuters on Tuesday . " Because of our conservative outlook on urea price increases , we favour the growth plus income stock of Engro Chemical Pakistan Ltd over the income stock of Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd , " he said . The report added : " In our view , Engro scores higher points than Fauji because of its greater reliance on volume rather than on price growth . Furthermore , Engro seems to outshine the latter in growth in shareholder value , " it said . " We rank Engro at the top of our list because it offers growth and income potential to shareholders . " On Monday , Engro ' s share price closed 3 . 00 rupees down to 168 and Fauji Fertiliser ' s share price ended 2 . 00 rupees lower at 93 at the Karachi Stock Exchange . The Merrill Lynch report said that after " halcyon years " of handsome profits , extra capacity coming onstream meant that supply was likely to temporarily outstrip local demand . However , in the longer term demand for fertilisers was set to grow five to six percent annually to match Pakistan ' s growing demand for food to feed roughly four million new mouths a year . " We suggest that investors look beyond the sluggish fertiliser demand growth in the first half of 1997 to a longer - term perspective that is expected to offer rapid creation of shareholder value , " the report said . It said the fertiliser industry played a vital role in Pakistan , where agriculture accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product and the population is growing 2 . 9 percent a year , compared to 2 . 2 percent in India and 2 . 4 percent in Egypt . - - Karachi Newsroom ( 9221 ) 5685192 ; Fax ( 9221 ) 5673428

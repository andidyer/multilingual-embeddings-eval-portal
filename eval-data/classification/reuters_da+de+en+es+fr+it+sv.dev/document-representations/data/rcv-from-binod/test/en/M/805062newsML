UK natural gas unchanged in thin , dull conditions . UK natural gas prices were unchanged in extremely thin conditions on Monday , traders and brokers said , with only a handful of trades done over the whole day . " It ' s been a quiet Monday , though this one seems even quieter than most , " a trader said . Another added that although Monday had been " a desperate day " , it followed an eventful two weeks with large volumes done especially in October and November , and there were hopes that volumes could recover again . But there was no sign of a recovery in activity yet . " It ' s been a warm weekend and there ' s not too much enthusiasm in the market , " a dealer said . Another trader concentrating on the short term market said the lack of volatility in prices had made short term trading difficult . Other players said that several dealers claimed to have traded their positions for the slack holiday period and had no need to trade at present . While the OTC market was quiet and dull , the IPE futures contract saw 200 lots traded at mixed prices , with the balance of the month contract trading for the first time at 9 . 00 pence a therm . - - Sebastian Alison , London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 6412

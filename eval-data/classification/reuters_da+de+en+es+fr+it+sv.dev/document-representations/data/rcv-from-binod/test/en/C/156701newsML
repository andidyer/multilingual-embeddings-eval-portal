Bankrupt Chinese firm sold for $ 58 million - paper . A bankrupt Chinese state - owned firm has been sold at auction for 486 million yuan ( $ 58 . 5 million ) , an edition of Shanghai ' s Youth Daily available in Beijing said on Thursday . The Shanxi Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory in the northern province of Shanxi was bought by the Shanxi - based Taiyuan Cotton Textile State Asset Operating Co last Friday , said the October 28 edition of the newspaper . The initial offering price for Shanxi Textile was 550 million yuan but that was lowered to 486 million yuan during bargaining at the auction , the newspaper said . Taiyuan Cotton had beaten out three other potential buyers to acquire Shanxi Textile , it said . The newspaper did not give the reasons for Shanxi Textile ' s bankruptcy . " This company will be revitalised within a very short time , " it quoted Xue Junming of Taiyuan Cotton ' s board of directors as saying . Taiyuan Cotton aimed to turn the textile plant ' s performance around next year , Xue said , adding that the firm also hoped to form limited responsibility operating companies . The huge Shanxi Textile complex , originally one of China ' s 500 largest industrial firms , covered more than 416 , 000 square metres ( 1 . 36 million square feet ) and had more than 94 , 000 spindles and 2 , 200 looms , it said . China has an estimated 100 , 000 state firms , 40 percent of which official figures say have chronic debt . An additional 30 percent are running at a loss . Beijing has been slow to reform or auction bankrupt state enterprises for fear that mass unemployment and the end of cradle - to - grave welfare services could spark social unrest .

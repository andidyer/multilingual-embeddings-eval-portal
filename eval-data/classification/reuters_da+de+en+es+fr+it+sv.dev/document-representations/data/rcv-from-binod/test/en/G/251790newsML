Interior minister sacked after street protests . Croatia ' s Interior Minister Ivan Jarnjak was dismissed on Thursday , apparently the victim of his failure to suppress mass street protests in November . The state news agency HINA quoted the secretary of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) Ivan Valent as saying " Jarnjak was transferred to another duty that would help him devote more time to HDZ party activities . " The independent daily Novi List said Jarnjak had already been sacked on Tuesday for reasons including his failure to stop the November demonstrations . Valent said the most serious candidate to replace Jarnjak was Iven Penic , current minister of privatisation . Some 100 , 000 people gathered in Zagreb ' s main square on November 21 to protest against the HDZ government ' s attempt to shut down the popular independent Radio 101 . Organisers gave notice of the rally to the police , who made no attempts to prevent it . Police patrols kept a low profile throughout the one - hour protest . The sacking came after president Franjo Tudjman criticized " some ministers " for underestimating the gravity of the situation during a HDZ congress on Saturday . Jarnjak was thought to be a prominent member of the moderate wing of the nationalist ruling party . He became interior minister in 1992 . Novi List also said six of Jarnjak ' s assistants offered to resign too . No goverment officials were available for comment .

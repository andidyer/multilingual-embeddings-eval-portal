' s health facilities revenue bonds ( Tockwotton Home Issue ) , series 1996 , are rated ' BBB ' by Fitch Investors Service . The bonds are expected to be sold during the week of Dec . 2 through negotiation by A . G . Edwards & Sons , Inc . The rating is supported by Tockwotton ' s excellent liquidity position , improving occupancy , sound financial oversight and strong legal covenants that provide above average bondholder protection . Key to Tockwotton ' s long - term viability is its effective management of cash reserves . Steadily improving financial performance , accomplished through a reduction in operating costs , and an increase in occupancy for the assisted living units ( ALUs ) has generated a strong cash and investment position that will equate to 1 , 246 days cash on hand upon refunding of the outstanding series 1992 issue - - providing a pro forma cushion ratio of 22 . 5 times ( x ) and cash to debt of 220 % . Historical pro forma maximum annual debt service ( MADS ) coverage for the fiscal year ended Dec . 31 , 1995 was a solid 2 . 1x , increasing to 3 . 3x as of Sept . 30 , 1996 . Although greatly improved , Tockwotton is projecting a $ 340 , 000 loss from operations for 1996 . An increasing Medicaid load as a proportion of total revenues could limit further reductions to this operating deficit . A heavy reliance on investment income to fund this shortfall is a concern .

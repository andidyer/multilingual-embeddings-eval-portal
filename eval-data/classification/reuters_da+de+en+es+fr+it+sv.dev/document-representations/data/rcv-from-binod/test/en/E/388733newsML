FOCUS - UK retail sales jump , reopening rate debate . British retail sales bounced back smartly last month , official figures showed on Wednesday , casting doubt on the government ' s view that consumer spending had slackened and interest rates should stay on hold . The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said high street sales rose 0 . 6 percent in January and 4 . 6 percent in the year to January , the highest year - on - year rise since March 1989 and well above market expectations . The government immediately played down comments that spending was growing too fast and was placing the tough 2 . 5 percent inflation target in jeopardy . " The in - control recovery continues . High street sales remain on a healthy upward path , " said Economic Secretary to the Treasury Angela Knight . She said there were few signs of any sort of inflationary pressures in the pipeline , and the strength of the pound would help keep inflation low . The surprise jump in high street sales followed a disappointing run - up to Christmas where sales actually fell 0 . 8 percent during December . Minutes from the January 15 monthly monetary meeting , also released on Wednesday , showed Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke used softer retail survey evidence for this period to justify his decision to leave rates on hold at six percent . He said the retail surveys , which provide useful clues early on the contents of official data , were a sign strong domestic demand may have eased . " Although consumption was still strong , early indicators from the December CBI distributive trades survey and the British Retail Consortium suggested that the rate of growth may have eased off somewhat , " the minutes quoted Clarke as saying . Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George disagreed and called for a quarter point rate rise immediately . " The Bank still thought it was likely that a monetary tightening of half a percent would be needed fairly soon to moderate the growth of domestic demand . The Bank was not pressing the case at this point . But the Bank did strongly recommend a quarter percent rise this month . " But Clarke overruled him , saying that as well as signs domestic demand were easing , the pound ' s strength would help keep inflationary pressures in check . " The Chancellor said he did not believe that enough account had been taken of the strength of the exchange rate , " the minutes said . The ruling Conservatives are eager to make it through to the election without having to sanction a politically unpopular rate rise . The election must be held by May and most economists believe Clarke can now get away with it . " Clarke is home and dry until the election , " said Kevin Gardiner , UK economist at Morgan Stanley . " But talk of slowing high street spending is massively overdone . We , and the Treasury , forecast consumer spending will rise 4 . 25 percent in 1997 . Here is the first snapshot of the year and it is up 4 . 6 percent on an annual basis . " Other economists said consumer spending was likely to gather more speed later this year as tax cuts , announced in the November budget , hit pay packets in April . " The Bank will probably have much more ammunition to repeat the recommendation that rates need to be raised by a quarter point if the government is to meet its inflation target , " said Andrew Cates , UK economist at UBS .

U . S . stocks settle into ranges at lower levels . Wall Street stocks stood modestly lower in late afternoon on Friday , holding to tight ranges after recouping the majority of their early - session losses . The Dow industrials were off about 14 points at 7316 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 10 points at 1393 . Volatility and volume both appeared to dwindle in the late stages of the session , although some analysts thought stocks might encounter at least one more wave of selling after Intel Corp ' s early morning warning regarding its second quarter results . " It wouldn ' t surprise me to see a little more sloppy activity , " said Greg Nie , technical analyst at EVEREN Securities . " I ' m somewhat skeptical that all the nervous selling has been taken care of . " ( ( - - Wall Street desk , 212 - 859 - 1730 ) )

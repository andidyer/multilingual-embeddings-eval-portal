LME watches copper with " usual keen interest " - CEO . The London Metal Exchange is keeping its usual close watch on the LME copper market , LME chief executive David King said on Wednesday . " The LME are watching the copper market with their usual keen interest , " he said . King was also asked if the LME was considering lifting the exchange ' s one percent limit on the cost of borrowing copper for one day and replied " No . " The LME imposed the one percent limit , which , based on Wednesday ' s prices , equates to about $ 24 a tonne , in May when spreads were high despite LME stocks above 300 , 000 tonnes . Some traders have expressed concern about the limit in recent days , arguing that with stocks at six - year lows below 100 , 000 tonnes , it should be lifted . Although current spreads are well below the limit , supply tightness could send them spiralling higher , they say . " The limit was put on when stocks were 300 , 000 tonnes or so , and so was probably justified , " a senior trader said on Tuesday . " But now stocks are only 100 , 000 tonnes , it needs to be lifted . This trader said the limit favoured short position holders , a majority from the speculative community . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8057

Amid a dearth of fresh factors , traders were waiting for the Bank of Japan ' s quarterly economic outlook on Thursday . In its last outlook issued in April , the BOJ said the Japanese economy remained on a recovery trend despite fluctuations caused by a consumption tax increase on April 1 . The central bank also said in April that Japan ' s net exports were likely to continue rising , partly due to the yen ' s depreciation since mid - 1995 . " If the central bank presents a slightly positive outlook for the economy ( in its quarterly report ) , the Euroyen might ease to around 98 . 95 , " said a city bank trader . The Euroyen market , however , has recently been slow to respond to negative factors , so any possible dip on the BOJ report might be temporary , traders said . March Euroyen ended on Tuesday at 99 . 02 , the top of the day ' s 98 . 99 - to - 99 . 02 range , on turnover of 14 , 156 contracts . In the interest rate swap ( IRS ) market , a few Japanese banks paid one - year fixed interest rates in an otherwise quiet market , traders said . The one - year IRS was quoted at 0 . 79 / 0 . 83 percent at 0630 GMT , down from Friday ' s 0 . 80 / 0 . 84 percent . The BOJ left the market with a 200 billion yen surplus in its regular money market operation on Tuesday , in order to fend off upward pressure on rates in the short end of the market . The call rate firmed slightly , however , to 0 . 50 - 0 . 51 percent from Friday ' s 0 . 49 percent . Traders expect accomodative operations by the BOJ to continue on Wednesday . - - - Yoshiko Mori , Tokyo Treasury Desk + 81 - 3 - 3432 - 8676

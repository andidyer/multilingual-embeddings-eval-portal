" A couple of hours later , however , many of the options were cancelled simultaneously , with most of most of the cancellations coming from banks within the Telekom syndicate , a Rabobank board spokesman said in a statement . A spokesman for Deutsche Telekom was not immediately available for comment . Rabobank said that it was not accusing Deutsche Telekom or any of the banks in the syndicate for the cancellation of the option orders . But a spokesman for the Rabobank board added : " Rabobank views this practice as unusual hindrance of our ability to do business . " As Rabobank was not a member of the Telekom consortium , it was under no obligation not to issue Telekom options during the current book - building phase which goes on until the weekend after next , the board said . Deutsche Bank , one of the lead sponsors in the Telekom sell - off , on Friday issued options on Deutsche Telekom , which it later withdrew as it was told that the flotation contract prevented it from issued such options .

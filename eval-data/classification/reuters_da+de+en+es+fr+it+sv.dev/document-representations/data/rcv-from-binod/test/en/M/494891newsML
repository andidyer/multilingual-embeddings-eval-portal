USWC crudes up with WTI , buyers sidelined by rumor . U . S . West Coast crude prices rose with West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) Monday while differentials stayed flat as traders tried to find out if a sale of Alaskan crude went unrecorded last week . Several West Coast crude traders heard a cargo of Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) crude sold at a larger discount than the $ 1 . 05 done Friday . BP , the main ANS producer , denied it sold the cargo . Buyers also waited to see if Canadian crude would be diverted West following the shutdown of major pipelines into the Midwest states .

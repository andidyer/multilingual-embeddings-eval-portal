Bad weather blocks Everest search for climbers . Bad weather prevented a search for five mountaineers missing since last week on the northern face of Mount Everest , a member of a Kazakh team said on Monday . " Because of bad weather we could not organise a search , " said Vladimir Frolov , a member of a Kazakh military expedition to the 8 , 848 - metre ( 29 , 028 ft ) peak , who arrived in Kathmandu on Monday . A 45 - year - old member of the expedition , Alexander Torochin , 45 , was killed while descending to a lower camp after failing to make it to the summit last week , climbers said . Two others from the same team , Nikolai Chevtchenko , 52 , a climbing instructor and Ivan Plotaikov , 36 , an engineer , were missing on their way down from the summit on the Chinese side of the mountain , they said . Peter Kowalzik , a 29 - year - old German banker from Ludwigshafen climbing on his own , and a Nepali sherpa guide with an expedition from North Ossetia , were also missing on the same side , they added . Earlier reports from New Zealand quoted a spokeswoman of Adventure Consultants as saying that up to seven people were believed to be dead on the Tibetan side of the mountain . Frolov told Reuters that Torochin died while descending in bad weather after failing to reach the summit on May 7 . His body was found by sherpas . A 24 - year old student from Almaty , Frolov suffered from frost bite while descending from the Everest summit with three others from the team last week . The latest incidents on the world ' s highest peak come a year and a day after eight climbers from three expeditions , including noted New Zealand climber Rob Hall , perished in treacherous weather on the mountain . The majority of climbers seeking to conquer Everest this season are located on the southern side of the mountain , waiting in base camps for the storm to clear .

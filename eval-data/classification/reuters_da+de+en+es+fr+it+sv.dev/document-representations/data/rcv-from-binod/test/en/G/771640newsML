SOCCER - VOLKSWAGEN MOVES UP A GEAR WITH WOLFSBURG . The carmaker that brought the world the Polo and the Golf turns to top level soccer on Saturday when the German Bundesliga season starts in earnest . Volkswagen AG , the largest car manufacturer in Europe , is moving up a gear and joining the big league of sports sponsorship through their newly - promoted hometown team of Wolfsburg , entering the top flight for the first time . The deal is a strictly local affair , unlike other carmakers whose names adorn the shirts of top - name European soccer teams - - such as Opel at Bayern Munich and AC Milan . " This is a backyard sponsorship deal that has turned out to be incredibly productive , " said Klaus Kocks , a Volkswagen management board member in charge of corporate communications . Volkswagen , who have supported the team for decades , are paying an estimated three million marks ( $ 1 . 6 million ) to keep their logo on the team ' s green and white shirts . " Anyone who doubts such sponsoring doesn ' t work should remember that Opel for years was viewed as a car for old people who even wore hats inside cars , " said Peter Strahlendorf , publisher of a German magazine on marketing and advertising . " Now it is a sportier model and their market share has certainly risen . "

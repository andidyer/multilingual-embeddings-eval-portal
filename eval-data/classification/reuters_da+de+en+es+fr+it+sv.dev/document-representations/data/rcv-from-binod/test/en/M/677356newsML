INSIGHT - Bunds to keep ahead of 101 . 00 . September Bunds are likely to pull ahead from current levels on Friday , technical analysts said . " The Bund future is testing support , but has probably seen its lows for the day , " said Elli Gifford , independent technical analyst near Cambridge . " The figure ( 101 . 00 ) should hold it on a closing basis , " she added . September Bunds were trading at 101 . 06 at 0753 GMT , nine basis points above the 100 . 97 close and four basis points above the session low of 101 . 02 . But Bunds do not have far to run on Friday , Gifford said . " The contract runs into trouble if it gets as high as 101 . 25 , as there are a couple of resistance points from previous lows near there . " September Bunds hit lows of 101 . 22 on June 13 and June 17 , daily charts show . Brenda Sullivan and Elizabeth Miller of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell also put 101 . 25 as a resistance level , with 101 . 11 as initial resistance and 101 . 58 as a subsequent target . But Sullivan and Miller were more bearish on the contract . " September Bunds were rejected from 101 . 59 resistance on Thursday , tumbling toward 100 . 90 at the close . This activity left a bearish ' outside ' day on the daily plot , which combined with the confirmed bearish crossover in daily stochastics leaves 100 . 60 to come under fire , " they said in a research note . " Key support to watch is at the 100 . 30 region . A break will allow a retreat to 99 . 78 ( trendline from early April ) , then the 99 . 20 retracement level . " Gifford found support at 100 . 50 and 100 . 00 if 101 . 00 breaks . Beyond 101 . 25 , hourly charts throw up several resistance levels up to the contract high of 101 . 88 reached on Tuesday , she said . September Euromarks were unchanged at 96 . 82 . A break of96 . 85 would put 96 . 88 wave extension resistance in view , Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said .

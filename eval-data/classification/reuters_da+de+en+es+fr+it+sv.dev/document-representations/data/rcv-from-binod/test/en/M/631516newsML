Funds see France oversold after left victory . Fund managers are cautious about French markets after the combined left ' s resounding election victory , but see the sharp early drop in equities as an overreaction . They told Reuters on Monday that the Socialists , who will depend on the support of Communists to govern , will likely implement policy detrimental to recovering sectors like financial institutions but helpful to some consumer and export stocks . " The pessimism in stocks is overdone , " said Tony Robinson , head of equities at Lombard Odier . " The positive underlying economics will win through in the end . " French stocks fell steeply in early trading Monday - down almost 10 percent from a week ago - but recovered slightly in late morning trading . " The banking sector will be hurt because restructuring will be very , very difficult , " said Michel Poletti , investment strategist at Societe Generale Asset Management in Paris . French banks , whose current programme of rationalisation will cost thousands of jobs , are vulnerable to government interference , fund managers said . Societe Generale is cautious for French market ' s immediate prospects but believes that medium - term fundamentals remain positive . " It is likely we will reduce the weight of France ( in the portfolio ) , but not dramatically , " Poletti said . Consumer spending - related stocks may stand to gain under the left , fund managers said . " If you have a bias towards social spending , consumer stocks will be more in favour , " said Michael Hughes , chief economist at BZW . Fund managers pointed to consumer stocks , especially ones with strong overseas exposure such as LVMH , as potential strong performers . " This won ' t kill off growth , " said Gary Dugan , head of equity market strategy at JP Morgan Securities . But sentiment is generally negative on French bonds , with the left ' s victory regarded as increasing the possibility of a soft euro single currency . " If there is a softening of the euro you are looking at much steeper yield curves in the European block , " Hughes said . " Arguably it has greater implications for Europe as a whole than for France . " If monetary union goes ahead on a fiscally looser basis , Hughes sees the European central bank forced to take a more stringent monetary policy stance in compensation . " The bond shake - out has not been completed , " Hughes said . Negative sentiment on French bonds could spill over to Germany , according to Shaun Roche , investment strategist at ING Barings . " The convergence process will happen against the backdrop of higher bund yields , " Roche said . " With Maatricht criteria so finely balanced right now , there is no way they can go trough with a 700 , 000 job creation policy unless they delay EMU , " said Robinson . As a result several fund managers say they have taken defensive strategies towards European currencies , with dollars and sterling used as hedges .

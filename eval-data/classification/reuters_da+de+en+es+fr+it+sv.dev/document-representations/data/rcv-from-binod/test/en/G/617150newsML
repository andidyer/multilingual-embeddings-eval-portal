NATO and Russia say pact ends division of Europe . NATO and Russia signed an historic accord on a new security relationship on Tuesday , formally ending the Cold War and clearing the way for the alliance to expand eastwards without triggering renewed East - West tensions . NATO leaders gathered in Paris hailed the " Founding Act on Mutual Cooperation " as offering the prospect of a united Europe after more than half a century of bitter division . Hardly was the ink dry , when an upbeat Russian President Boris Yeltsin immediately sought to inaugurate the new era of cooperation with a surprise announcement Russia would no longer target nuclear missiles at NATO states . Yeltsin ' s offer initially puzzled Western leaders by its pledge to remove warheads from missiles aimed at NATO , but - - after a flurry of diplomatic activity - - was widely praised as a goodwill gesture of huge symbolic importance . French President Jacques Chirac , host of a special summit to sign the deal , told his guests the NATO - Russia pact swept away " the last remnants of the Cold War " and the legacy of the Yalta agreement which carved up Europe at the end of World War Two . " We will be turning the page on half a century of misunderstanding , of confrontation , of division on our continent , " he said in an opening address to the lavish ceremony in the banqueting room of the ornate presidential Elysee Palace . " The Paris accord does not shift the divisions created in Yalta . It does away with them once and for all , " Chirac said in his opening address . U . S . President Bill Clinton said the pact realised the long - sought goal of " a peaceful , democratic , undivided Europe " . " In the twilight of the 20th century , we look forward toward a new century with a new Russia and a new NATO , working together in a new Europe of unlimited possibility , " he told the summit . Yeltsin then stood up and made his impromptu statement on nuclear missiles . " I have taken a decision today . Everything that is aimed at countries present here , all of those weapons , are going to have their warheads removed , " Yeltsin said to applause from the 16 leaders of the military shield which protected the West from the now - defunct Soviet Union . The offer almost stole the show at the event in a French capital basking in warm spring sunshine . " The president means that the warheads will not be targeted at the states which have signed the ( NATO - Russia ) Founding Act , " Yeltsin ' s spokesman , Sergei Yastrzhembsky , later told reporters . " In future , the situation is possible when the warheads will be dismantled , " Yastrzhembsky said . " I think , judging by everything , this initiative was triggered by the atmosphere of goodwill and welcome which dominates the summit . " The United States and Russia had previously agreed in arms control talks no longer to target each other ' s cities , but Yeltsin ' s decision appeared to go further and include the entire territory of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) . A NATO official said clarification of what Yeltsin meant was a perfect topic of debate within a NATO - Russia Council created by the security pact and was in keeping with the happy spirit of the ceremony . " Today , we can say the Cold War has definitively come to an end , " said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , a strong supporter of the alliance ' s plans to expand eastwards , said the security accord was of " far - reaching significance . . . ( coming ) at the end of a century which has seen so much blood , tears and suffering " . The accord creates a NATO - Russia council for consultation on European security and enshrines close military and political cooperation between the former enemies , giving Russia a voice , but not a veto , in allied decisions . The deal clears the way for NATO to invite new members to join the alliance at a special summit in Madrid in July . Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic are considered the most likely candidates to join in the first wave of enlargement , but NATO stressed on Tuesday the alliance had still made no decision and the door would stay open anyway . Initial reaction to the deal from countries wishing to join the alliance was positive . Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski , attending a regional summit in Tallinn , capital of Estonia , said the accord would set the stage for further growth of the alliance . Ukraine does not wish to join the alliance but wants a special cooperation treaty with NATO . The Balts are desperate for membership but their entry is seen as highly unlikely given very strong Russian objections . Kwasniewski had some words of comfort for the Balts , saying the NATO - Russia pact set the groundwork for more new members . " This document is the formula to open the process of NATO enlargement , " he told a news conference .

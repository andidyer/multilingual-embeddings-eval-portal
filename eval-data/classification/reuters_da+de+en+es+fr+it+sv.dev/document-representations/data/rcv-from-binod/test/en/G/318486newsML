Europe ' s poorest nation hit by savings crisis . Europe ' s poorest country has been hit by a wave of protests over collapsing pyramid investment schemes . Thousands of people have lost what in Albania amounts to huge amounts of money . Police wielding batons on Sunday broke up a big demonstration led by opposition leaders who accuse the conservative Democratic Party government of President Sali Berisha of failing to action against the schemes . POPULATION : 3 . 4 million , the average age is 25 . The people are primarily Moslem , other religions include Orthodox Christian and Roman Catholic . Religious worship , banned in 1967 , was made legal again in 1990 . AREA : 28 , 748 sq km ( 11 , 101 sq miles ) . Much of Albania is mountainous . It is bounded by the Adriatic Sea to the west , Macedonia to the east , Yugoslavia to the north and east and Greece to the south . POLITICS : Albania is a unicameral parliamentary democracy . Its legislature has 140 seats . Deputies are elected in 115 constituencies on a first - past - the - post system with the remaining 25 seats allocated on a proportional basis . The president is elected by parliament . Berisha ' s mandate expires this year . MODERN HISTORY : Albania gained independence in 1912 after 450 years of Turkish rule . It became a monarchy in 1928 under King Zog , who fled after fascist Italy occupied Albania in 1939 . Albania was later occupied by Nazi Germany and liberated by communist - led partisans in 1944 . After a year of interim rule , Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha came to power when a communist - dominated parliament was elected in 1945 and a People ' s Republic was proclaimed in 1946 . Hoxha led a harsh regime for 40 years until his death in 1985 , isolating his state under a policy of self - reliance . Relations with Moscow were ruptured in 1961 and ties with China cut in 1978 . Hoxha was succeeded in 1985 by Ramiz Alia , who cautiously opened the country to the outside world . Popular turmoil and student unrest prompted the legalisation of opposition parties . The communist party won Albania ' s first multi - party elections in March 1991 and changed its name to the Socialist Party . But its authority faded as Albania grappled with the birth pains of a market economy and political pluralism . Dozens were killed in food riots during the run - up to the second free elections in March 1992 . The Democratic Party won a landslide victory over the ex - communists . Berisha , a former heart surgeon , became Albania ' s first non - communist president in April 1992 . International observers criticised the conduct of a general election last May , boycotted by most of the opposition parties who accused the Democrats of rigging the vote . Berisha ' s party won 122 seats in the 140 - member parliament . The opposition refuses to take up the handful of seats it was allocated in the chamber . Berisha has also come in for criticism from international human rights groups following the jailing of Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano in 1994 on charges of corruption . ECONOMY : The economy is the continent ' s poorest but growth , officially estimated at about 10 percent last year , outstrips that of any other European nation . Still , living standards remain low with average monthly wages barely above $ 65 . Tight monetary and fiscal policies have reduced inflation to a low of six percent in 1995 , from as much as 237 percent in 1992 , but inflation crept up again to about 17 percent last year . Registered unemployment hovers around 20 percent . Industrial recovery remains hampered by a desperate lack of working capital , a shaky banking system and obscure legal structures . Foreign investment is minimal , the economy remains dependent on foreign aid and remissions from some 400 , 000 Albanians living abroad , estimated at $ 380 million per year . Main industries include mining , agricultural product processing , textiles , oil products and cement . DEFENCE : Army - 60 , 000 men ( 20 , 000 conscripts ) . Navy - 2 , 500 ( 1 , 000 conscripts ) . Air Force - 10 , 000 ( 1 , 800 conscripts ) . ( source : The Military Balance 1995 / 96 , International Institute of Strategic Studies ) .

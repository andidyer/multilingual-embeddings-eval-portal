About $ 360 million of the charges will be taken in in the third quarter , with the balance in the fourth quarter . " Clearly we ' ve had problems in our international beverage business , " Enrico said . " But I believe we ' re moving to fix them quickly and get ourselves on a sound strategic footing . " The company plans to refocus on its core businesses of Pepsi - Cola beverage products , Taco Bell , Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and Frito - Lay snacks , Enrico said in a statement . But it will also expand its programme of selling company - owned Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants to franchisees , and will offer Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises staring next year .

COALITION SEEKS TO STOP PROTECTION OF US UTILITIES . An odd coalition of free market , consumer and green groups Thursday launched a campaign to stop state regulators and the U . S . government from saving lumbering utilities in the move to an open power market . The groups acknowledged they were getting into the game late , but said states that are deregulating utility monopolies should not protect uncompetitive companies by allowing them to recover so - called stranded costs as their customers shift to other power suppliers . " A consumer bailout of these poorly - managed utilities is phony competition , " Anna Aurelio , staff scientist for U . S . Public Interest Research Group , said at a news conference . Utilities and analysts have estimated the whole industry ' s stranded costs - - the value of assets that might become unprofitable in an open market - - at $ 200 billion . Consumer groups fear that utilities ' captive customers , residential power consumers , will end up covering those costs in their rates , while bigger customers who move to other suppliers and utility shareholders get off the hook . California ' s state government voted to allow utilites to recover $ 28 billion in stranded costs , which regulators must now approve before the state opens its market in 1998 , said Scott Denman , executive director of the anti - nuclear group Safe Energy Communication Council . The eight groups in the coalition , ranging from the arch - conservative Heritage Foundation to the environmental group Friends of the Earth , said the powerful utilities and big manufacturers had dominated the electric deregulation debate , while residential consumers had not been heard . " It ' s like going up against Moby Dick with a rowboat and tartar sauce , " said Crews . The groups said they will be working separately to educate consumers about the potential costs that might hit them . Consumer groups in California , Pennsylvania and Massachusetts , the states moving most rapidly toward open power markets , have begun battling the states ' plans to allow utilities to recover their stranded costs . The Edison Electric Institute , which represents investor - owned utilities , said that other industries that had been deregulated , including railroads , arilines and natural gas , had been protected in the transition to competition . The association pointed to regulators ' statements that it would be unfair to break up monopolies without protecting investments that they made under the old rules of regulated markets . - - Sonali Paul , ( 202 ) 898 8320

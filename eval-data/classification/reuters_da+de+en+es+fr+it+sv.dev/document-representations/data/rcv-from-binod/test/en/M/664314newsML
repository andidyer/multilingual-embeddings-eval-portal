Rumours rattle Israel ' s forex mkt , shekel up . The Israeli shekel strengthened beyond its trading band early on Monday on rumours Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would announce a widening of the band , dealers said . Dealers said the bank of Israel had not yet intervened , but was expected to do so before the end of trading . Netanyahu is due to speak this evening at an economic conference in the seaside town of Caesarea . " There are rumours Netanyahu will announce a widening of the band and further liberalisation of the foreign currency markets , " a dealer at United Mizrahi Bank said . The shekel , pegged to a basket of foreign currencies , is allowed to trade in a band of seven percent above or below a diagonal slope designed to depreciate the Israeli currency at about six percent a year . Dealers said the market was active on Monday morning amid heavy conversions of foreign currency , and the basket ' s rate slipped outside the band to 7 . 05 - 7 . 1 percent below the diagonal . The basket was trading 3 . 7020 shekels against Friday ' s representative rate of 3 . 7048 midesession . The dollar was trading little changed from Friday ' s 3 . 4130 shekels as the US currency gained overseas . High interest rates have buoyed the shekel , forcing the central bank to intervene heavily in recent months to prevent the currency from appreciating beyond its trading band . Finance Minister Dan Meridor opposes a widening of the trading band , but the Bank of Israel has urged a widening of the band . Speaking to reporters at Caesarea on Monday , Bank of Israel governor Jacob Frenkel said in response to a question on whether a decision had been taken on widening the band : " That ' s not an issue we need to decide . We are now talking about a variety of measures , all of which are consistent with increasing the freedom of Israelis and investors to operate in the economy , particularly in the area of foreign currency liberalisation . " In this regard , I believe that the prime minister , the finance minister and myself are getting close to a decision " He would not comment on the timetable . - - Tel Aviv newsroom : 972 - 3 - 537 - 2211 x233

Peru ' s Fujimori to meet Clinton and Hashimoto . President Alberto Fujimori will not apologise to Japan over controversial police actions at the besieged Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima nor seek approval for a military assault , senior government sources said on Thursday . Fujimori will meet Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Toronto on Saturday to discuss the deadlocked 44 - day hostage crisis and then travel to Washington the following day for similar talks with President Bill Clinton . He is scheduled to fly from Lima to Toronto aboard the presidential jet around midnight local time ( 0500 GMT ) , officials said . Senior government sources , all speaking on condition of anonymity , insisted Fujmori would not apologise to Hashimoto for provocative police tactics at the siege site , which have worried Tokyo , nor seek his approval for a military assault . They said in his meeting with Clinton , Fujimori planned to thank him for Washington ' s strong backing during the standoff with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels holding 72 hostages . Hashimoto said on Thursday the weekend summit would confirm Tokyo and Lima ' s joint strategy of not " caving in to terrorism . " But he is likely to temper that tough talk with a plea that Lima avoid steps that could prompt the Marxist rebels to harm their hostages , who include two dozen Japanese , officials said . " The meeting is not meddling with the Peruvian government , but is a discussion , " government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said . Fujimori has not commented publicly on the meeting , but his chief crisis negotiator , Domingo Palermo , described it as a joint evaluation of " strategy set out to reach a solution . " Palermo told a news conference the meeting also " looks to make possible the carrying out of operative aspects " to end the crisis . As attention focused on the Toronto meeting , police outside the residence kept up their war of nerves against about 15 heavily armed rebels inside the mined compound . A recording of martial music with the roar of aircraft in the background was blasted at the site around 1 a . m . local time and again soon after dawn . It created the impression helicopters and planes were approaching the fortified compound , witnesses said . Police have played the music periodically for several days to wear down the rebels , but Thursday was the first time they turned on the music during sleeping hours . Scores of policemen took part in a massive show of force in front of the compound on Monday , driving past in an armoured convoy to the tune of the marching music . Some made obscene gestures , provoking a burst of gunfire from the rebels which narrowly missed policemen aboard one vehicle . Hashimoto called earlier this week for Fujimori to exercise caution in the deployment of police at the site to prevent " accidents or incidents . " Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said his country was chosen to host Hashimoto ' s meeting with Fujimori because of its mediating role in the crisis which has been accepted by both sides . Efforts to start talks with the MRTA guerrillas have stalled over the main rebel demand of freedom for about 400 jailed comrades , which Fujimori has refused to discuss . The MRTA rebels originally seized hundreds of guests when they stormed the residence on Dec . 17 during a diplomatic reception . They released most of the captives but kept 72 key people , including Fujimori ' s brother and the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors .

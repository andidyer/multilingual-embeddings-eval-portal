" It ' s continued foreign selling pressure . It ' s really a bear market and people now are looking at the bad side of earnings instead of the good side , " Joey Roxas ( corrects from " Salceda " ) , president at Eagle equities Inc said . Poch Zamora , dealer at Peregrine Securities said that even the Dow ' s phenomenal rise overnight failed to spark interest in the market soured by disappointing first quarter company profits . The Dow ended higher on Tuesday by 179 . 01 points at 6 , 962 . 03 . Foreign selling was prominent as B shares of San Miguel Corp , Manila Electric Co and Ayala Land Inc were being sold during the session . Turnover , however , was lower at 2 . 37 billion pesos compared with 3 . 67 billion the previous session . Helen Alvarez , research head at All Asia Securities said the market may persist in its downslide simply due to a lack of positive news to provide a brake . The stock market will be closed on Thursday to mark the Labor Day and traders said this may have influenced investors to take short positions . - - KATHERINE ESPINA ( 63 2 ) 841 - 8939 Fax 8176267

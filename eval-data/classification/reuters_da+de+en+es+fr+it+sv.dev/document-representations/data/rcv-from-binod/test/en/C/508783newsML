American Airlines drops fuel surcharge . American Airlines is selectively dropping its cargo fuel surcharge effective April 28 in the latest of a series of such moves by airlines around the world . The carrier is scrapping the 10 cent a kg surcharge both ways across the Atlantic and to Latin America but is maintaining it on cross Pacific routes . AA vice - president of sales Mark Najarian said most airlines had maintained the surcharge on Pacific routes because of strong market conditions . U . S . - Asia trade has been so strong that ocean lines have reported backups at U . S . west coast ports in recent weeks , the New York - based Journal of Commerce reported on Monday . American did not have a fuel surcharge as such either domestically or on northbound routes from Latin America , said Najarian adding that fuel prices remain significantly higher than a year ago , but American is dropping the surcharge anyway to remain competitive . With American ' s move , most airlines have dropped their surcharges on the north Atlantic . An exception so far has been British Airways . The surcharges were put into place last November to cope with a major spike in global jet fuel prices . On Latin American routes , American ' s major competitors are carriers like Varig Brazilian , Polar Air Cargo and United Airlines all of which have dropped or are dropping their surcharges said Najarian . April represents the start of the summer airline schedule , with increased levels of flying on the north Atlantic in particular , which means a great deal more cargo space to fill . April also brings a seasonal downturn in cargo traffic on the north Atlantic ahead of the summer shutdowns of manufacturing plants . - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax + 5017

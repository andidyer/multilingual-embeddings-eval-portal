HUNGARY MARCH CENTRAL BUDGET AS EXPECTED - MINISTRY . Hungary ' s central state budget deficit increased substantially in March , but the gap corresponds to the government ' s expectations , the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday . The central state budget deficit widened to 113 . 1 billion forints in March from 46 . 8 billion forints in February , while the deficit target for 1997 is 309 . 7 billion forints . " The central budget is running as expected , " deputy secretary of state Csaba Laszlo told a news conference . The Finance Ministry said the larger than average March deficit was mainly due to the seasonal impact of increased debt service expenditures . Laszlo said he expected the deficit to widen by only 15 to 20 billion forints in April , compared with 66 . 8 billion forints in March . The central state budget is a sub - system of the general government budget , which also includes the social security and government funds . Laszlo said the government funds , which target a total deficit of 14 . 8 billion forints for 1997 , posted a surplus of 13 . 1 billion forints in March . But the social security gap was estimated between 15 and 20 billion forints in March , compared with the 13 . 5 billion target for the whole year , he added . Laszlo said the Finance Ministry was in talks with the social security funds about potential measures to keep the deficit at the target . - - Sandor Peto , Budapest newsroom ( 36 1 ) 327 4040

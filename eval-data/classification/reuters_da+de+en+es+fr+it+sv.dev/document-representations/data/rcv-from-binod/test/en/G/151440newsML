Massachusetts ' brawlin ' Brahmins take off gloves . There were no fatal blows , but a flurry of verbal jabs and an occassional below - the - belt punch as Republican Massachusetts Gov . William Weld challenged incumbent Democrat U . S . Sen . John Kerry in their last debate on Monday night . Police estimated 10 , 000 chanting supporters gathered outside historic Faneuil Hall as inside the two men danced around some questions - - Kerry about the ethics of accepting free housing from lobbyists , Weld about whether he would support Republican North Carolina Sen . Jesse Helms as head of the foreign relations committee . Polls show the pair in a statistical dead heat . Sunday ' s Boston Globe poll had Weld ahead 42 percent to 40 , but Friday ' s Boston Herald showed Kerry ahead 44 percent to 40 . Each poll had a five point margin of error . Asked why , as a two - term incumbent Democrat in a heavily Democratic state , he was not clearly ahead , Kerry replied , " I don ' t think it is dead even . . . My opponent is a Republican . The mask is coming off him now . " Kerry said Weld would support Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole ' s 15 percent tax cut which would cause " massive cuts in Medicare . . . education , transportation and the environment . " But Weld said the reason the race was so close " in a state where President Clinton is far ahead . . . is that people are coming to realize this is a contest between my record and Sen . Kerry ' s record . . . I have cut taxes 15 times in the last six years . . . We increased the number of jobs by 250 , 000 ( in the state . " " When the governor tries to take credit for the jobs , " Kerry replied , " He sounds like the rooster trying to take credit for the sunrise . . . We did that in Washington . I voted for the deficit reduction act in Washington that has given us four years of straight deficit reduction . And the truth is we have created 10 . 5 million jobs . " While Kerry could look out at the audience and see the state ' s Sen . Ted Kennedy and Sen . Christopher Dodd , who is leading the national Democratic effort , there were no Republicans of note in the crowd for Weld . Weld supporters held signs bearing only his name ; Kerry ' s supporters had signs linking him to Clinton . Weld , when asked whether he was more comfortable with President Clinton or House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich , repeated his tax - cutting record adding , " It is true I am a fiscal conservative . I am more moderate or Libertarian on social issues . " Kerry attacked Weld for his crime record , noting that prison stays at the state ' s maximum security prison had gone down from 63 months to 43 months and said , " In fact , governor , I think most of the criminals in this state are less frightened of you than they are of Inspector Clouseau . " The senator responded it was federal legislation he supported that added police to the various municipal forces in the state . " I can ' t believe who I ' m listening to , " Weld replied . " When you were lieutenant governor with ( Gov . ) Mike Dukakis you were letting out murderers on furlough . " It was in the 18th - century hall some 230 years ago that the then colonists railed against the Stamp Tax , which placed a tax on publications and the Sugar Tax , which placed duties on lumber , molasses and rum , as Kerry reminded the crowd , after Weld declined to specify which federal taxes he would cut .

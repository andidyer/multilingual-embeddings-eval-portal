Two drinks every day best for heart - study . People who drink two measures of alcohol a day , five days a week , have the lowest risk of heart attacks , Australian researchers reported on Friday . They said their study proved that , to have health benefits , alcohol must be drunk regularly and in moderate amounts . Patrick McElduff and Annette Dobson of the University of Newcastle in New South Wales took notice of a growing body of studies that show light to moderate drinkers have a lower risk of death from heart disease than heavy drinkers or non - drinkers . But , they complained , the studies did not differentiate between people who had just a few drinks every day and those who had all their drinks in a weekend binge . They wanted to know whether it made any difference if the 14 or so drinks a week for women and 21 drinks a week recommended for men were spread out over a week . McElduff and Dobson studied more than 11 , 500 heart attack sufferers and 6 , 000 people who did not have heart attacks and found the risk of heart attack was lowest among people who drank two measures of alcohol a day . A drink is usually defined as one glass ( 125 ml or 4 oz ) of wine , one beer ( 500 ml or 8 oz ) or 40 ml of spirits . " Risk is lowest among men who report one to four drinks daily on five or six days a week and among women who report one or two drinks daily on five or six days a week , " they wrote in a report in the British Medical Journal . " There was an increased risk of a major coronary event for men and women who took one or more drinks a day rarely and for men who took more than 13 drinks a day on one or two days a week or every day . " Having a couple of drinks had a strong protective effect against heart attack in women for 24 hours , but not so strong an effect in men . This could be because alcohol affects the fibrinolytic system , part of the process involved in blood clotting , they said . The effects only last 24 hours . McElduff said they also had taken account of the possibility that non - drinkers in some of the studies did not drink because they had health problems . Nonetheless , they said drinking alcohol should not be promoted as a health measure because of the bad effects of too much drinking .

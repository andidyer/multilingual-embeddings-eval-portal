Only whiz kids need apply in money markets . Jobs will abound in capital markets in 1997 but employers are getting choosy , looking for market - savvy newcomers who aren ' t afraid of derivatives , recruitment specialists said . The boom in the specialist derivatives sector over the past 12 months is set to continue into 1997 , with the demand for highly skilled people outstripping supply . " Who isn ' t hiring ? It is a very positive market , " said Nigel Haworth , executive director at Sheffield Haworth in London . " Everyone would seem to be on a high for what next year might bring . There is going to be more emphasis on the sexier product rather than the plain vanilla . " Andrew Jenkins , senior partner at Trafalgar Consulting in London , agreed the growth was in derivatives and related areas . " People are increasing their strength in the market , " he said . " The vast majority of our mandates within the fixed income sector are in asset swaps , credit derivatives and LIBOR - based products , and repos are becoming important . " GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETSBut it was a different story for government bond markets , particularly as planned European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) approached in 1999 , Jenkins said . The number of bond products traded after EMU is likely to shrink initially as " euro " bonds replace various sovereign debt issued in separate currencies , analysts said . " There are a number of people who are reviewing their positions in those markets , " Jenkins said . " The vast majority of houses will not need 60 percent of their staff ( after EMU ) . " Some firms have reduced their capital market staff in recent weeks . Sumitomo Finance International cut 10 fixed income staff in London , Credit Suisse cut around 30 jobs from its foreign exchange and treasury operations and First Chicago NBD Corp is set to close its U . S . Treasuries operation early next year . Richard Wall , managing partner at Heidrick & Struggles in London , said there were always some redundancies at this time of the year as institutions reviewed their position in the market . " A huge amount of attrition in the last few weeks has been letting some people go in areas that have become dormant . It ' s a clear message as to where one ' s career is , " he said . EXPERIENCE NECESSARYRecruitment agencies said hands - on market experience was as important as specialist skills . " It ' s not only exposure to the derivative markets but a real understanding of the markets and the strong client base that can use these products . That is where the profits are for my clients , " said Jenkins . Haworth said institutions were not looking to employ people and train them up . " It ' s a case of wanting people to come in and deliver from day one . They have to be skilled and highly technically orientated . They have to be able to deliver and add value as soon as possible , " he said . SALARIES INCREASEDSalaries too have increased , especially over the past few months , although the main change to have taken place is in the terms of employment . " Certainly in the second half of 1996 salaries have risen considerably , due to the supply and demand situation , " said Haworth . " In the main , base salaries tend to be capped but the impact has been on the levels of guarantees put in place for 1997 and 1998 , with people being offered two - or three - year contracts , rather than a one - year contract . " Jenkins said firms were shopping around and taking their time in selecting new staff . " People are still licking their wounds from the bad years within the market . " Haworth said 1996 had seen major growth in European banks . " There has been a tremendous appetite , particularly for trading , distribution and structuring people . " A manager at another London recruitment agency said , derivatives were inevitably a growing field as European banks sought to take measures to avoid being hurt by British regulations on foreign investors in equities .

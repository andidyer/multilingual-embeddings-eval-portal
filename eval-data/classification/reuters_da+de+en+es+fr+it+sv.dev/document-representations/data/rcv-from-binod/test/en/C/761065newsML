Arbed , Cockerill shares gain on bullish EU report . Shares in steel firms Arbed and Cockerill gained on solid demand on Monday in the wake of a bullish European Commission report on the outlook for the European Union ' s steel industry this year . Arbed gained 170 francs at 4 , 540 at 1215 GMT , off a 4 , 600 franc high . Cockerill was up 10 francs at 161 after peaking at 162 . " The report , pointing to better steel prices , set off interest in the sector , " one trader said . Cyclicals were generally in demand on Monday ' s bourse as attention turned to the possibility of higher exports boosting the wider economy on the back of a strong dollar , dealers said . The European Commission said in its report , published on Friday , that increasing output should help boost profitability . The steel industry would benefit from stronger economic growth in the 15 - nation bloc , increasing demand for steel , especially in the second half of the year . " The business upswing for the main steel - consuming industries , which need to build up stocks of finished products to meet increased domestic demand and export commitments , points to faster growth in Community steel production over the coming months , " the report said . Earlier this month Generale Bank upgraded Arbed shares to ' buy ' , saying the share had lagged competitors since the start of the year . In terms of earnings it said it regarded 1997 as a transitional year with a very weak first half . At the time Arbed shares traded at 4 , 290 francs . Arbed chief executive officer Joseph Kinsch told the annual meeting in late June that the positive effects of a recovery in prices and demand would be felt in results in coming quarters . Arbed posted a 1 . 21 billion franc loss in 1996 . Cockerill , booking a nine billion franc loss in 1996 , partly because of exceptional costs , is working on a restructuring plan to curb costs and boost competitiveness . Analysts have said Cockerill would benefit from price rises for steel and hot dipped galvanised products . But in its latest quarterly private banking report , Bank MeesPierson NV left its rating for Cockerill unchanged at ' hold ' . It saw earnings per share falling in 1997 before recovering in 1998 . - - Nieck Ammerlaan , Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6816 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

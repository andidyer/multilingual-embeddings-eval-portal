Bolivia sees no hurry to bring back tin quotas . Bolivia might support a move by the Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) to bring back export quotas , but it does not regard such a measure as urgent , Mining Secretary Teddy Cuentas said . " Bolivia is interested in maintaining market stability , for which reason it does not rule out a possible re - establishment of controls on supply . But it also considers that the market has behaved in a satisfactory way recently and there is no need to meddle with it , " Cuentas told Reuters . But he added : " Bolivia hopes that the ATPC will guarantee there will be no oversupply and that on the other hand it stimulates demand to boost prices still further . " Cuentas will head the Bolivian delegation to the ATPC ' s ministerial meeting in Singapore September 23 - 24 . His comments follow declarations by a Brazilian government official Tuesday , who said that Brazil has no plans to join the ATPC and upgrade its observer status because of the orgnization ' s lack of clout . " Brazil will remain as an observer . Our entrance now would be useless , " Giovanni Toniatti , secretary of Mines and Metallurgy at the Mines and Energy Ministry said . Last year , at a meeting in Bolivia , Brazilian representatives said the country would join the ATPC . But Toniatti said Thailand ' s recent pullout from the ATPC has weakened the association , which seeks to control the world ' s supply of tin . - - Carlos Quiroga , La Paz Newsroom + 5912 39 - 1366

Mauritius rupee weakens on dollar and pound . The Mauritian rupee weakened versus both the dollar and pound on Friday , forex dealers said . The rupee was fixed at a mean commercial rate of 20 . 6840 against the dollar from 20 . 6475 on Thursday . The rupee weakened to a mean of 32 . 8165 for one pound from 32 . 7075 on Thursday . Dealers said the weaker rupee reflected the stronger dollar in international markets and a hard currency shortage in banks despite market intervention on Thursday . " Although the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate sold pounds and the central bank sold dollars yesterday ( Thursday ) , there is still a shortage in banks , " one dealer said . The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate is allowed to sell 25 percent of the country ' s sugar export earnings directly to banks . The remaining 75 percent is kept by the central bank for market intervention . Sugar is the largest hard currency earner for Mauritius in terms of net value added . Hard currency reserves in banks are expected to run short fairly quickly due to higher demand from importers at this time of year because of the forthcoming end of year festivities , dealers said .

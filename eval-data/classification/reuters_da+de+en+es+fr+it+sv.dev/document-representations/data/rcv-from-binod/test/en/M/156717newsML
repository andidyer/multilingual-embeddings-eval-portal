Ringgit up from 6 - mth low but seen falling . The ringgit hit a six - month low against the U . S . dollar before recovering on profit - taking , but analysts and dealers said on Thursday it was just taking a breather and commercial demand would drive it lower . They said speculators were buying dollars in anticipation of heavy corporate demand from Kuala Lumpur ahead of the year end and on the strength of the dollar against the Japanese yen . After a steady overnight decline in London and New York , the ringgit hit a low of 2 . 5325 a dollar in early Asian trading before recovering to 2 . 5245 / 55 by 0800 GMT . It closed at 2 . 5250 / 60 in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday and 2 . 5025 last Friday . Foreign exchange dealers in Singapore said heavy dollar offers from Kuala Lumpur banks , rumoured to be under advice from Malaysia ' s central bank Bank Negara , stopped the decline . No confirmation was available either from Bank Negara or the Malaysian banks . " This breather should last just today and tomorrow . Next week there should be more upside to dollar / ringgit , " said a dealer with a Malaysian bank in Kuala Lumpur . " I think the market is looking for another chance to push up the ringgit to 2 . 5330 ( this week or next week ) , " said Andy Tan , economist with MMS International in Singapore . He said if the dollar continued to climb against the yen , the ringgit could head lower toward 2 . 5350 and then to 2 . 54 . But some dealers said 2 . 5325 a dollar was the high for the time being and a further decline would have to be supported by strong commercial demand . A dealer with a large European bank in Singapore said the primary reason for the sharp drop was the unwinding of ringgit positions against the Singapore dollar by U . S . funds . " The unwinding was ( worth ) nearly $ 500 million . That broke a lot of ( stop loss levels ) , " the dealer said . He said the U . S . funds were unwinding their structured portfolio positions after Malaysia announced a friendly , but unexciting , 1997 annual budget last Friday . " The market has been looking for some excuse to buy dollar / ringgit for the past one week since the budget was announced . They got that yesterday and today , " Tan of MMS said . The ringgit ' s fall was initially triggered by a comment by an assistant governor of Bank Negara in Hong Kong on Monday that the central bank may consider imposing capital controls if short - term capital became dominant in fund flows . She clarified that this was a possibility only under extreme circumstances that did not exist at present . On Wednesday , rumours that the U . S . was seeking sanctions against Malaysia ' s national oil company , Petronas , and that Bank Negara was comfortable with the ringgit at 2 . 53 level , triggered ringgit sales . Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ' s comment that the ringgit ' s fall was unrelated to Petronas and that it was due to a strong dollar ahead of the U . S . presidential elections had little impact on the market , dealers said . The ringgit also was expected to decline for technical reasons . Dealers said year - end dollar demand by Malaysian firms , the repatriation of profits by foreign investors and the government forecast in the Economic Report for 1996 / 97 of large monthly trade deficits of one billion ringgit ( $ 400 million ) for the rest of the year , were expected to pull down the ringgit . - - Kuala Lumpur newsroom ( 603 - 230 8911 )

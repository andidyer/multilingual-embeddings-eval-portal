UK gilts power ahead but end just off new record . UK gilts inched back from a new all - time high set at 11 - 10 earlier on Friday , but still ended the session more than a full point higher on the day . Analysts said the positive sentiment rooted in gilts ' significant outperformance of Bunds this week was given an extra lift by a relatively benign U . S . January jobs report . " We went into the payroll figures this afternoon with gilts already generally quite popular , " said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC in London . " And the bonus was that the payrolls were really quite friendly . " Traders said a number of market players , who had been loitering on the sidelines , were encouraged to move into the gilt market after the U . S . report . The payroll showed 271 , 000 jobs were added in January - - compared with forecasts for 237 , 000 - - but analysts said debt markets were focusing more on figures showing that fewer hours were worked and earnings showed only a modest rise . March gilt futures ended 1 - 2 / 32 up at 113 - 07 , while March short sterling closed 0 . 04 up at 93 . 72 . " We saw very firm market after the U . S . figures , " said a gilts salesman in London . " But it was also very well - supported before the numbers and now we have far more buyers looking to get in . " In the cash market , the 10 - year yield spread of gilts to Bunds snapped tighter , narrowing by a further nine basis points this session and taking the total outperformance for the week to almost 20 basis points . The spread ended at 163 basis points - - the lowest closing level since mid - October last year . " Gilts have done very well aganist Germany this week and we ' ve seen a lot of switching into both sterling and gilts from overseas markets - - particularly Italy , " the salesman said . And gilts are set to steal the show for a few sessions yet . " There is a good chance this spread tightening will continue , " said Coleman . " But once we get to a spread of around 160 to Bunds , then you have to start asking where the value is . " Inflation will be the watchword for next week , with January producer price data kicking off on Monday and the Bank of England ' s inflation report and retail prices following on Wednesday and Thursday . Ciaran Barr , economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , said he expected to see declines in both prodcuer and RPIX inflation , aided by the recent strength in sterling . But he said the inflation report on Wednesday was likely to call for a 50 basis point rise in base rates from their currenct 6 . 00 percent level . - - Kate Kelland , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7708

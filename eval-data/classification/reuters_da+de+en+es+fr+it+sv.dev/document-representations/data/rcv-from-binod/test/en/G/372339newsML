Britain calls Burma " nasty , dictatorial regime " . British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Wednesday the Burmese military government was a " rather nasty , dictatorial regime " , but stopped short of calling for its international isolation . Rifkind was in Singapore for a meeting between ministers from the seven - nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) and the European Union ( EU ) , where moves to deepen ties were stalled over how to deal with Burma and East Timor and the issue of human rights . Amnesty International said in a report released on Wednesday that political repression and human rights violations in Burma last year reached their highest levels since the late 1980s . Burma ' s military government later slammed the report as " ridiculous " and said it was propaganda for anti - Burmese organisations . Amnesty also urged ASEAN ministers attending this week ' s meeting to redouble pressure on the Burmese authorities to improve their human rights record . ASEAN , which says constructive engagement will bring about reforms in Burma , has agreed to admit Burma as a member along with Laos and Cambodia some time in the future . ASEAN groups Indonesia , Malaysia , Brunei , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . Asked if Britain supported Amnesty ' s call for an end to ASEAN ' s policy , Rifkind said : " It is a matter for ASEAN to decide what relationship it wishes to have with Burma . " " Burma is not the only example in the world of a rather nasty , dictatorial regime . There are sadly other countries of a similar characteristic , " Rifkind told academics later . Rifkind also praised Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her efforts to bring democracy to the country . Some major Western multinationals such as PepsiCo have already stopped doing business in Burma under pressure from their shareholders . Western diplomats said the Amnesty report was expected to add another stumbling block to efforts by Southeast Asia and the European Union to cement ties at two days of ministerial meetings starting in Singapore on Thursday . Senior officials from the EU and ASEAN could not agree on wording for a final declaration that indirectly deals with the issues of Burma and East Timor , delegates said . They said the major topic at the preparatory meeting for the two days of ministerial discussions was Burma , but the fight between Portugal and Indonesia over East Timor was the big stumbling block . " The Portuguese will not agree any declaration that could bind them to extending relations with Indonesia or ASEAN while perceived human rights problems in East Timor remain unresolved , " said an EU official who declined to be identified . Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 after a civil war following Lisbon ' s abrupt decolonisation . Indonesia has threatened to walk out if East Timor was brought up at this week ' s meetings . In Burma , the country ' s military rulers and the opposition led by Aung San Suu Kyi held separate events to mark the golden jubilee of Union Day , signalling that political divisions still run deep in the multi - ethnic nation . Union Day marks a key agreement on the country ' s road to independence from Britain , which was finally reached in 1948 . About 10 , 000 people joined SLORC leaders at a government celebration in the People ' s Square in central Rangoon , while about 1 , 000 NLD supporters and some diplomats crowded into the grounds of Suu Kyi ' s lakeside residence to mark the day . Suu Kyi ' s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party called for tripartite talks between the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , various ethnic groups and pro - democracy forces to build national reconciliation . Prime Minister General Than Shwe , in an apparent reference to the Suu Kyi - led opposition and its western democracy supporters , urged ethnic groups to rise up and crush internal and external elements out to disturb Burma ' s progress . He said 15 armed rebel groups had returned to the legal fold but made no mention of the Karen National Union guerrilla group , which has been fighting the Rangoon government for greater autonomy since 1948 . About 500 Burmese troops launched an attack on Karen National Union ( KNU ) guerrillas inside eastern Burma on Wednesday , sending 2 , 000 refugees fleeing into Thailand , rebel and Thai army sources said .

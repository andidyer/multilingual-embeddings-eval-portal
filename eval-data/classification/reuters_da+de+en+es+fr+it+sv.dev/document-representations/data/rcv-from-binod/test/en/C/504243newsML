INTERVIEW - Politics curb energy reforms - expert . The pace of degregulation of the oil markets in many Asian countries has slowed in the face of social and political obstacles and rising crude prices , a leading American energy expert said on Friday . But the need to get prices down and get private capital in will ensure that some of these countries keep pushing for reforms , said Dennis Eklof , senior consultant with U . S . - based Cambridge Energy Research Associates . " I see more caution because some fundamental things are standing in the way , " Eklof told Reuters in an interview . Previously , Japan was willing to pay higher prices for its liquified natural gas ( LNG ) as an alternative to oil for security reasons , but now it was not , he said . Japan deregulated its energy markets last April and the first year of reforms resulted in a major shake - up leading to leaner operations and competitive prices . The increased competition forced 26 gasoline stations to close in 1996 , but analysts expect the current number of petrol stations , 60 , 000 , to be reduced to about 38 , 000 in 2005 . The retail price of gasoline has fallen by about 13 percent in Japan over the past two years . He said Asian countries were deregulating their energy sector either to lower manufacturing costs or to attract private sector capital to develop power and refining capacity . The unwillingness of people to pay high prices for their fuel needs simply to ensure supplies , as was the case in the 1970s , also increased pressure for reforms , he said . " People have a certain degree of comfort in maintaining supply from the Middle East . There is more emphasis now on cost competitiveness and less on security , " Eklof said . But protected economies such as India and China are not likely to enjoy similar benefits , said Eklof . Large government subsidies on kerosene and diesel , which have kept prices artifically low in India , make it very hard the sector there to deregulate . " The social and political backlash is too much . The removal of price subsidies is more difficult in a rising market , " Eklof said . He said unless international oil prices fell , it would be tough to push reform as retail prices would have to be raised in a liberalised market to keep up with the higher costs . Reforms are also being handled cautiously in countries such as Taiwan , China , Indonesia and Vietnam where state - owned companies have a monopoly in the retail oil market . Eklof said it such cases the government was giving the state monopolies more time to rationalise their operations before introducing deregulation measures . " It will cost CPC a substantial market share , " he said of Taiwan ' s China Petroleum Corp . Taiwan is due to open its refined oil product market to domestic competition in 1999 when Formosa Plastics opens a refinery . China Petrochemical Corp ( SINOPEC ) , the state giant which owns about 80 percent of all Chinese refining capacity , is also working hard to bring its costs down to stay competitive ahead of the ineviable reforms . To give SINOPEC more time , the Chinese government has kept foreign companies out of the domestic refining sector . Indonesia and Vietnam have yet to announce deregulation plans . - - Singapore Newsroom ( + 65 - 870 - 3093 )

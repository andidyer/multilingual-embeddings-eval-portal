( he ) asked the Palestinian Authority to find the murderers and to extradite them if they are in the area of the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority . " Jewish settler spokesman Aharon Domb demanded the army initiate " hot pursuit " , a search for wanted persons , in the self - rule enclave telling Israel Radio it was " the drill " for guerrillas to escape to self - rule areas . An Israeli was killed in a similar drive - by shooting near Beit El in May .

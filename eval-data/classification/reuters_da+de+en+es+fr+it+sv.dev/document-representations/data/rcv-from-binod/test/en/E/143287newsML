Russia could face problems over payment of an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) loan in November unless budget revenues show signs of improvement , Finance Minister Alexander Livshits was quoted as saying on Friday . A Fund mission monitoring Russia ' s economic performance left without reaching a conclusion on whether the latest tranche of the $ 10 billion three - year loan should be paid . Livshits said the IMF ' s key concern was over tax revenue . " Problems with the IMF tranches may arise in November if there is not a positive dynamic in budget revenues , " he was quoted as saying by Prime - Tass news agency . " The same thing worries the IMF as worries us - - federal budget revenues . They want from us the same as we want from ourselves - - a normal budget . " The IMF delayed a payment of some $ 300 million earlier this year but eventually handed over the money . Prime - Tass quoted Livshits as saying government changes to the draft 1997 budget were aimed at strengthening the part of it dealing with investment . Expenditure on production for export and on conversion of military industry was being increased .

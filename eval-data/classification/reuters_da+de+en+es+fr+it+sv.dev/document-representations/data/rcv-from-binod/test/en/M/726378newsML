Mortgage - backed securities post small losses . Mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) posted small losses Monday , keeping pace with intermediate Treasuries , as the swift interest rate decline paused and prepayment fears ebbed . The lull was related to summertime quiet ahead of a full roster of economic and inflation news . June retail sales , housing starts , industrial production and consumer price data were expected to set the tone this week . Current - coupon 7 1 / 2 - percent MBS 30 - year bonds were 4 / 32 to 7 / 32 lower , while 10 - year Treasury notes were down 7 / 32 . Arthur Frank , vice president of mortgage research at HSBC Markets , saw some selling by mortgage bankers this session . The sales were mainly conventional 30 - year 7 . 0 - percent coupons with October and September settlements , he said . " This is the normal pace of originators hedging rate locks that they have given borrowers , " Frank explained . Meanwhile , much of the down - in - coupon MBS trades that hedged against a possible pickup in prepayments subsided Monday , Frank said . Those trades would resume if Treasury yields continued to slide , several participants said . Among key issues , Government National Mortgage Association 7 1 / 2 - percent 30 - year bonds declined 6 / 32 to 101 - 09 / 32 bid to a bond equivalent yield of 7 . 34 percent . Comparable Federal National Mortgage Association securities fell 4 / 32 to 101 - 04 / 32 while Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp securities lost 5 / 32 to 101 - 08 / 32 . Ten - year Treasury notes were down 7 / 32 at 102 - 22 / 32 to yield 6 . 25 percent and the 30 - year Treasury bond eased by 10 / 32 to 100 - 30 / 32 for a 6 . 55 percent yield . Market players said they saw less effort to trim MBS purchases and increase holdings of Treasurys on Monday . " I would say you saw the first wave . It was a four - foot wave , not a 10 - foot wave " of Treasuries buying from typical MBS investors , a Treasury market strategist said . Swaps out of MBS into Treasuries " have not been a driving force in our market since Thursday , " but would accelerate if bond yields started to fall again , he predicted . With many senior investors away on vacation , Frank said , " CMOs are in the summer blahs . " This week ' s June data were expected to reveal a 0 . 2 - percent retail sales gain and a 0 . 5 - percent increase in retail sales excluding autos , according to economists surveyed by Reuters . Meanwhile , economists surveyed by Reuters said they expected a 0 . 2 - percent rise in both the core and non - core Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) . Also , economists polled predicted a moderate rise in housing starts to 1 . 45 million from 1 . 397 million units in May and a 0 . 2 - percent rise in industrial production . The first of those indicators , retail sales , was scheduled for Tuesday at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT . ( ( - - Lynn Adler , 212 - 859 - 1677 , Aleksandrs Rozens 212 - 859 - 1668 ) )

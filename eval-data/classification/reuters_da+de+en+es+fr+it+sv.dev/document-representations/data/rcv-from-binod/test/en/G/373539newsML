Belgian police in child sex probe find clothing . Investigators into Belgium ' s child rape and murder scandal have found items they believe belonged to eight children in searches of houses linked to chief suspect Marc Dutroux , Belgian media said on Wednesday . " The reports are true , " a Gendarmerie spokeswoman said . " We can only deplore that this information was leaked to the press . " " We are trying to generate a mood of confidence between the investigators and the parents and this leak , which did not come from the parents , does not help at all , " she added . The reports said the investigators had recovered nearly 4 , 500 items of clothings , toys and jewellery during their searches of houses either owned by or connected to Dutroux , a convicted child rapist , around the central city of Charleroi . They had also collected 20 , 000 hairs which were now being analysed . Dutroux , a father of three , was arrested in mid - August after an eye witness identyified a car belonging to him at the scene of a child kidnapping . Within days police had rescued two sexually abused young girls from a secret dungeon in one of his houses . They later unearthed the bodies of four others as well as that of a former accomplice , Frenchman Bernard Weinstein . Dutroux , who has admitted murdering Weinstein , has also been charged with the murder of two of the girls as well as kidnapping , paedophile sex , rape and illegal imprisonment . A source close to the investigation said the items of clothing had been tentatively identified as having been worn by the eight children on the days they disappeared using a technique developed by the accident victim identification squad . This involves cross - matching types , colours , sizes and , where possible , labels with the descriptions given by the parents . The source stressed that this did not guarantee that the identification was accurate , which was why the parents of the children had been asked to view the selected items themselves . If the identifications are confirmed it will be the first time a direct link has been established between Dutroux and other missing children . During the identification visits , the places and dates of which are being kept secret , the parents will be accompanied by psychological counsellors from the Red Cross . Another source said , contrary to one newspaper report , the parents of only two of the dead girls had been asked to identify clothing - - meaning that the six others on the list were children of whom no trace has previously been found . The source refused to give any names . The sources agreed with the Gendarmerie spokeswoman that the leaking of the news was unfortunate , but they noted that the leak had been one of a long line that has plagued the inquiries since they began . In January a covert police operation to obtain information from a jailed peadophile by placing an informer in his prison cell was blown by leaks to the press . There have also been others , including of private letters and files as a special parliamentary commission probes the previous investigations conducted by magistrates , police and gendarmes into the missing children . " It is very possible that some people , who either think or know they will be named , are trying to wreck the inquiry , " one source said . " But that doesn ' t mean they will succeed . "

Indonesians flee homes after riot in West Timor . Some 200 Indonesian migrants have taken refuge in police and military compounds on the western half of Timor island after an ethnic riot this week on the island , police said on Wednesday . Hundreds of local people from West Timor rioted in Kefamenanu in East Nusa Tenggara province on Monday , setting fire to dozens of homes of migrants from South Sulawesi and the main island of Java as well as destroying a market . " We are still investigating the cause of the riot and six people have been detained because of that , " a policeman on duty in Kefamenanu told Reuters by telephone . " About 200 people have taken refuge at police and military headquarters after the riot . They are in poor condition . . . they fled their houses which were burned during the riot and did not take anything except their own clothes , " he said . Kefamenanu is located some 190 km ( 118 miles ) east of the provincial capital Kupang . The police said he had no further details , but added the hundreds of troops were deployed in the town and that many shops were still closed . " It ' s hard to find food here because many shops are closed , " he added . The Timor clash occurred only one day after the native Dayak tribe and the migrants from Madura off the main island of Java agreed on Sunday to put an end to recent ethnic clashes in West Kalimantan province in which 12 people were reported killed . More than 300 people are said to have died in violence fueled by deep seated racial tensions which erupted in the province , on the Indonesian side of Borneo island , between Dayaks and Maduran migrants in December . The official Antara news agency reported on Wednesday at least three security officers were injured when trying to contain the riot in Kefamenanu , but did not say what caused it . It said the migrants started to flee to the police and military headquarters on Tuesday . The agency gave no further details . Last month , one migrant from South Sulawesi was killed in ethnic rioting directed against migrants in the enclave of Ambeno in West Timor . Eighty - six houses of Moslem migrants were burnt in the incident apparently sparked after a Catholic priest was served a meal of food scraps at an official function . Since January 1995 , there have been a number of similiar incidents in neighbouring East Timor involving attacks by locals against migrant traders triggered by apparently minor incidents .

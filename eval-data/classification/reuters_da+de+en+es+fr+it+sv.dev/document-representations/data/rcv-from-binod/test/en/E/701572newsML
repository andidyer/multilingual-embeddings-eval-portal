Dangers seen in Yugoslav drive to boost output . Economic policy aimed at boosting Yugoslav production at any cost could cause disastrous damage to the country ' s development base , Belgrade analysts warned on Wednesday . " It is possible to achieve industrial growth on the principle of producing only 90 dinars for an investment of 100 . But in that way the capital will be irretrievably lost , " said Stojan Stamenkovic , leading economist of the Institute for Economic Sciences . According to official statistics , Yugoslav year - on - year industry growth in May was 9 . 3 percent . The figures for January - May were up 7 . 8 percent from the same 1996 period . " The paradox of the economy here is that while production rises firms incur losses , " Stamenkovic said . In 1996 , industrial output rose 7 . 5 percent against 1995 but the economy suffered a net loss of some 8 . 75 billion dinars ( $ 1 . 18 billion ) . Gross domestic product ( GDP ) was 68 . 15 billion dinars , 76 percent up on 1995 . But it fell almost nine percent in real terms . The target for 1997 is a 13 percent growth of GDP and 14 percent rise in industrial output . Serbia , which together with Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia , faces a shortage of cash made worse by a credit blockade and an economy in recession . It has tried to ease the shortage by selling a 49 percent stake in Telekom Srbija to Italian and Greek companies . The republic , which accounts for 95 percent of Yugoslavia ' s GDP , raised 1 . 568 billion German marks from the sale . Eighty percent of this amount is already in the coffers of the Serbian Development Fund . The balance is to be paid in January . The Fund said the money would be used to boost export industries , agriculture and large infrastructure projects . But economists said injections of cash into working capital would not be enough to bring about permanent development because of burgeoning company losses , outdated technology and growing social tensions . The economy is also burdened with a $ 7 billion inter - company debt accumulated since 1994 when the economy started from scratch after hyperinflation of 60 percent a day . " It would be a mistake to renew present structures . Structural changes and new market - oriented production should be financed , " said Danilo Sukovic , head of the economic research department of Institute for Social Sciences . Stamenkovic said it would be a mistake to repeat what happened in 1996 , when seasonally adjusted industrial output rose 14 percent from June to end - November . If financial injections fuelled a similar rise in the second half of this year , industrial output could surge beyond current gloomy forecasts to exceed the 1996 level by some six percent , he said . Economists fear that funds could be allocated for reasons other than market ones . " Entrusting the distribution to the state fund carries the risk of most of the money being spent on preserving social peace ahead of presidental and parliamentary elections later this year , " said director of the Institute for Foreign Trade Radovan Kovacevic . One analyst , who asked not to be named , said the ruling Socialists were obviously prepared to sell other public companies as well as Telekom . Economists say the country needs some $ 2 billion annually for the next five years to keep its economy going . - - Belgrade Newsroom + 381 11 311 4254 ( $ = 4 . 85 Yugoslav Dinars )

Mexico ' s two richest men cut down on cigarettes . Mexico ' s two richest men , who both built their empires in part from tobacco , recently sold off big stakes in their cash - cow cigarette businesses to global tobacco firms within weeks of each other . Do Carlos Slim and Alfonso Romo , together worth $ 8 . 6 billion according to Forbes magazine , know something that the buyers , tobacco giants Philip Morris and B . A . T . Industries Plc , do not ? Not necessarily , say analysts . Slim and Romo simply want to make money faster than the slow - growing cigarette business will let them and to hedge against the troublesome tobacco industry . " They both got a good deal . . . and can put the money to good use in other areas , " concluded Alexander Ryshawy , an analyst at Paribas in New York . In early July , Slim ' s Cigatam SA , part of his conglomerate Grupo Carso , got $ 400 million in exchange for allowing Philip Morris to raise its stake in the firm from 29 percent to 50 percent . Three weeks later , Philip Morris ' rival British American Tobacco , or B . A . T , said it would dole out $ 1 . 7 billion to buy Romo ' s Cigarera La Moderna ( CLM ) , part of his conglomerate Empresas La Moderna . Philip Morris and B . A . T were keen to get back into Mexico , where they once competed before being sidelined by government restrictions on foreign investment in the 1970s . They now want to cash in on a growing market that is largely unaffected by the industry ' s legal woes in the United States and Europe . Both companies may also use Mexico as a platform for exports to other Latin American nations , analysts say . Slim and Romo struck a similar deal . Carso sold its share for about 13 - 14 times yearly cash flow but kept a voice in the joint venture ' s management , while Moderna sold for about 15 - 16 times but relinquished control of the business . The most obvious difference between the deals is that Romo appears sure to exit the cigarette business altogether while Slim has only reduced his exposure . But both deals made good business sense . In the case of Romo , an agronomist by training , the tobacco business allowed him to diversify La Moderna and build an agrobiotechnology empire that he believes will pay handsome future dividends . " Clearly , La Moderna ' s exit from the cigarette business is due to Romo ' s leadership . He sees an opportunity in agrobiotech and wants to focus his efforts there , " said Francisco Chavez of Smith Barney in New York . Already the world ' s largest producer of vegetable seeds , the B . A . T . deal gives La Moderna a war chest for new agrobiotechnology purchases , analysts say . Not to be outdone , Slim also made the type of deal that has earned him fame as Latin America ' s shrewdest businessman . He locked in a partnership with Philip Morris and the right to distribute its market - leading Marlboro brand to 2020 . Cigatam ' s rights to Marlboro had been due to expire in two years , and some analysts had wondered aloud whether Philip Morris might dump Carso and go it alone in Mexico . Carso will use the money in part to pay down debt from recent acquisitions , including Sears , Roebuck & Co . ' s Mexico division , but it will keep a stake in the cigarette business to help fund new ventures . " Carso is always getting into something new . They buy it cheap and turn it around and everyone else wonders why they didn ' t do it first , " Chavez said .

Thames , water stocks hit by Ofwat attack . Shares in Thames Water Plc and other UK water stocks dropped in pre - market trading on Wednesday after a press report that the industry regulator had attacked recent large dividend increases in the sector . In an interview with the Financial Times , Ofwat chief Ian Byatt said recent double - digit dividend increases from the likes of Anglian Water Plc and Yorkshire Water Plc were unsustainable and politically dangerous . The paper quoted Byatt as saying he was " very puzzled " over why such dividend increases were felt necessary and warned that big dividend increases encouraged a view that the government ' s planned " windfall " tax on utilities was a good idea . By 0725 GMT , Thames was down 7p at 683 , United Utilities Plc was down 2 - 1 / 2p at 692 - 1 / 2 , Anglian Water dropped 5 - 1 / 2p to 669 - 1 / 2 , Severn Trent Plc fell 5p to 779 - 1 / 2 , Yorkshire Water Plc was down 2p at 381 - 1 / 2 , Hyder Plc was down 4 - 1 / 2p at 804 , Wessex Water Plc eased 3p to 681 and South West Water Plc fell 6 - 1 / 2p to 722 - 1 / 2 . Dealers said Byatt ' s comments had not raised undue concerns about the water companies ' dividend outlook and noted he was not talking about action against high dividend increases . " It is just a small scare , there was just an early mark - down in the shares , " said one market maker . No one at Ofwat was immediately available for comment on the interview . - - David Holmes , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4367

FORECAST - PLDT net seen hit by low rates . The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co ( PLDT ) will see its 1997 profits rise only to about 6 . 5 billion pesos from a forecast 5 . 2 billion pesos in 1996 due to a proposed cut in international telephone rates , according to a Reuters poll . Conducted this week , the poll of five Manila brokerages showed most analysts have revised their projections of PLDT ' s 1997 earnings as a result of the accounting rate reduction planned by the U . S . Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) . The forecasts for 1996 net profits were an average 5 . 22 billion pesos , a 5 . 17 percent increase from last year ' s income of 4 . 97 billion pesos . In 1997 , the company is expected to generate an average of 6 . 52 billion pesos in profits , according to the respondents . The forecast would have been significantly higher had it not been for the proposed lowering of accounting rates , analysts said . Accounting rates refer to the cost of international phone calls . Of the current $ 1 . 00 per minute accounting rate , 50 percent goes to PLDT in what is called a settlement fee and the remaining half to its foreign counterpart . Early in December , the FCC announced its proposed across - the - board rate reduction . For upper - middle and middle income countries , under which the Philippines is classified , it proposed that settlement fees of 50 cents be reduced to 19 cents a minute within two years . Abacus Securities Corp research manager Erwin Tan said that although local telecommunications players anticipated the accounting rate reduction , the fall was steeper than expected . He said if the reduction to 19 cents were finally approved , it would mean a 38 percent average reduction per year in PLDT ' s revenue from international calls . Tan said he had sliced 1 . 80 billion pesos off his 1997 earnings forecast for the company . Other analysts agreed . " We had to shave off 1 . 6 billion pesos from our original 1997 net forecast with the pronouncement of the FCC , " said Alexis Cabel , analyst at Angping & Associates Securities Inc . To compensate for potentially lower profits , there should be a 22 percent hike in international call volumes , a 35 percent hike in domestic toll revenue due to increases in either volume or prices , and a two percent rise in local revenue rates , Tan said . Peregrine Securities analyst Ricardo Puig said the dent in PLDT ' s bottom - line may be offset by a tariff rebalancing scheme proposed by domestic telecommunications firms . This includes an increase in fees for local calls as well as national long - distance calls , and an increase in the volume of international calls , he said . " I expect additional upside from the proposed 100 peso monthly increase in fees by local carriers including PLDT , as well as from access charges imposed by PLDT on new operators , " said Raul Ruiz , vice - president for research at Sun Hung Kai Securities . ING Barings Securities investment analyst Louie Hilado said the reduction in PLDT ' s 1997 profits would be cushioned by a proposed metering scheme through which subscribers would be charged according to the duration of local calls . National Telecommunications Commission ( NTC ) head Simeon Kintanar said a metering scheme would be implemented in 1997 to replace the flat monthly fees that subscribers are charged . However , the analysts said projections of PLDT ' s 1997 earnings were tentative until the FCC ' s final approval of the rate reduction . The NTC , FCC ' s counterpart , would then have to approve the adjustment in rates .

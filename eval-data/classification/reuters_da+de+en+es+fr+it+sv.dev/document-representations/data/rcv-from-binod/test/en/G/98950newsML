SOCCER - UNBEATEN PSG UNDECIDED ABOUT NEW RECRUIT . A fine 2 - 0 victory over Le Havre , which gave Paris St Germain a six - point lead at the top of the French soccer league on Saturday , left the Parisians wondering whether they actually need an extra player . Rumours of an ace coming to the French capital have been circulating since almost the start of the season but Brazilian coach Ricardo saw no reason to change or reinforce his winning team . " There ' s no rush to look for an extra player . We have plenty of time to think and ponder , " said Ricardo . With a near - perfect record of 11 matches without defeat and only three goals conceded , PSG have few reasons to be worried . And their win against le Havre was earned without six key players , who were injured or called up by their national sides . Young second choice players such as goalkeeper Vincent Fernandez , who replaced international Bernard Lama , or Jerome Leroy , who stepped in for Brazil ' s Rai , showed they were fine replacements . There were bad news though for Ricardo on Monday as libero Alain Roche was complaining about a painful ankle . If the injury turns out to be serious , it would leave PSG without three of their six French internationals . It may also prompt club officials into looking for a new recruit faster than they expectedPSG sent talent scouts to the Netherlands last week , apparently to monitor PSV Eindhoven ' s Philip Cocu . Most of the gossip around PSG has been about strikers but injuries may decide otherwise . After a hectic week , in which they have played three matches and lost none , PSG can now enjoy a rest as France meet Turkey for a World Cup preparation match on Wednesday . The French league leaders then face two tricky clashes at Metz on Saturday and against champions Auxerre one week later .

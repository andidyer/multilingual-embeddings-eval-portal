Tough going at Bangladesh Hill Tracts peace talks . A third day of talks aimed at ending a decades - old separatist insurgency in Bangladesh ' s Chittagong Hill Tracts ended on Tuesday apparently without reaching any conclusions . A security official told reporters outside the conference hall that the talks would resume on Wednesday . Officials could not say if any progress had been made . More than 8 , 500 civilians , rebels and soldiers have been killed in a bush war started by tribal Shanti Bahini guerrillas in 1973 . Attempts to strike a peace deal since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took office last June have yet to bear any fruit , officials said . The Shanti Bahini want the 5 , 500 square miles ( 14 , 200 square km ) of hill tracts in the southeast of the country to be officially designated as a tribal homeland with full autonomy , and some 500 , 000 Bengali - speaking settlers to be expelled from the region , which borders India and Burma . The negotiations in Dhaka began hours behind schedule , with no official reason given for the delay . A police officer told reporters around 8 : 30 p . m . ( 2030 local ) that the negotiators had left the conference hall " through the back doors . " " Apparently they had nothing to report , " a security official said . The government side at the talks is being headed by Abdul Hasant Abdullah , parliamentary chief whip of the ruling Awami League . Heading the rebel side is Jyotirindra Budhipriya Larma , chief of the Shanti Bahini ' s political wing , Parbatya Chattagram Janasanghati Samity ( PCJSS ) . The current meeting is the third with government leaders since January , but meeting sources said a breakthrough was still awaited . The government has already started reclaiming tribal land and restoring it to thousands of tribal refugees who returned home in the first phase of a repatriation programme in March and April . But the government has refused to expel the Bengalis , fearing a severe backlash , Hill Tracts officials said . " The negotiations have hit rough ground on the issue of land rights of the tribes and their demand for a constitutional guarantee for special status of the tribal population , " one meeting source said . The settlers launched a strike in Hill Tracts on Sunday as the talks began in Dhaka against what they said was the government ' s willingness to give undue concessions to the tribals . The government , however , said it would do nothing that encroached upon the rights of the settlers .

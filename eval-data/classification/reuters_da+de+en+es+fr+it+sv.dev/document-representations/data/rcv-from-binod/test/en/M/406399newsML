NY precious metals end sharply higher , led by PGMs . COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended sharply higher Thursday , led again by the platinum group of metals , but the complex closed off the session ' s highs . " The surge in prices in the PGM markets can be explained by two factors , " CPM Group analyst Ted Kempf said . " The first is the increasing realization that Russian exports of platinum and palladium to Japanese manufacturers have been interrupted and this is forcing platinum and palladium users to go to the market for the metal they need and is lending upside support to prices . " " The second explanation is that the first delivery day for the March palladium contract is on March 3 and those individuals who had sold the March contract short are hustling to offset their positions prior to that date , " he said . " As of February 24 open interest in the March NYMEX palladium contract stood at 309 , 200 ounces , with only about 90 , 000 ounces of available stocks in NYMEX approved warehouses . " NYMEX April platinum ended up $ 10 . 30 an ounce at $ 397 . 00 Thursday , after seeing a four - month high at $ 399 . 80 intraday . Estimated total platinum futures volume was 9 , 902 lots . The April NYMEX platinum / COMEX gold spread soared further to $ 35 . 60 an ounce from $ 30 . 70 Wednesday and only $ 2 . 40 at the start of the year . In the physical market platinum fixed at $ 393 . 50 in London Thursday , the highest level since Semptember 9 , 1996 , after gaining about 10 percent in the past month . NYMEX June palladium closed up $ 7 . 20 an ounce at $ 157 . 50 , after seeing a new contract high at $ 159 . 25 early . In the physical market , palladium fixed at $ 157 . 00 an ounce , the highest since July 11 , 1995 , after gaining about 30 percent in the past month . The palladium sponge / plate differential widened to $ 5 . 00 - 8 . 00 an ounce . Workers at Russia ' s Norilsk mine have threatened to strike from March 15 over pay arrears . Earlier , in December 1996 , the annual Russian / Japanese supply contract talks broke down , and no supplies of Russian palladium are seen likely in March . But hedge funds have been capitalizing on the Russian supply difficulties , analysts said . Meanwhile , COMEX April gold ended up $ 5 . 00 an ounce at $ 361 . 40 , at a 36 day high , but closed off the session highs at $ 364 . 50 , after running into heavy selling from bullion banks and producers , traders said . Estimated total gold futures volume Thursday was a high 80 , 000 contracts . Earlier a breach of resistance at the January 28 high at $ 360 set off stop orders , and prompted more fund shortcovering , traders said . COMEX gold open interest fell a further 2 , 147 lots Wednesday to 182 , 312 and has fallen from 199 , 718 lots on February 13 as funds reduced their near - record net short positions , analysts said . " Fund short covering and some nervousness about the stock and bond markets , after Greenspan ' s comments yesterday , as well as spread relationships with the white metals were the factors driving gold higher today , " Kempf said . US Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan on Thursday warned again warned about excessive stock market valuations and suggested interest rates may need to be raised pre - emptively to counter potential inflation . Spot gold bullion ended quoted $ 358 . 90 / 40 , compared to the London Thursday afternoon fix at $ 360 . 00 , the highest fix since January 3 , 1997 . In New York Wednesday bullion closed quoted $ 354 . 00 / 50 . COMEX May silver ended up 4 . 7 cents at $ 5 . 290 , after seeing a six month intraday high at $ 5 . 395 . Estimated total silver futures volume was 33 , 000 lots . COMEX silver open interest rose 1 , 309 lots Wednesday to 94 , 905 . The spot gold / silver ratio continued to move back into gold ' s favor , ending at 68 . 4 , up from 68 . 07 Wednesday and a 22 month low at 66 . 15 on February 17 when gold prices saw three year lows around $ 336 . 40 . - - Clive McKeef , New York Commodities Desk , + 1 - 212 - 859 - 1641

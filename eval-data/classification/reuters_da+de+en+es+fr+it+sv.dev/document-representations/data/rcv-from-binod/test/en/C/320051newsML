Maybank seen posting strong earnings . Malayan Banking Bhd ( Maybank ) , Malaysia ' s biggest bank , is expected to announce strong half - year earnings despite slower loans growth , analysts said on Monday . Maybank is expected to post net profit of 580 - 600 million ringgit ( $ 234 - $ 242 million ) for the half - year ended December 31 , 1996 , up 23 . 5 to 27 . 7 percent from the same 1995 period . The results are expected to be released later this month . Maybank reported net earnings of 469 . 7 million ringgit at the half - year mark last year , and 1 . 07 billion ringgit for the year ended June 30 , 1996 . Analysts polled by the Estimate Directory have forecast net profit at an average 1 . 26 billion ringgit for the current financial year ending June 30 , 1997 , giving the stock a 1 . 10 ringgit net earnings per share . " Earnings should be in line with expectations if not better . We don ' t expect any surprises , " said Soon Teck Onn , banking analyst at ING - Barings . Mohaiyani Securities analyst Amin Abdul Manap said Maybank ' s results would continue to reflect the buoyant performance of the banking sector on the back of the country ' s robust economy , after nine years of eight percent growth or better . " We are estimating a half - year net profit of 582 million ringgit . But results were normally stronger in the second half , " Amin said . Analysts said the strong earnings would be achieved despite an expected slower loans growth of 10 - 15 percent this year . Maybank ' s full - year ends on June 30 , 1997 . Loans grew 15 percent in the previous financial year . " But it will still be a double - digit growth , " Amin said . Analysts said slight widening in interest margin was also seen helping profitability . Maybank reported a net interest margin of 3 . 2 percent in the first half of the previous financial year . Strong contributions are also expected from the group ' s finance arm , Mayban Finance , and Mayban Securities , its stockbroking unit . Kwong Yik Bank Bhd will also contribute to the first half - year results as the proposed sale of Maybank ' s 75 percent stake in Kwong Yik to stockbroking group Rashid Hussain Bhd for 2 . 16 billion ringgit has not been completed . Analysts said competition from merged banks was unlikely to affect Maybank ' s performance in the next few years . Local banks have been urged to become bigger and better capitalised through mergers to face foreign competition when Malaysia liberalises its financial services industry by 2005 . " Competition will be felt gradually , but that will be in the long term , " said an analyst with a foreign brokerage . Analysts said institutional investors would continue to favour Maybank stock . " Maybank is a core holding , a stock that every fund would want to include in its portfolio , " the foreign brokerage analyst said . Maybank stock was trading at 26 . 50 ringgit at midday on Monday against its close of 28 . 00 on December 31 , 1996 . ( $ 1 = 2 . 48 ringgit )

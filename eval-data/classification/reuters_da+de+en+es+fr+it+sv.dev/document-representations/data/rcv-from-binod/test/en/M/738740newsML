Budapest milling wheat up , maize down on weather . Rain in Hungary is likely to result in the lowest quality wheat crop for many years , with grains prices on the Budapest Commodity Exchange ( BCE ) reflecting the fact , dealers said . " Most of the news on wheat harvesting is bad , " said Istvan Grebats of Termin brokerage , adding that maize would benefit from the moderate temperatures . He added that the customary 60 - 40 milling wheat / feed wheat ratio in the harvest would be significantly different this year , with a lot of low - quality wheat expected . " I would say the ratio is likely to be 40 percent to 60 percent , " Grebats said . Accordingly , milling wheat prices rose the daily allowed 400 forints per tonne for most maturities . The two maturities for which the limit was removed on Thursday , January and March , jumped 820 forints to 25 , 370 and 900 forints to 26 , 200 respectively . Grebats said this year ' s wheat crop , while almost certain to reach the expected five million tonnes compared with last year ' s 3 . 9 million , was likely to be the lowest - quality crop in many years . He added that if the rise of milling wheat prices continued on Monday , other positions would also be freed up on Tuesday . Due to wheat quality expectations , feed wheat and feed barley prices dropped by the limit for all maturities , as did most maize maturities . Cold and rainy weather was almost ideal for maize and barring a drought during the next four weeks , the crop could even exceed last year ' s harvest of near six million tonnes , traders said . Grebats said the outlook for a good maize crop and plenty of low - quality wheat was depressing feed prices in general and export possibilities were limited . " The Czech and Polish market could take up some feed , but with the Polish market there is always the question of payments , " he said . This could depress feed wheat prices to around 17 , 000 forints per tonne , Grebats added . Total grains turnover plummeted to 481 lots or 221 . 4 million forints from Thursday ' s 1 , 090 lots or 498 million forints . ( Lot size = 20 , 000 kgs $ = 192 . 55 Hungarian forints ) - - Denes Albert , Budapest newsroom + 36 1 327 4040

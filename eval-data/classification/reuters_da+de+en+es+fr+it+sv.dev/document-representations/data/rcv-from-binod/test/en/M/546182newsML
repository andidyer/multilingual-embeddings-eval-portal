LIFFE coffee futures drift lower , May hit by sales . LIFFE coffee futures took little heed of New York ' s advance and the market headed lower by Tuesday ' s close with May being presssured by liquidation before Thursday ' s first tender day . Worries over the impending grading rule change starting with the July contract forced May holders to unwind their positions and moved further out . As a result , May / July switches were heavily traded , with the spread widening further to $ 65 by the close from $ 50 on Monday . " I think by the time May turns spot month on Thursday , the open interest will be quite small , " said a trader . May ' s open interest stood 2 , 588 lots lower at 7 , 881 lots by the close of Monday ' s business . By Tuesday ' s close , front - month May was $ 13 down at $ 1 , 532 a tonne while July broke below the $ 1 , 600 support level to finish $ 3 lower at $ 1 , 597 . Light origin sales were also seen at the highs . Overall volume was quite impressive at 11 , 759 lots , with May and July accounting for nearly 10 , 000 lots . An exchange spokesperson on Tuesday , responding to a query , said the grading rules had been endorsed by market participants , both members and users . Earlier some traders said there were worries over the grading and re - grading of coffee . " I think the concerns there are purely on the technical issue on grading the coffee and re - grading the coffee . If you take up May you are not sure you can re - tender it in July , " said a trader . " That ' s what has driven the switch to a big discount , bigger than it should really , " he said . " But I think it won ' t go much below this . If it comes much below this somebody will have the confidence to buy it , " the trader added . New York arabica motored higher in early brisk business partly due to the talk , and later confirmed , that U . S . roaster Folgers had raised its retail prices . Traders said a spate of bullish crop / stock news from Colombia late on Monday also provided the underlying support . - - Jalil Hamid , London newsroom + 44 171 542 4985

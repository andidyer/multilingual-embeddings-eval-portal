Greenpeace activists block Malta PM ' s office . Members of the Greenpeace group on Monday blocked the entrance to Maltese Prime Minister Alfred Sant ' s office in Valletta to protest against the increased use of environmentally harmful plastic bottles . Eyewitnesses said two members of the group scaled two seven - metre high columns on either side of the main entrance to the office and unfurled a banner reading " No time to waste " . Other members chained themselves across the entrance to the office , housed in an ornate 16th century palace . Greenpeace Mediterranean campaigner Paul Portelli said local industrialists are planning to use plastic bottles for soft drinks , which would add 130 million bottles a year to the growing amount of waste being dumped . He said the government was doing nothing to reduce the amount of waste being dumped by business and tourists . The campaigners were removed by police using rescue gear and clippers to cut the chains . There was no violence . It was not clear if charges would be pressed .

Venezuela to pay off $ 450 mln debts with oil money . The Venezuelan government plans to pay off at least 209 billion bolivars ( $ 450 million ) worth of foreign and domestic debt principal and interests from windfall oil revenues , a top government official said Tuesday . " The government has available 209 billion bolivars from excess oil revenues , " Armando Leon , vice planning minister , told reporters in Congress . Government officials have said they expect to receive over $ 2 . 5 billion in windfall oil revenues this year due to higher than expected oil prices . Most of that extra revenue has already been set aside through separate additional spending requests approved by Congress . Leon and other government officials present in Congress said there were no legal impediment to prevent Venezuela using the windfall oil money to buy back Brady bond debt . But they declined to say whether Venezuela would do so . - - Omar Lugo , Caracas newsroom , 582 505 2600

OPTIONS - Mark , yen vols go separate ways as dlr dips . Implied volatilities for dollar / mark options softened , while those for dollar / yen firmed as the spot greenback slid from recent highs in U . S . trading , dealers said . " The most interesting thing is that there ' s a divergence in dollar / mark and dollar / yen volatility reaction to spot ' s down move here , " said Alan Revercomb , options strategist at I . D . E . A . Inc . The dollar had slid to the mid - 122 yen area and the mid - 1 . 68 mark area by U . S . afternoon , after briefly rising against the mark to above 1 . 69 in early trade . Traders said part of the losses in dollar / mark volatilities were due to the mark - off of risk premium built in before today ' s Bundesbank policy council meeting , at which German interest rates were kept steady . But they noted there was a growing gap in the market ' s risk perception in the two dollar - pairs , with the dollar - bull camp more resilient in dollar / mark . " Dollar / mark is in the same scenario that we ' ve seen forever , where lower spot eases vols a little bit , " Revercomb said , adding that dollar / yen traders were becoming concerned about a dollar downturn . " The 125 ( yen ) ceiling seems completely solid , so there ' s fear that if something does occur , it ' s going to be to the downside , " he said . An interbank broker in New York agreed that the dollar / yen market was becoming spot - sensitive , particularly as the dollar crept down toward 122 yen . " As spot moves lower , people chase the offers and offers move away , " he said , adding that bids tended to fade when the dollar bounced back toward 123 yen in early trade . One - month dollar / yen implied volatility rose 0 . 2 point from late Wednesday levels to 11 . 0 / 11 . 3 percent . One - month dollar / mark implied volatility shed about 0 . 4 percent from late Wednesday levels to 10 . 3 / 10 . 5 percent . Lingering anticipation that the dollar would eventually test fresh highs above 1 . 7050 marks , given that the pullback has not been very steep yet , kept the dollar / mark volatility curve inverted . One - year stood at 9 . 5 / 9 . 7 percent . But dollar / yen was seen more contained , at least to the upside , and the volatility curve was stabilizing in a slightly positive slope . The interbank broker said there was good selling in one - week dollar / yen , probably as traders tried to unload excess gamma they had bought in recent weeks . A high gamma position , typically a result of buying short - dated options , is more sensitive to spot market gyrations but is also vulnerable to time decay . Risk reversals , which compare pricing of puts and calls , were narrowing their skew toward dollar calls . One - month 25 - delta risk reversals for dollar / yen and dollar / mark were both assessed at about at 0 . 2 / 0 . 4 percent in favor of yen puts and mark puts respectively . " We have seen slightly more sniffing around in downside options for the first time in a while , " Revercomb noted .

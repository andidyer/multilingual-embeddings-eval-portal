Zloty slips lower as foreigners bearish on Poland . Foreign investors held on to their zloty - depressing bearish stance on Polish treasuries on Thursday , brushing aside the Finance Minister ' s statement that a reduction in the zloty devaluation rate was being considered . " The central bank controls the exchange rate and ( Minister Marek ) Belka wants to drum up foreign interest in his papers . . . but in reality I don ' t expect a devaluation reduction in 1997 , " said Wojciech Kowalczyk , senior dealer at Bank Handlowy SA . The zloty hit another six - week low on Thursday , slipping to finish at 0 . 65 / 0 . 60 percent above the parity rate , down from Wednesday ' s 0 . 69 / 0 . 66 percent close . It closed at 3 . 3030 / 45 to the dollar , up from 3 . 3065 / 75 on Wednesday and at 1 . 8840 / 50 to the mark , down from 1 . 8774 / 80 in line with the U . S . dollar ' s decline against the mark . Earlier on Thursday Belka said that Poland was considering slowing the rate of the crawling peg devaluation , now at one percent per month against a basket of currencies , as consumer as well as producer price inflation was falling . " A monthly devalution of one percent is clearly pro - export and not anti - inflationary . So we are starting to think about the decelerating of the crawl . When ? I ' m not going to tell you , " Belka told Reuters Financial Television . Dealers said many foreigners were having trouble closing Polish positions because the secondary bond market was not liquid , which had caused yields to rise by over one point without creating much additional demand for the paper . " Fixed bond yields have soared with ( 15 - percent ) two - year paper now above 22 percent and ( 12 - percent ) five - year bonds yielding between 19 . 5 and 20 percent , " one dealer here said . Dealers said the zloty would remain at present levels of 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 percent above parity unless foreigners decided to uproot from Poland at all costs , sending the currency into a tailspin which may have to be stopped by interventions . On the money market one - day rates remained pinned to new central bank drainage levels as the market remained cash - full . Overnight rates closed at 22 . 10 / 22 . 45 percent from 22 . 40 / 22 . 50 percent at opening and tomorrow / next ended at 22 . 35 / 22 . 50 , just down from 22 . 40 / 22 . 55 . On Thursday the central bank continued to pull up its drainage rates , increasing the 3 - day reverse repo maximum rate to 22 . 45 perent and the 182 - day bill yield to 22 . 50 percent . Earlier this week it pulled up its benchmark 14 - day drainage rate by 0 . 44 to 22 . 59 percent . - - Wojciech Moskwa + 48 22 653 9700

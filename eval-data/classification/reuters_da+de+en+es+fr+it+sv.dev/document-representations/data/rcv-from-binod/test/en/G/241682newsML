Serbian court rejects first opposition complaints . [ CORRECTED 09 : 50 GMT 8 / 12 ] The Serbian Supreme Court started handing down its verdicts on disputed local elections on Saturday and early rulings appeared to go against the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition . " The court has ruled on five out of 46 electoral districts and dismissed the opposition ' s complaints , " an official of the Democratic Party , a member of Zajedno , told Reuters late on Saturday . " Having in view the fact that our complaints to the Court are identical for all 46 electoral districts , we have no reason to believe the court will rule in any different way for the remaining 41 districts , " he said . The official confirmed an earlier report by independent Belgrade radio B - 92 that the Court has started turning down the appeals . ( Corrects number of electoral districts from 50 to 46 ) The radio quoted Milica Nedeljkovic , Zajedno ' s representative in the City Election Commission , as saying : " The Commission has received rulings by the Court endorsing an earlier decision by a lower court to annul elections results in five districts . " Zajedno claimed victory in Belgrade and 14 other Serbian towns in local elections on November 17 but the ruling Socialist Party said there had been voting irregularities and a Belgrade municipal court annulled election results in the capital . Tens of thousands of people have protested for the past 18 days in Belgrade against the annulment of the opposition victories which has drawn sharp criticism from the West .

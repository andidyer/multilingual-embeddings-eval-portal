Bob Dole - - classic story of poverty to power . By Alan Elsner , U . S . Political CorrespondentBob Dole has travelled a classic American journey from poverty in the Great Depression , through European battlefields to the corridors of power . But his last mission - - to be elected U . S . president at age 73 - - seems doomed to failure as polls show him running far behind President Bill Clinton , a 50 - year - old emblem of a post - war " baby - boom " generation very different from Dole ' s . A plain - speaking man from the plains of Kansas , Dole found himself fighting uphill against an incumbent president bolstered by a favourable economy and a flare for campaigning . Pragmatic , phlegmatic , sardonic , taciturn , modest , sometimes inarticulate , Dole often seemed out of tune with a TV - generation electorate that seemed to value Clinton ' s charisma and relative youth over Dole ' s homespun virtues . Now Dole , who in May gambled by quitting the Senate to run fulltime for the presidency , leaving an institution he said he loved above any other , may face a future of unwanted leisure - - grim for a man with few interests outside politics . He gave perhaps his most inspiring and coherent explanation of his core beliefs in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination in August . " Let me be a bridge to an America that only the unknowing call a myth , " Dole said . " Let me be a bridge to a time of tranquility , faith and confidence in action . To those who say it was never so , that America has not been better , I say , you ' re wrong , and I know because I was there . I have seen it . I remember . " But Clinton cleverly seized on the speech and turned it around , declaring that he wanted to " build a bridge to the 21st century " - - a phrase he made the mantra of his campaign . Dole proved willing to take risks in his White House quest . In August , he turned his back on long dedication to budget - balancing and proposed a $ 548 billion tax - cut package . The man , who as a child in Kansas knew neighbours who committed suicide because of debt , became a latter day convert to the proposition that economic growth should come first and debt would take care of itself . But the 15 percent income tax cut never caught fire with voters and eroded Dole ' s credibility . He did win praise for his bold choice of bitter rival Jack Kemp - - a tax - cut champion - - as his running mate . That gave his campaign a short - lived jolt of energy and momentum . As the campaign wore on and little seemed to work , Dole became increasingly strident , attacking Clinton for his ethical standards on a range of issues . " The goal is always to conceal ethical failure , not confront it . We hear , not apologies , but alibis . The buck stops nowhere , " Dole said of the Clinton administration . He began his third run for the White House in April 1995 , 50 years to the week after he was wounded as a U . S . Army second lieutenant in Italy . He led an assault on a German machinegun nest and a shell destroyed his right shoulder , paralysed his right arm , broke vertebrae , riddled his body with shrapnel and robbed him of a kidney . Twice decorated for heroism , he spent 39 months in hospitals before returning to civilian life . He went to law school , unable to write and getting through with the help of his first wife who transcribed lecture notes for him . Announcing his candidacy , Dole said he was embarking on " one last mission " for his generation . He lost the key New Hampshire primary in February to conservative firebrand Pat Buchanan , but kept his cool and relied on his superior organisation , money and the support of the Republican establishment . Buchanan and other rivals - - who attacked Dole savagely and may have done him permanent damage for the fight with Clinton - - were driven from the field . Having exhausted his funds in the bitter nomination battle , Dole was unable to buy TV advertising until federal campaign subsidies arrived in late summer , leaving Clinton free to build up a huge lead Dole has never really reduced . Robert Joseph Dole was born on July 22 , 1923 , one of four children of a grain elevator manager in Russell , Kansas . After the war he became a lawyer and joined politics . He won a House of Representatives seat in 1960 and a Senate seat in 1968 . Twice serving as Senate Majority Leader , he was an effective middle - road legislator , well liked among Democrats as well as Republicans for his ability to build coalitions and pass broadly acceptable laws . He was a passionate advocate for the rights of the disabled and helped repair the finances of the Social Security programme that provides pensions for retired people . Dole twice sought the Republican nomination without success in 1980 and 1988 , and was then - President Gerald Ford ' s vice presidential running mate in 1976 . It was in that losing campaign that he acquired a reputation as a bitter - edged hatchet man , a reputation he never seemed able to shake . Once divorced , in 1975 he married Elizabeth Hanford , who has been a federal trade commissioner and transportation and labour secretary in Republican Cabinets and is now on leave as president of the American Red Cross . He has one daughter , Robin , from his first marriage .

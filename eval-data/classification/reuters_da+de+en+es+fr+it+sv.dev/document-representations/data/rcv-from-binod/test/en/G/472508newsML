Azerbaijan president raps Armenia before talks . President Haydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan attacked the appointment of a politician from Nagorno - Karabakh as Armenian prime minister on Thursday on the eve of talks with the Armenian president in Moscow . On a one - day visit to Paris , Aliyev discussed the conflict between his country and Armenia over the ethnic Armenian region of Azerbaijan with President Jacques Chirac and welcomed French mediation efforts . He told reporters he had agreed to meet Armenian President Levon Ter - Petrosyan in Moscow on Friday after both men attend a summit of former Soviet republics grouped in the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) . Asked about the appointment of the leader of Karabakh ' s Armenian community , Robert Kocharyan , as Armenian prime minister Aliyev said : " This is an extraordinarily negative factor . " He said Chirac had agreed with him that Kocharyan could not simultaneously hold both the position of president of the Armenian community of Karabakh and prime minister of Armenia . Aliyev said Kocharyan was not even an Armenian citizen . He also criticised the continued presence of Russian troops in Armenia and Georgia , saying such a deployment was especially unnecessary in the light of Moscow ' s economic problems . " The fact that we refused to keep Russian troops on our soil proves our policy of independence . . . There is no need today for Russian troops on Azerbaijani soil , nor do I think there is a reason to have them on Armenian or Georgian territory , " he said . " I don ' t think it ' s right and I even protest against that . " France is one of three co - chairmen of the so - called Minsk group mandated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to seek a solution to the Nagorno - Karabakh conflict . French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is to travel to Baku , Yerevan and Turkey next week to promote peace efforts . After meeting Aliyev , he told reporters that France , Russia and the United States , the three co - chairmen , were united in their determination to find an equitable solution soon . " Nothing is more important than advancing a solution to the problem of Nagorno - Karabakh , " he said . Officials of the Minsk group and the parties to the dispute are due to hold a new round of talks next Tuesday in Moscow . Moslem Azerbaijan and Christian Armenia have been at odds for nine years over the disputed territory , whose Armenian population have fought against rule by Baku . Fighting between Azeris and Armenians killed thousands before a ceasefire was agreed in 1994 . Armenia has offered to free Azeri prisoners taken in fighting over the Nagorno - Karabakh enclave as a unilateral gesture of goodwill ahead of the Moscow talks .

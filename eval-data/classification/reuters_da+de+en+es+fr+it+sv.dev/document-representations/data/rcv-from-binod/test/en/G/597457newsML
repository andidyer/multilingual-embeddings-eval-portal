FEATURE - Child victims speak out of apartheid horrors . A terrified 10 - year - old boy hugged his baby sister to his chest as he lay under his grandparents ' bed listening to a gunman shoot dead his grandmother in South Africa ' s Zulu province six years ago . The small boy , known only as Mdu , stared hard at his feet as he spoke about the attack on a rural homestead on KwaZulu - Natal ' s south coast that changed his life forever . " My grandmother was shot in the hand and chest . The empty shells hit me on the forehead while I was hiding under the bed with my baby sister . My grandmother died right there ( in the bedroom ) , " Mdu said in Zulu . He could not say for sure why his grandparents were targetted , but speculated it was related to the conflict between South Africa ' s largest black political parties , the African National Congress ( ANC ) and the Inkatha Freedom Party . With his father dead and his mother missing , only his grandmother could afford to send him to school . Since her death in 1991 he has not had any schooling and now works as a gardener to keep himself alive . CHILDREN EXPRESS PAIN THROUGH DRAWINGSMdu was one of 50 child victims attending a recent special Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing for KwaZulu - Natal children who were traumatised by political violence during the apartheid era . The youngest was six years . The hearing , the first of its kind , was intended to allow children to tell their stories to Archbishop Desmond Tutu ' s commission , which was set up to probe 30 years of human rights abuses by all sides under apartheid . The children are also being prompted to express their trauma by drawing pictures , since many of them , especially the younger ones , do not possess the linguistic skills to talk about their experiences . KwaZulu - Natal has experienced a low - key civil war for over a decade , involving security forces fighting black liberation movements and an intense turf war between President Nelson Mandela ' s ANC and Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi ' s Inkatha . Violence in KwaZulu - Natal , home to nine million Zulus , was marked by massacres of entire families and the torching of homesteads . More than 14 , 000 people have been killed in the province . If children themselves did not fall victim to the violence , they were affected when their parents were targetted by either the state ' s security forces or by rival political organisations . A former Inkatha member and self - confessed killer Patrick Hlongwane told Reuters it had been a policy of the warlords to kill everybody , including children , during an attack on political rivals . " We were told when you kill a snake you must destroy all its eggs also , " Hlongwane said . Children 12 years and older were usually identified as political activists by police and assaulted to give information on the then - banned liberation movements , said an observer . " Other children became directly involved in political violence because they were frustrated by apartheid and had seen what it had done to their parents ' lives . It gave them something active to do , " said Anne McKay , coordinator of a programme for survivors of violence . She said between 1984 and 1986 the security forces killed 300 children , wounded 1 , 000 and detained 173 , 000 more . Only 25 percent of those children held in jail were ever tried in court , McKay said . Under state of emergency regulations people could be detained for up to 90 days without trial . " The state of emergency regulations allowed security forces to disregard all legislation that protected children . . . and allowed them to forcibly remove children from their homes and communities , and detain them in prison , " McKay said . STATE PAYS FOR SCHOOLING OF CHILD VICTIMSThe government recently allocated 100 million rand ( $ 22 . 5 million ) towards the orphans of the conflict and the refugees it created in KwaZulu - Natal , where monitors estimate more than 500 , 000 people have been displaced . Truth commission spokesman Phinda Khuzwayo said Mdu would be put in a special schooling programme for the rest of this year before being sent back to school next year with fees to be paid by the commission ' s reparations committee . " One of the worst things about this violence was that so many children have lost their education . . . But we are trying to link a number of government departments to help us put this right , " Khuzwayo said .

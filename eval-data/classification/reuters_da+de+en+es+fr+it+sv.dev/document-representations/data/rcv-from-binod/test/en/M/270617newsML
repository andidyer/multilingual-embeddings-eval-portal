Bullish on Europe , J . P Morgan bets on Spain for EMU . J . P . Morgan on Friday posted a bullish outlook for European equity markets in 1997 , forecasting up to 20 percent growth and betting on Spain being among the first nations to join European Monetary Union ( EMU ) . " Lower than expected interest rates and our forecast of strong growth through 1997 and 1998 makes us positive about European equity markets for 1997 , " it said in a statement . " We are forecasting returns of 10 to 20 percent , which we believe to be cautious . " It added that its targets could be upgraded if its economic growth outlook was confirmed by a strong second quarter growth rebound . JP Morgan said it had reduced its weighting in Italy from overweight to neutral so as to strengthen its exposure to Spain on the expectation of Spain joining EMU in 1999 . " We have reinforced our weighting in Spain in the expectation of stronger growth and a good chance that Spain will enter EMU in the first round , " it said . " We are financing a higher weighting in Spain by cutting our weighting in Italy to neutral , " it said , adding the peripheral markets would experience high volatility during 1997 . A J . P . Morgan official said Italy ' s poor GDP growth rate would undermine its attempt to make significant progress towards Maastrict next year . It is forecasting 1 . 1 pct GDP growth for Italy in 1997 against 3 . 2 percent in Spain and a European average of 2 . 5 percent . JP Morgan said it would retain its core underweighting of France against an overweighting of Germany since Germany was likely to offer both growth and corporate restructuring . Restructuring was set to remain a major feature of the European corporate landscape during 1997 , with significant dividend increases a possible surprise as companies return excess cash to shareholders . Sector selection would follow three themes - - buying into the growth rebound through cyclicals ; slowly accumulating consumer stocks ; and gaining exposure to restructuring or its payoff , it said . " Our key ' Buy ' recommendations are AGF , BASF , Danone , Elf Aquitaine , Metro and Norsk Hydro , " it added . - - Caroline Brothers , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 2734

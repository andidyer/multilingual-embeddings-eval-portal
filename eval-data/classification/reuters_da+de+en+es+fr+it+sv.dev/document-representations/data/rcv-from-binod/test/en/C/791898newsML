Neste , IVO quiet on merger talk . Finnish state - controlled oil , chemicals and energy group Neste and state - owned power producer Imatran Voima on Monday declined comment on renewed merger talk , saying the situation would be clearer by the end of August . Both companies said the investment banks each had appointed to study the feasibility of cooperation , or a merger , had informed the ministry of trade and industry of their findings .

Salomon Brothers had submitted a feasibility study on the merger , he said , adding IVO had forwarded it to the ministry .

" The reporting is an ongoing process with some reports already produced and delivered , but not yet completed , " she said .

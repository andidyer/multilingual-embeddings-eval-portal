Forex , rate hike jitters sink South African markets . Delays in abolishing exchange controls and fears of higher interest rates sank South African industrial shares for the ninth consecutive session on Tuesday while government bonds tumbled to a five - month low . Analysts and dealers said the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ( JSE ) has lost over three percent of its value since the end of October as investors hover on the sidelines , scared of being burnt by further rand devaluation . " There is a change of view that the exchange rate is under pressure due to the Reserve Bank ' s policy of not letting go ( of exchange controls ) , " said Gad Ariovich , investment strategy manager at stockbroker SMK Securities . Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals on Friday ruled out a one - off or " big - bang " approach to abolishing controls , saying it would be a gradual process which could take four to five years . Foreign investors , who account for over 50 percent of the JSE ' s turnover , were especially loathe to re - enter the market in the wake of the latest comments on controls , dealers said . " Overseas people are not interested in buying South African stocks at the moment until there is some stability in the rand , " said the head of a leading investment house . " And the perception is that there is not going to be stability until exchange controls go . " The rand has lost some 30 percent of its value against the dollar this year . It was last trading around 4 . 70 to the U . S . unit , off its worst ever level of 4 . 77 hit two weeks ago . But dealers said the currency remained vulnerable to further speculative attacks given the country ' s low reserves . At the same time , stocks and bonds have been pounded by fears of an interest rate hike as the daily money market shortage shoots up , held above the nine billion rand ( $ 1 . 9 billion ) by a liquidity crunch as investors shun South African assets . Yields on South Africa ' s key R150 long bond on Tuesday jumped above 16 . 20 percent for the first time since the end of May . Short - term money market rates are now discounting more than a one percentage point rise in South African lending rates - - already among the highest in the world at 11 percent , after taking account of inflation . Fears of a further upward move in the key Bank rate , currently 16 percent , and commercial banks ' prime rate , 19 . 25 percent , has taken its toll on consumers and in turn on consumer - related companies ' profits . Worse - than - expected half - year results have recently been posted by companies which have fingered slowing domestic demand for their woes . Carmen Maynard , managing director of Fleming Marting Asset Management said : " The natural progression for me is the weaker rand threatening higher interest rates threatening a slower economy threatening weaker corporate profits . " The outlook for the stock and bond market in 1997 remains bleak amid predictions of a further slowdown in growth in gross domestic product to between two and 2 . 5 percent , from an expected three percent this year and 3 . 3 percent in 1995 . That paints a bleak picture for the JSE , according to Sandra Gordon , economist with fund manager Syfrets . " The anticipated slowdown in the domestic economy is expected to cap the market ' s upside , " she predicted this week . ( $ = 4 . 7 rand )

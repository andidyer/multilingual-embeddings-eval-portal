Chirac ' s office denies Juppe threatened to quit . French President Jacques Chirac ' s office denied on Friday a report in the conservative daily Le Figaro that Prime Minister Alain Juppe had threatened to resign over sniping in their Gaullist RPR party . The newspaper , which backs the centre - right government , said Juppe had gone to the Elysee presidential palace on Thursday and pressed Chirac to restore order in the party , saying he would otherwise boycott the RPR ' s annual parliamentary conference . It quoted some unidentified Gaullist deputies as saying Juppe had even threatened to resign . An official source in the president ' s office called the report " pure fabrication " . The source said it was Chirac who took the initiative of telephoning RPR parliamentary floor leader Michel Pericard to voice indignation at the criticism of Juppe and authorised him to convey that message to the media and the conference . " Alain Juppe did not come here , nor did he even call the president , " he said . The source said Chirac ' s call to order was aimed at the entire centre - right coalition , whose junior partner , the Union for French Democracy ( UDF ) , also criticised Juppe this week . Chirac ' s intervention in coalition affairs was highly unusual since France ' s Fifth Republic constitution places the head of state above party politics . Le Figaro said Juppe had been particularly outraged by veteran Gaullist parliamentarian Pierre Mazeaud criticising on television his recent initiatives to strengthen anti - racism laws and reform the electoral system . On Wednesday , maverick RPR back - bencher Etienne Garnier called Juppe an " irreparable prime minister . . . whose dogmatism and clumsiness are leading the country towards insurmountable problems and unacceptable inequality . " And in a speech to the parliamentarians on Thursday , former prime minister Edouard Balladur hit out at his successor ' s moves on anti - racism laws and proportional representation , and urged him to modify his economic policies .

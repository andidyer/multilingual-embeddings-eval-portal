Japan not told , but thanks Peru for hostage rescue . Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was caught unaware of Peru ' s attack to end a prolonged siege of the Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima but thanked President Alberto Fujimori for taking the gamble . " I told President Fujimori that if I had been in his position I would have done the same , " Hashimoto told a news conference on Wednesday after speaking to Fujimori by telephone . " I told him I understood his choice although I did inform him of my regret that we had no prior information , " Hashimoto said . In an earlier news conference soon after Peruvian troops stormed the residence held by Marxist rebels , it was a clearly irritated and abruptly awoken Hashimoto who expressed his regret at the lack of advanced warning . " We unfortunately were not told of the operation before the move . I regret this , but we thank the Peruvian authorities for seizing the chance , " Hashimoto said . Hashimoto said Fujimori had told him the Lima government could not have given advance warning because of the " delicate situation " . Fujimori also thanked the Japanese people for trusting him and his government over the four - month affair . Japan persistently sought a peaceful end to the hostage drama , but maintained throughout the crisis that it would stand by any decision by the Peruvian government . Hashimoto said all 24 Japanese hostages , including Japanese ambassador to Peru Morihisa Aoki , were rescued . He paid respects to the families of the one Peruvian hostage and two soldiers killed in the attack . " Thankfully , all Japanese nationals were rescued and those injured were only slightly hurt . But I offer condolences to the families of the one hostage and two soldiers who were killed in the operation . " We were truly hoping for a peaceful solution , but that is a notion of someone who is far away at a place where there is a 14 - hour time difference , " Hashimoto said . " How can anyone criticise President Fujimori ? It is not important whether we had prior knowledge of the move . The important thing is that the hostages were freed . " Hashimoto said Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda would leave Tokyo later on Wednesday for Lima to conduct a probe of the entire affair , reopen the Japanese embassy and hold talks with Peruvian authorities . " We have also arranged for psychiatrists to be sent to Lima to treat trauma of the hostages held for such a long time , " Hashimoto said . Hashimoto said aides awoke him minutes after the first shots were fired by Peruvian troops storming the residence . The assault started at around 5 . 23 a . m . Japan time on Wednesday ( 2023 GMT Tuesday ) . All Japanese television stations covered the raid live from Lima . Only on Tuesday , Hashimoto said he received a letter from the top siege mediator , Roman Catholic Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani , urging Japan to press for a peaceful end to the crisis . Hashimoto ' s aides said Cipriani ' s plea was based on concerns that hardliners in Fujimori ' s government had put pressure on the Peruvian government to storm the residence .

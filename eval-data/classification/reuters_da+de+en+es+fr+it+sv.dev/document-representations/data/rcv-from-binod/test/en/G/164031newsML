Zaire ' s Mobutu rests in French Riviera villa . Zaire ' s ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko rested in a French Riviera villa on Monday after flying from Switzerland for what his spokesman said would be a short stay before returning to chaos at home . The 66 - year - old president drove amid tight security from Nice airport to his personal pink and white marble villa in Roquebrune - Cap - Martin overlooking the Mediterranean as his country teetered on the brink of disintegration . " We ' re tired after a long trip , " a Zairean official told reporters by intercom at the gate of the sprawling estate , where the four - storey villa nestles out of view from the road on one of the choicest spots of the Riviera . Outside the gates , bodyguards shoved reporters and seized film from cameras , journalists said . In Kinshasa , Mobutu ' s spokesman said the president would soon return to Zaire , grappling with a Tutsi rebellion that has uprooted more than a million refugees with little food or water . French diplomatic sources said Mobutu , who has an open visa to visit France , would stay for a few days before heading home . There was no plan for him to meet French President Jacques Chirac who was in Marseille , about 200 km ( 120 miles ) west of Nice , for a two - day summit with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar . At the summit , France and Spain proposed a multi - national force to guarantee distribution of aid to refugees in Zaire . Chirac and Aznar agreed to " unite their efforts " and prepare a " temporary effort to ensure security " in eastern Zaire . " The two countries will take part in an international meeting to prepare this operation to which they are prepared to contribute and which should be decided by the U . N . Security Council , " the two said in a statement . The two said they would act with other European nations , the United States , the U . N . and the Organisation of African Unity . They urged both Rwanda and Zaire not to place obstacles in the way of distributing humanitarian aid . The United Nations said that Raymond Chretien , the new U . N . envoy to the eastern Zaire crisis , expected to see Mobutu in France this week . Chretien , Canada ' s ambassador to Washington , was due to leave for Nice on Tuesday . Mobutu had been in Switzerland since August when he underwent surgery for prostate cancer at the University Hospital in Lausanne . His spokesman Kabuya Lumana said on television in Zaire that no further medical examinations were expected . Mobutu arrived in Nice aboard a four - engined DC - 8 aircraft specially designed for him and which can carry several dozen people , an airport spokesman said . He made no statement on arrival and was whisked off to his villa , which he bought a decade ago from a Saudi millionaire . Mobutu last visited in 1993 , when he came to France for dental treatment . Officials in Paris said earlier they did not know Mobutu was arriving . Mobutu , a one - time army sergeant who seized power in 1965 , had been living with his entourage of more than 20 at Lausanne ' s luxury Beau - Rivage Palace hotel , but Swiss authorities were understood to have asked him to avoid public appearances or interviews .

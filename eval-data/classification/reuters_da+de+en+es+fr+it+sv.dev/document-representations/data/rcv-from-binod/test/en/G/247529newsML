Belarus police use batons on ' Big Mac ' hunters . Police beat students with truncheons as they descended on the first McDonald ' s restaurant in Belarus Tuesday , marring the fast food chain ' s entry into its 100th country or territory . Rumours that the first customers would get free food or a prize attracted thousands of people who tried to squeeze through the doors until dozens of special police stopped them and set up barriers . About 4 , 000 people , many of them students keen to try their first " Big Mac , " filled the central avenue of the capital of the former Soviet republic as its first McDonald ' s opened at midnight . Cheers mixed with screams as fireworks ripped through the air and riot police with truncheons tried to stop the crowds from crushing their way into the restaurant . Officials from the fast food giant appealed to the crowd through loudspeakers not to push forward and threatened to close the restaurant . McDonald ' s is charging the equivalent of $ 1 for a Big Mac in a country where the average monthly wage is about $ 50 . " Stuff the police with hamburgers ! " one young woman in the crowd shouted . " I was waiting for fireworks , but not this kind of fireworks , " said Sergei Patskevich , a student who said he was hit by a truncheon . The pushing and shoving lasted about an hour . Belarus , a country of 10 million people between Russia and Poland , is struggling for foreign investment and a senior official welcomed the arrival of McDonald ' s , describing it as a " kind of indicator of western investments . " McDonald ' s boasted Monday that it would expand into its 100th and 101st countries and territories Tuesday by opening restaurants in Minsk and in Papeete , Tahiti . Three restaurants were being opened in Minsk and another four were planned for other regional centres by 1998 .

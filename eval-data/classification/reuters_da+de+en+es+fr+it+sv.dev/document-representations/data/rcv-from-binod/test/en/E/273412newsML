Algeria adopts ' 97 budget with $ 1 . 5 billion deficit . Algeria ' s appointed parliamentary body on Monday approved a 1997 budget projecting a 84 . 7 billion dinar ( $ 1 . 54 billion ) deficit , Algerian state - run television said . The television showed Transitional National Council members approving the budget by show of hands in front of Finance Minister Abdelkrim Harchaoui and other ministers . The budget envisages receipts of 829 . 4 billion dinars , 19 . 3 billion dinars more than last year , against expenditures of 914 . 1 billion dinars , 72 . 5 billion dinars up on the 1996 budget . Taxes on the gas and oil sectors provide more than half the receipts at 451 billion dinars , slightly down from last year ' s 485 . 6 billion , the official data showed . The official Algerian news agency APS said earlier the budget was based on oil sales at $ 17 . 5 per barrel for 1997 in comparison to $ 16 . 5 per barrel in 1996 . Algerian oil sales in the international market averaged about $ 22 per barrel in 1996 , producing a windfall for authorities locked in a five - year conflict with radical Moslem fundamentalists . APS said the budget aims to stimulating investment and improving production through incentives like cuts in Value Added Tax for companies of up to 7 percent . More than 100 billion dinars is to go to Algerian industry outside the oil and gas sector . That area has already swallowed more than 650 billion dinars from the state in the past six years . Production by state - owned industry outside the oil and gas sectors fell by 7 . 4 percent in the first half of 1996 . The government is striving to shift toward the free market under a three - year accord with the International Monetary Fund begun in 1995 . Gross Domestic Product grew more than four percent in 1995 and the first half of 1996 , reversing falls in 1993 and 1994 . ( $ 1 = 55 dinars )

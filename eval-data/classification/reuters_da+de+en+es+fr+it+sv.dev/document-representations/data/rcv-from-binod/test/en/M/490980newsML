ASIAN DEBT MARKETS - World Bank tackles HK $ mart . The World Bank took on a tough market with a HK $ 1 . 0 billion fixed rate bond on Monday . The 10 - year bond pays a quarterly coupon of 7 . 58 percent and was priced and re - offered at par to yield an annual 7 . 7982 percent , or 33 basis points over the 6 . 89 percent Hong Kong Exchange Fund Note due January 2007 . HSBC Markets was lead manager . " It probably will sell reasonably well but it won ' t be flying out the door , " said a syndicate manager at a European bank , adding " people are too worried about the direction of interest rates in the U . S . Many economists are betting that the U . S . Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again after it lifted the key fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 . 50 percent in March in a bid to quell inflationary pressures . Bankers also said that a narrowing of spreads between Hong Kong and U . S . government paper means that the bond , while reasonably priced versus EFNs , is less attractive when viewed in relation to Treasury yields . " Hong Kong 10 - year government paper is paying less than 50 basis points over Treasuries , so the World Bank bond gives just over 80 basis points versus 10 - year Treasuries , " said another syndicate manager . A dearth of supply , confidence in Hong Kong as the handover to China approaches and a strong Hong Kong dollar are contributing to a contraction of the spread , he said . Bankers said the 10 - year EFN was paying a premium over Treasuries of closer to 100 basis points when it was launched in January . Anita Fung , manager of domestic markets at HSBC Markets , acknowledged that some investors are concerned about the direction of U . S . interest rates . But she said that a spread of 47 - 50 basis points between Hong Kong and U . S . 10 - year paper is deemed acceptable by many investors . " If the spread were closer to 40 basis points , then people might find it expensive , " she said . Fung pointed out that the World Bank bond is the largest Hong Kong dollar issue to date with a 10 - year tenor . The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued its debut 10 - year bond last October in order to extend the government yield curve . Ten banks in addition to HSBC Markets joined the group . HSBC ' s Fung said institutional investors from Europe , Hong Kong and mainland China have shown interest in the transaction . Bankers also noted that the Hong Kong Housing Authority - - traditionally a big investor in Hong Kong dollar fixed rate paper - - is in the investing mode again after being out of the market for almost year .

The 150 million sterling three - year floating rate note pays a spread of 12 . 5 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate . Fees are 15 basis points .

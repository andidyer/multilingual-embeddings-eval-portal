India ICICI bank plan gets RBI nod - paper . The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd ( ICICI ) has reached an ' in - principle ' agreement with the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on its plan to convert itself into a commercial bank , the Economic Times reported on Wednesday . Formal talks on the proposal will begin in the next few months , it said . ICICI officials were not immediately available for comment . Analysts said that ICICI , India ' s second largest term - lending institution , has for long been aspiring to become a commercial bank , including short - and long - term lending . The specific issues to be sorted out are applicability to ICICI of RBI norms for banks on priority sector lending and the CRR ( cash reserve ratio ) and SLR ( statutory liquidity ratio ) . These rules , if made applicable to ICICI , will hamper its profitability , analysts said . An exemption from these norms to ICICI will be stoutly opposed by banks , they said . The Industrial Development Bank of India , India ' s leading term - lending bank , will continue to concentrate on its core area of term - lending , a top IDBI official said . - - Bombay newsroom + 91 - 22 - 265 9000

NWE naphtha slips as crude falls , spreads narrow . NWE naphtha prices erased their gains to end about $ 1 . 50 lower for prompt supplies after crude and gasoline turned sharply lower on Thursday . Physical trade was lacklustre and some traders said petrochemical demand may cushion further declines as naphtha remains a favourable feedstock . But end user demand was not expected to be robust until mid - month . One trader said Nov / Dec swaps narrowed about $ 1 to a $ 4 . 50 backwardation due to perceptions of adequate near term supply . Early 1997 swaps prices were hit by sellers taking advantage of richer crack spreads , he said .

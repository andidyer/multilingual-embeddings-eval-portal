CYCLING - ROMINGER CONSIDERING ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE RECORD . Tony Rominger of Switzerland will decide in the next two weeks the venue of any attempt he might make to recapture his world one - hour record . The decision lies between Bordeaux in France , where Rominger tested on Saturday , and Manchester , the British track where his record fell to Englishman Chris Boardman last September . " The Manchester track is easier and therefore a little faster for me because it is not so steep as Bordeaux on the bends . I will decide which it is to be in the next two weeks , " said Rominger after six hours of testing at Manchester ' s 250 - metre velodrome on Monday . " It will be very difficult to beat Boardman ' s figures ( 56 . 375 kms ) . After the world road championships in October I will make more tests to see if I am at the level to do it . " I have to get back to my 1994 shape . Only when I am confident about that will I consider attacking the record . " Bordeaux has seen five world hour records since 1993 . Boardman set the pace , followed by Scotsman Graeme Obree and Miguel Indurain of Spain . Then in 1994 Rominger improved it twice in two weeks . Boardman ' s one - hour ride at Manchester , however , added more than a kilometre to Rominger ' s distance .

NAP wins close Thai election by two - seat margin . Thailand ' s interior ministry on Monday officially declared the New Aspiration Party ( NAP ) , led by Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh , the winner of the Sunday election by a thin two - seat majority . The ministry said the NAP grabbed 125 seats in the 393 - seat parliament against 123 won by its archrival , the Democrat Party of former premier Chuan Leekpai . Television stations had earlier projected unofficially that the NAP would win by the same 125 - 123 margin in a tight poll race which analysts said was the most violent and dirty in two decades . Polling was marred by a shooting in which three people were seriously wounded in a western Bangkok suburb . The election watchdog , Pollwatch , said seven people had been killed in the run - up to the polls and politicians had spent an estimated 30 billion baht ( $ 1 . 2 billion ) on vote - buying . Chavalit and Chuan were unavailable for comment immediately after the official results were announced . Earlier , Chavalit had told a news conference after the television projection , flanked by leaders of four other potential coalition partners , that he would be victorious . He also said the leaders of the five parties were appearing together to show they were prepared to work in unison in future . " We are here today to show that we are victorious . . . but we should be patient , taking one step at a time , " Chavalit said . Before Chavalit appeared on television with his potential coalition partners , the Democrats ' Chuan acknowledged unofficial projections that the NAP had edged past his party in the polls . " According to the information that I have followed , the Democrat Party has not emerged as the number one party and therefore we will be in the opposition in the future . . . if the reports prove to be correct , " he said . A Chuan aide later confirmed that if the NAP had won the most seats , it had the right to form the next coalition government . As tradition dictates , the NAP , as the party with the most number of seats , will have the right to form a new coalition government . The NAP ' s four allies , the Chart Thai , the Prachakorn Thai , the Social Action Party and the Muonchon Party control a total of 79 seats . Combined with the 125 won by the NAP , the group of five parties would have a majority of 204 seats in parliament and be able to form the new government , analysts said . Among the leaders of the four parties that appeared with Chavalit was the outgoing premier Banharn Silpa - archa , whose Chart Thai party won 39 seats in the polls . Chavalit had during the campaign proposed to the Democrats that they join together in a national coalition to solve major economic woes and an image problem faced by Thailand . But Chuan spurned the offer , saying that an opposition was needed to monitor the government at all times . The Democrats were allied with the Chart Pattana party of another former premier Chatichai Choonhavan , which came third in the election with 52 seats , and the Seritham party which collected four seats .

" Naturally , we can increase our ties with those countries which follow the principles of mutual respect and trust in their relations with Iran , " he said . European Union countries except Greece recalled their top envoys from Tehran after the April 10 court ruling accusing Iranian leaders of ordering the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin . Iran said it would reciprocate . Australia and New Zealand also recalled their ambassadors , but later said the envoys would return to Tehran . Australia , which is exporting up to three million tonnes of wheat to Iran in the year to June 30 , said on Thursday it would return ambassador Stuart Hume to Iran on Friday .

New Zealand ' s Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said ambassador Daniel Richards would be back in Iran by April 19 . He said on Tuesday he expected confusion over a reported trade ban imposed by Iran in response to Richards ' s recall to be resolved in days .

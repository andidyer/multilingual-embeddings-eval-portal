FORECAST - McDonald ' s Q1 EPS seen higher . Positive U . S . same store sales and continued expansion worldwide are expected to result in a double - digit percentage gain in first quarter earnings for fast - food giant McDonald ' s Corp , analysts said . But the rise in earnings will be crimped by a strong U . S . dollar , which will trim international sales , they added . According to First Call , the mean analyst earnings estimate for the quarter is $ 0 . 50 a share , up from last year ' s $ 0 . 44 before a $ 0 . 02 charge . Share repurchases also helped quarterly earnings per share comparisons , analysts said . Despite the expectations for higher first - quarter earnings , analysts were cautious about McDonald ' s international operations . " International did not have a good quarter , " Natwest Securities analyst Damon Brundage said . " I think weak economies in places like Canada , France and Germany translated into weak sales . " In the United States , McDonald ' s has said its first - quarter same store sales - - measuring results from units open at least a year - - were higher than a year ago . That was its first increase after six consecutive quarterly declines . Analysts said McDonald ' s U . S . sales benefited from recent promotions , such as special price offers for its Chicken McNuggets and its Monopoly in - store game . In the future , McDonald ' s will continue to rely on promotions to boost U . S . sales , although the impact on the bottom line is uncertain . McDonald ' s recently launched its " Campaign 55 " promotion , featuring its breakfast sandwiches for 55 cents when consumers also buy hash browns and a drink . That 55 - cent promotion is expected to feature hamburgers soon . " What they ' re trying to do with Campaign 55 is take advantage of their national advertising power , " Bear Stearns analyst Joseph Buckley said . Everen Securities analyst Dean Haskell said that while Campaign 55 may drive customer traffic , the price discounts may not help the bottom line . " They are discounting further a product that they ' ve already discounted , " Haskell added . Brundage also said that , under Campaign 55 , the average customer check may decline . That compares with about a five to seven percent rise in the average check size in the first quarter , which helped boost U . S . same store sales . McDonald ' s also launched a promotion this month for its Happy Meals for children , giving away mini versions of Ty Inc ' s popular Beanie Babies . As previously reported , the Teenie Beanie Babies could be McDonald ' s biggest Happy Meal promotion of the year .

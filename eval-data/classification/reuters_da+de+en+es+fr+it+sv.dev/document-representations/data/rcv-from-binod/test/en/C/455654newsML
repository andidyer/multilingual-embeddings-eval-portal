UGG directors indefinitely postpone plan . Directors of Winnipeg - based United Grain Growers Ltd on Thursday indefinitely postponed the implementation of a massive share dilution plan . " The Board will not set a ' separation time ' under the ( shareholder ) rights plan in the absence of any new developments , " UGG president and chairman Ted Allen said . UGG shares traded at C $ 12 . 75 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 1517 EST / 2017 GMT as 8 , 079 shares changed hands . " Our view is that this matter is now closed , " Allen said . Alberta Wheat Pool and Manitoba Pool Elevators on February 20 launched a C $ 13 . 75 a share hostile bid for UGG , one of Canada ' s largest grain handlers . They dropped their C $ 172 million offer Tuesday after a Manitoba court ruled UGG ' s poison pill had been triggered . UGG ' s board said it decided to terminate the formal process to solicit possible transactions with third parties which it began in response to the Pools ' offer . UGG said some firms came forward to discuss pursuing negotiations towards a " mutually beneficial transaction . " UGG chief executive Brian Hayward declined to disclose the names of those firms . UGG ' s directors authorized management to continue discussions with some of those firms , " if the talks could lead to an appropriate transaction that would enhance shareholder value . " " Such a transaction could include , among other things , a joint venture , strategic alliance , purchase or sale of assets , and a third - party investment in UGG , " a UGG statement said . " There is no certainty that these discussions would lead to a transaction and UGG may end them at any time , " it said . UGG ' s directors adopted the poison pill Feb 14 granting any shareholder other than a hostile bidder the option to purchase 8 . 5 more shares for each one already held at C $ 5 . 88 each . The plan could be triggered once any one shareholder acquired 15 percent or more of UGG stock . ( ( Gilbert Le Gras 204 947 3548 ) )

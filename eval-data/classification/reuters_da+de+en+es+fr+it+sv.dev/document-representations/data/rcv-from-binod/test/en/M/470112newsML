FOCUS - European bourses shrug off U . S . rate rise . European stock markets on Wednesday shrugged off a rise in U . S . interest rates and a modest fall on Wall Street overnight to push strongly higher . The dollar slipped slightly at the start of European business but traded not far from overnight highs hit following the decision of the U . S . Federal Reserve ' s policy - making open market committee to hike rates by a quarter percentage point . Although the decision was widely expected by the markets , U . S . Treasuries slumped on fears of a further Fed tightening and dragged down European bond markets when they opened . British government gilts opened 14 / 32 lower , with dealers predicting the negative reaction would undermine an auction later in the day of 2 . 5 billion pounds worth of 10 - year bond . Traders said the market was hurt by Fed comments accompanying the rate rise that hinted at more action to come . " It has made the market reassess the future of monetary policy . I think another rate rise pretty soon is now being contemplated , " said one trader in London . Despite that , European equity markets appeared to react with relief after an early wobble . The region ' s biggest bourses in London , Paris and Frankfurt led the way up in a move that was reflected in many smaller markets . German shares made the most progress in early trade , the 30 - share DAX index wiping out pre - bourse weakness to jump 1 . 7 percent by 1030 GMT . Deutsche gained 2 . 55 marks to 93 . 80 after reporting its 1996 results and an optimistic outlook for 1997 . Utility Veba reversed early losses after it said 1996 group pre - tax profit rose 16 percent . Thyssen and Krupp were both again under the spotlight in reaction to Krupp ' s cancelled takeover bid , which is due to make way for a steel joint venture between the two . Thyssen shares were quoted 4 . 5 marks lower at 371 , while Krupp recovered early losses to stand unchanged at 331 marks . In London , the blue chip FTSE 100 index rose around 0 . 7 percent , building on Tuesday ' s rise that broke a six - day losing run . The U . S . rate rise was the main talking point . " The quarter point rise was well flagged and well handled this time around , " said one trader . " The initial reaction was that the ( U . S ) market went better on relief that it was out of the way . " However , with the long Easter weekend approaching and the likelihood of a British rate rise after the May 1 general election , traders said market makers remained wary . Shares of retailer Next , the only FTSE 100 company to report earnings , shot up 28p to 624 after announcing earnings at the top end of expectations . French stocks wobbled at the start but pushed higher by mid - morning , with the CAC - 40 rising 0 . 6 percent by 1030 GMT . " The dollar ' s holding up well , and corporate results aren ' t bad , " one trader said . Shares in Schneider rose 5 . 43 percent to 318 francs after the company reported 1996 net attributable profit surged 61 . 6 percent . On the foreign exchange market , the dollar edged higher against the yen , while the mark ' s overnight strength was capped in morning trade . Even though the dollar is vulnerable to a correction in U . S . asset markets , analysts pointed out that a 1994 - style shake - out was unlikely . The dollar dropped sharply in the aftermath of the U . S . rate rise then , and global bond markets collapsed . " This should be positive for the dollar in the short - term but I would question its ability to rally in the longer - term , given that rate rises are priced in already , " said Tony Norfield at ABN Amro .

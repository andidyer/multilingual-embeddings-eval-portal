Oracle , Netscape to merge Internet access software units . An Oracle Corp . software unit has agreed to buy a company controlled by Netscape Communications Corp . in a bid to beef up the network computer , a key weapon for Oracle in its battle with Microsoft Corp . Oracle said Monday that its Network Computer Inc . ( NCI ) unit will acquire Navio Communications Inc . , which is owned by Netscape and other investors . In return , Oracle , based in Redwood Shores , Calif . , issued an undisclosed number of NCI shares to Netscape and the other investors . Oracle will merge Navio ' s operations - - with its software expertise - - with NCI . The new company will operate under the NCI name . Oracle remains NCI ' s largest shareholder , while Netscape gets a minority stake , the companies said . Financial terms were not disclosed , but Oracle said it expects to take a $ 60 million charge in its fiscal first quarter , ending Aug . 31 , for the transaction . The transaction will help NCI develop cheap devices similar to personal computers that let consumers browse the Internet , the companies said . " Our combined efforts will accelerate the adoption of Network Computers in the consumer , corporate and education markets and make the power of the Internet available to everyone , " said Jerry Baker , NCI ' s chief executive . Network Computers , or NCs , are similar to PCs but have less electronics . Because they get their computing power from corporate or public computer networks , such as the Internet , they are expected to be cheaper to operate than PCs . For the past year , Navio and NCI separately have been developing fundamental software for NCs , NCI aiming its software at corporate customers , Navio at consumers . Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison has been pushing the NC , because the underlying networks would demand Oracle software . Ellison also plans to use the NC as a weapon against Microsoft , since the NC does not need Microsoft Windows or Microsoft applications to operate . Microsoft has taken the threat from NCs and similar cheap computers seriously . Last month , the world ' s biggest personal computer software company agreed to pay $ 425 million to buy WebTV Networks Inc . , a designer of set - top boxes that let consumers browse the Internet through their TV sets . " If you ' re two relative pygmies and you stand on each other ' s shouldars , you have a better chance of swatting the giant , " said Ira Machefsky , vice president at market research firm Giga Information Group in Santa Clara , Calif . Navio executives said they expected to have a device geared toward consumers ready by Christmas . Netscape executives also said they can now concentrate even more on writing Internet software for business customers . Netscape set up Navio last year to develop Internet access software for devices other than PCs . Netscape sold Navio stakes to several other companies but remained the largest shareholder . Netscape shares rose 75 cents to $ 30 and Oracle fell 12 . 5 cents to $ 44 . 25 on Nasdaq .

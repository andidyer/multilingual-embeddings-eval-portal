Israel Labour leader says compromise brings peace . Israeli opposition leader Ehud Barak said on Wednesday the Jewish state must cooperate with the Palestinians and be ready to compromise in order to achieve peace in the Middle East . Barak , who heads the opposition Labour party , met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo and said they had both come to the conclusion that any alternative to peace would be risky . " Overall feeling on both sides is that the peace process is so important and those who have invested so much in it cannot let it down without making whatever could be done to save it , " Barak told reporters . " We need a stable Middle East peace . We need hope it could be achieved and we need it to be implemented the sooner the better . The alternatives won ' t serve anyone , they ' re risky . " Egypt has taken over mediating between the Palestinians and the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to break a five - month freeze in peace talks . Israeli - Palestinian negotiations have been suspended since Israel began constructing a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem on Arab lands Israel occupied in the 1967 war . The Palestinians refuse to restart talks until building work stops . Israel says it wants more security guarantees before it can negotiate with the Palestinians . Barak , who was foreign minister in the previous Labour government of prime minister Shimon Peres , reluctantly told reporters that he strongly supported the right of Israelis to build settlements , but not on Arab land . He said the Jewish state , however , should have control over these settlers wherever they are . " We strongly believe in the right of Israelis to settle when it ' s not on Arab property and we believe that . . . we must have all the settlers and not necessarily the settlements under our sovereignty , " he said . But he added : " We must be ready to compromise in order to achieve peace . We want to separate from the Palestinians , we want them to shape their own lives . We can ' t choose our neighbours but we must nurture respect and mutual cooperation . " Netanyahu has raised the ire of the Arab world and many European states by adamantly building settlements and refusing to trade occupied Arab lands for peace - - one of the main principles agreed for the 1991 Madrid peace conference . Egypt has lobbied extensively to put an end to what it sees as Israeli activities damaging to peace . It called for Tuesday ' s special U . N . meeting on the subject . Barak held separate talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa late on Tuesday to exchange their views on the peace process . Moussa and Barak advocated a larger role for the European Union in the peace negotiations , which have been dominated by the United States , seen by Arabs as biased towards Israel .

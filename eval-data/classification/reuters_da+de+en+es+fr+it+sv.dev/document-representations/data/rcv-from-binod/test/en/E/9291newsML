Brazil govt aid to states at 3 . 2 bln reais - paper . The Brazilian federal government has already awarded 3 . 2 billion reais ( $ 3 . 2 billion ) in aid to financially troubled states and the figure is expected to be much higher by the end of the year , a newspaper said . The government aid has been disbursed in the form of loans from federal banks , Caixa Economica Federal and Brazil ' s National Development Bank ( BNDES ) , O Globo said . State debts have already helped undermine the federal government ' s 1996 public sector deficit target of 3 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . The BNDES has already signed loan agreements with Rio de Janeiro , Minas Gerais , Rio Grande do Sul , Bahia and Alagoas states , and is negotiating with Rio Grande do Norte , Sergipe , Maranhao , Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul . The BNDES loans are not enough , however , to cover the states ' deficits and the situation is expected to get worse with the costs involved in the upcoming municipal elections , O Globo said . - - Simona de Logu , Rio de Janeiro newsroom , 5521 507 4151

Flores & Rucks ups 1997 drilling budget . Flores & Rucks Inc said on Monday it increased its 1997 drilling budget by 33 percent to $ 200 million . The increase was funded by additional cash flow from anticipated increases in production , as well as through the realization of higher than anticipated commodity prices and the possible disposition of non - strategic assets . " With our current project inventory and unique ability to bring on production quickly because of our existing large production infrastructure , we are well positioned to take advantage of the higher commodity pricing currently enjoyed by the industry , " James Flores , chairman and chief executive officer , said . " As such , we believe it is prudent to capitalize on the favorable market conditions which exist by increasing our planned 1997 activities , " he said . - - New York newsdesk 212 - 859 - 1610

Ahold bolsters global ambitions with Brazil deal . Dutch food retailer Ahold NV underlined its global ambitions on Monday by announcing plans to take a 50 percent stake in Brazilian supermarket chain Bompreco , its first incursion into South America . Ahold said Bompreco was the fourth largest food retailer in Brazil and market leader in the northeast of the country with 1995 sales of about $ 1 . 4 billion . The Dutch group said it would finance the acquisition from its available funds but gave no further financial details . It said the deal would not dilute earnings in the first year and was expected to enhance earnings per share thereafter . Bompreco concluded an international share offering last week , selling nine million non - voting preferred shares to investors in Brazil , the U . S . and Europe at a price of $ 8 . 25 each . These shares are listed in Brazil and Luxembourg . Ahold said it and Bompreco planned considerable expansion in the north and northeast of Brazil in the coming years . The Brazilian company currently operates seven hypermarkets , 29 supermarkets , 11 minimarkets and three department stores which will be remodelled into hypermarkets . Ahold has annual sales of about $ 24 billion in the U . S . , the Netherlands and other European countries . Earlier this year it roughly doubled its turnover in the U . S . by acquiring the U . S . supermarkets chain Stop & Shop . This year also marked Ahold ' s expansion into Asia where it has set up joint ventures in Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore and China . Ahold board member Fritz Ahlqvist said the Brazilian deal reflected the company ' s plans to become one of the world ' s leading food retailers . " We already have very strong operations in Europe and the United States and have started in the emerging markets of Asia , " he said . " This opportunity to join forces with a highly respected and successful Brazilian company provides a flying start for Ahold in Latin America , " he added . Ahold ' s move caught analysts off guard . " We had been looking for further expansion through joint ventures , but not in Brazil , " said John David Roeg , retail analyst with Bank Labouchere . " It ' s a surprising and daring move , " said ING Barings ' Dennis Jullens . " With this step , Ahold has gained a foothold in Latin America ' s biggest and most developed market " .

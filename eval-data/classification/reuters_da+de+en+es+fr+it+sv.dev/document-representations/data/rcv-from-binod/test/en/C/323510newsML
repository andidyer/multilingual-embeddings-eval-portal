Moody ' s sees strains on large German banks . German bank earnings will come under greater pressure but the firms will generally remain creditworthy , Moody ' s Investors Service said in a report on Tuesday . The agency said individual downward rating changes will probably occur . Moody ' s said there will be " more pressure on the banks ' earnings " and that " strains will be inevitable as the structures within the industry evolve " . " Among the stresses on Europe ' s strongest banking system are embedded heavy costs , shifts in corporate and private customer expectations , and intensifying competition - - all of which are squeezing profitability hard , " Moody ' s said . It said the old structures are shifting beneath the feet of the nation ' s famously conservative bank managements . " Faced with an increasingly integrated European system and currency union , as well as changes in customer needs , preferences and behaviors , it is easy to see that the fundamentals of the system are changing , and that Germany ' s banks are scrambling to keep up , " the report said . Moody ' s said top - rated groups are not immune from pressures . " This view is reflected in 1996 downgrades - - to Aa1 from Aaa of both Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank - - and also by the negative outlook on the ratings of several other institutions . " The phenomena affecting these large credit institutions may , in time , work into other levels of the system , the report said . The agency said intensifying competition has strained bank relations between , and within , sectors that were used to having cordial relationships characterized by much mutual support . Moody ' s also expects more pressure on the business franchises of private mortgage banks . " The German system is Europe ' s most fragmented , " Moody ' s said , with large market shares held by the savings and cooperative sectors . " The consolidation process , which could serve to chop costs , is being slowed down by numerous political and regulatory hurdles , " the report said . But on average , Moody ' s said Germany ' s big universal banks are well sustained by enviable business franchises and by good financials . " Disclosed solvency ratios may be low when compared to international market standards , but they are often enhanced by hidden reserves and by stable financials overall . "

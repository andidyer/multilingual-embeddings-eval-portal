FERC backs Pony Express switch to natgas pipeline . The U . S . Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday approved K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co ' s plan to convert the Pony Express oil pipeline into a natural gas pipeline . K N Interstate is a subsidiary of K N Energy Inc . The pipeline would operate in Wyoming , Colorado , Nebraska , Kansas and Missouri , carrying natural gas produced in the Rocky Mountain area to Mid - Continent markets . " The Pony Express project brings significant reserves to market in an area where there is inadequate capacity , " said Commissioner James Hoecker . Commissioners praised the project , saying the company would save about $ 60 million by converting the oil pipeline instead of building a new pipeline , which in turn would allow it to lower rates to all its customers .

Iran 1997 - 1998 oil revenue to hit $ 18 bln - minister . Iran is expected to earn $ 18 billion in oil revenue in the next Iranian year , starting March 21 , Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh was quoted on Tuesday as saying . Aghazadeh told the English - language Iran News newspaper that estimated earnings were based on a budget price of $ 17 . 50 a barrel from the sale of 2 . 5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude oil and additional exports of refined products . Oil is Iran ' s largest single earner , contributing 41 percent to state budgeted revenue . He also stressed the importance of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and issued an indirect warning to producers outside the group . " OPEC is an important organisation to establish oil prices and the absence of this organisation would create disorder in the world oil market , " he told Iran News . " If OPEC saturates the market with its surplus , oil prices would fall sharply . And therefore we expect all non - OPEC members to recognise this fact and also realise that OPEC members will not continue their sacrifice indefinitely . " The minister said U . S . sanctions targeted against Iran ' s oil industry had been unsuccessful with Tehran being able to find markets for oil previously lifted by American firms and that Iran was manufacturing equipment . " Iran has many long - term agreements with foreign companies and therefore we have been very successful in our endeavours , " Aghazadeh said . " With the diligent activities of Iran ' s various industries we have tried to manufacture our own parts domestically . And in line with this policy we have saved $ 200 million in the past two years . " U . S . President Bill Clinton imposed a unilateral but sweeping trade and investment ban against Iran in 1995 for Iran ' s alleged sponsorship of international terrorism and its nuclear weapons programme . Iran denies the charges .

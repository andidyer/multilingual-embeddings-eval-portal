Vietnam ' s corporate star Huy Hoang denies problems . Vietnam ' s Huy Hoang company , a shining example of the communist country ' s switch to market economics , denied on Friday that it had followed other prominent conglomerates to the brink of bankruptcy . " At present we have no problems with cash , " said Nguyen Duc Lam , secretary to the company chairman . " People are creating lots of bad rumours to pull Huy Hoang down . " He was explaining a report in the official daily Vietnam News that quoted Chairman Le Van Kiem as saying the company had not invested heavily in the crisis - torn property market . Doubts about the textiles - to - infrastructure company had been raised by its decision to go into partnership with state - owned companies . However , Lam said that Ho Chi Minh City - based Huy Hoang was not looking to bolster its capital by taking state - owned firms into his shareholding structure . Instead , it was in talks with four state companies to set up a new joint venture , in which it would hold a 70 - percent share . Kiem said the new organisation would combine the best of private and state - run enterprise , creating what the ruling Communist Party terms a " state capitalist company " . " By blending the dynamism and effectiveness of the private sector with the state ' s tight management , the state capitalist company will become very productive , " he said . Kiem , a former Communist Party member , founded Huy Hoang in 1990 with initial capital of $ 1 million . The company thrived in the country ' s reform - led boom - - as did Kiem , who flaunted his personal wealth with diamond - encrusted watches and a fleet of Mercedes and Rolls Royce cars . News of his plans to link up with state - owned firms came amid a flurry of bad news about other prominent companies that had embarked on headlong investment drives and then run into trouble . The heads of the private - sector companies Minh Phung and Epco were arrested in March for alleged fraud linked to loans for investment in the property market , which has gone from boom to bust . Thirteen more Minh Phung executives were arrested last week .

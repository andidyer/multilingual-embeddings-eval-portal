Sentencing is set for Dec . 5 and May and Love could each receive a maximum of 364 days in jail . Their four children have been taken into state custody and the twins have already been adopted by another family . The two deputies , posing as a man and wife unable to have children of their own , paid May $ 2 , 000 as a down payment then arrested the couple . Love and May had even brought two older children along so that the buyers could have some idea of what the twins might look like when they got older , witnesses testified .

VIAG sees above average results ahead . German diversified utility VIAG AG said on Friday it expected above - average results in the next few years . " I think that with our specific combination of companies we can reach an above average performance for our shareholders , " said VIAG chief Georg Obermaier . Going into 1997 , he added , VIAG is " stronger than ever " because of the solid basis provided by the consistently high results of its energy business . VIAG should save more than 500 million marks in expenses through cost - cutting at VIAG ' s Bayernwerk AG energy unit , he said . Bayernwerke secured a majority stake in power producer Isar - Amperwerke AG last year . Bayernwerk also planned to expand its presence in central Europe , where it already has partnerships in Austria , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Switzerland . VIAG ' s chemicals and packaging units also had high potential but operate in cyclical businesses , he said . A majority stake in specialty chemicals maker SKW Trostberg AG would help boost chemicals revenue , while packaging should achieve world - class growth and yields . The logistics and telecommunications groups were also headed to fast growth , while the trading sector would be positive , Obermaier said . In telecommunications , VIAG would offer a full slate of phone services in 1998 , he said . - - Bonn Newsroom , + 49 - 228 26097150

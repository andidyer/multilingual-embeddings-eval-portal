Two killed , up to 30 trapped in Bangkok blaze . Two construction workers died on Sunday when they jumped off a blazing 36 - storey building in central Bangkok and up to 30 were trapped on the top floor , Thai police said . Police helicopters airlifted at least 40 people to safety and more were being pulled from the building where thick smoke billowed , witnesses said . Another dozen workers used ropes to climb down from the middle of the smoke - filled building whose construction was nearly complete , they added . National Police Chief Pracha Promnok , who was at the scene to direct operations , told Reuters that thick smoke and heat from the blaze , which broke out on the six or seventh floor , was hampering rescue operations . " Another 30 workers are trapped on the top floor of the building . Our police helicopters are conducting rescue operations , " he said . " Strong winds and heat and thick smoke from the building are making the rescue job difficult , " he added . But he said efforts would continue to rescue all the trapped workers . One of the police helicopters used in the rescue had to be withdrawn after one of its propellers broke . Police said the helicopter had made an emergency landing in a field nearby and all four aboard were safe . Witnesses saw step - ladders and safety braces being dropped to people waiting to be rescued on the top floor from helicopters which hovered just above the building . Each helicopter was airlifting one person at a time . Another 15 workers were injured in the fire , which broke out late in the morning in the building next to a hotel . More than 30 fire engines and hundreds of rescue workers and police were at the scene . Pracha said the cause of the fire was still not known , but it occurred as workers were laying carpets on the six or seventh floor of the building .

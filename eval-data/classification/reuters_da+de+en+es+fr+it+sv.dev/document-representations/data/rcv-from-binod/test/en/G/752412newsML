Dutch soldier injured , truck hit in Serb attacks . A Dutch peacekeeping soldier was wounded in a hand grenade attack on Bosnian Serb - controlled territory in the latest retaliation for a Western crackdown on indicted war criminals , NATO said on Thursday . The soldier was hit in the groin by shrapnel and flown to a Dutch military hospital in Novi Travnik , where doctors reported he was in stable condition , NATO spokesman Major John Blakeley said . The soldiers were attacked on Wednesday evening after their armoured vehicle turned on its side on a muddy road in Kotor Varos , southeast of Banja Luka in the country ' s Serb Republic . As the Dutch were trying to tow the vehicle with another armoured vehicle , two drunken men came out of a nearby house and threw a grenade at them , Blakeley said . The grenade detonated at " fairly close range " to the soldiers , he added . Dutch soldiers fired one shot and captured one of the men . The second was later detained by local Serb police . Blakeley said the incident could not be considered an organised attack because the two men were " obviously drunk " . A wave of apparent revenge attacks against the multinational peace force and international agencies have followed a NATO raid this month on suspected war criminals . A U . S . soldier was slightly injured by flying glass in an explosion last week in Doboj . Early on Thursday , a U . N . pick - up truck was destroyed by rocket - propelled grenades in the eastern town of Bratunac . " Two explosions in Bratunac resulted in the demolition of a U . N . vehicle , " U . N . spokesman Alex Ivanko told Reuters , adding that no one had been injured . U . N . officials said one unexploded grenade had been found at the scene , he said . The pick - up truck was parked outside the apartment of an international police monitor . A Western official who asked not to be named said the monitor was a U . S . citizen . Since NATO pounced on two Serbs indicted for war crimes two weeks ago , hardline Serb nationalists have launched a low - level revenge campaign to protest against the alliance raid . Small - scale explosions have damaged vehicles and apartments of monitors working for the international police and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which is supervising local elections in Bosnia . No one has been killed in the attacks . The U . N . Security Council on Wednesday strongly condemned the retaliation and called on Serb authorities to bring culprits to justice . A German newspaper reported on Wednesday that Germany , Britain and the United States were concerned about the safety of top government officials . It named Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German officials as being at risk . Western officials say the campaign has been orchestrated by Serb hardliners loyal to wartime leader Radovan Karadzic who feel threatened by the tougher NATO policy towards war crimes suspects . The attacks appear designed to discourage NATO from launching more arrest operations against suspects , including Karadzic , who have been indicted by the U . N . war crimes tribunal in The Hague . British soldiers seized and extradited one suspect and shot dead another who resisted arrest in the Prijedor region two weeks ago .

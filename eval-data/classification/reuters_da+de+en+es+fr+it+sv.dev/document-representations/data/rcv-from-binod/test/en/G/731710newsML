RUGBY UNION - Bok coach ' s selection comes under fire . PRETORIA , July 16 - Carel du Plessis ' s Springbok selection has come under severe criticism from all corners of South Africa as the team prepares in private for Sunday ' s ( NZ time ) Tri - Series rugby test against the All Blacks , NZPA reports . The South African coach called it over - reacting , but there were ominous signs that the campaign to axe him from the job would intensify significantly if the Boks lost the year ' s opening match of the series at Ellis Park . The strongest criticism was directed at the non - inclusion of winger James Small and first five - eighth Henry Honiball in the starting 15 . The Pretoria News newspaper reacted to du Plessis ' selection with shock . Under the headlines " Carel kind to the All Blacks " and " Bok side without Small and Honiball takes hospitality a bit far " , the city ' s main daily said : " No Henry Honiball , no James Small , no Adrian Garvey . That was the triple selection bombshell dropped by Springboks coach . . . " And the biggest - - and most inexplicable - - shock , tighthead prop Marius Hurter comes from nowhere to leapfrog Adrian Garvey ' s claims and oust incumbent Dawie Theron . " All Black loose head prop Craig Dowd will have certainly enjoyed his dinner last night with the news that Hurter will once again be his fodder . One of the more painful sights during the All Black series ( last year ) was Hurter retreating before the Aucklander . " The Citizen headed its selection story : " Bok scrum gamble with Hurter " and said : " To confront and hopefully counter the impressive All Black scrum the Springboks last night decided to gamble . " Du Plessis ' selection was widely criticised by former Springboks like Naas Botha on radio talkbacks . There were suggestions he had already lost the test before he even started it . " It ' s just over - reaction , " Du Plessis responded . " Maybe they should wait until the game is over before pulling out their knives . They ' re just pre - judging some of these players , which is grossly unfair . " I can stand criticism , it ' s part of the game everywhere but some people are just waffling on without stopping to think about the type of game we want to play and the type of combination we should have to play that game . " Du Plessis said Hurter ' s selection may shock a lot of South African fans but he was a player capable of holding steady the All Black pack . " Some people tend to forget where the game starts from . If we don ' t have a sound foundation in the front the rest will just fall apart . " The Springboks trained privately today at Ellis Park , the match venue , while the All Blacks had a light sprint session following two days of physical workout . Both teams will round off their training tomorrow .

Embattled Berisha tours Albania to quell unrest . Albanian President Sali Berisha , under fire from investors whose life savings vanished when a row of dubious pyramid schemes collapsed , on Wednesday stepped up a cross - country campaign to win back popular support . Berisha ' s office said he would travel to the central town of Elbasan later in the day to explain his government ' s handling of the crisis that has engulfed Europe ' s poorest nation , after the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes sparked weeks of mass protest . On Tuesday , Berisha went to the southern town of Lushnje , where he told a crowd of cheering party faithful that residents of the region would be exempt from paying taxes for two years to help them recover from financial ruin . Berisha vowed he would also go to the southern port of Vlore , which last week was the scene of some of the worst violence the country has seen since the fall of its hardline communist regime in 1990 . Tens of thousands of investors lost large sums of money in the failed get - rich - quick schemes . They blame Berisha ' s ruling Democratic Party for failing to rein in the funds and for not warning Albanians , who are new to the pitfalls of capitalism , of the risks . Eyewitnesses said some 1 , 500 protesters marched through Vlore in the 15th successive street demonstration against the right - wing government . Students and intellectuals in the town have demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi ' s cabinet and threatened to go on hunger strike on Thursday unless their demands are met . Facing the biggest crisis in his five - year rule , Berisha has started to go on the offensive , admitting he had made mistakes over the past years but calling on investors to take their share of the blame for gambling on the high - risk schemes . " I came to you to admit errors and mistakes by the ruling goverment , the party and by me . But I can tell you the people are also to blame , " he said in Lushnje , mirroring similar remarks in a speech to supporters in Tirana last week . He has steadfastly said that the government would not pay compensation for an estimated $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion lost in five collapsed pyramid schemes in January . But in Lushnje he trotted out a string of promises to try to woo support , from declaring the region a free trade zone to speeding privatisation of telecommunications , industry and petrol . His most striking promise was to remove all taxes for two years for residents in the area . Democratic Party secretary - general Besnik Gjongecaj said he was convinced Berisha ' s carefully scripted strategy would succeed in restoring confidence in the embattled government by helping destitute investors get back on their feet . " The government is working to solve the problems of these people . They have to be quiet and accept the solutions , " he told Reuters Television in an interview . The next test of Berisha ' s popularity may come on Thursday when Albanians commemorate the toppling of the statue of Enver Hoxha , the country ' s stalinist dictator for 40 years . The ruling Democratic Party has called a rally in Tirana but opposition groups have also called on their supporters to demonstrate on the same day in several towns across the nation .

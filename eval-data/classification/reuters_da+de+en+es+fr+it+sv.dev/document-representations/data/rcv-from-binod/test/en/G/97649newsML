Japan refuses to recognise lighthouse in isle row . Japan , seeking to ease tensions with China and Taiwan over disputed East China Sea islands , said on Friday it would not recognise a lighthouse built on one of the islands by a right - wing group . But Tokyo said the decision to deny recognition of the structure built by the Japan Youth Federation did not alter Japan ' s claim of sovereignty to the uninhabited islands , known as the Senkakus in Japanese and as the Diaoyus in Chinese . Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda announced the decision at a news conference , citing a concern for international relations , as Taiwanese negotiators were holding talks in Tokyo with Japanese officials over issues relating to the islands . The Japan Youth Federation , a Tokyo - based rightist group , inflamed a long - dormant sovereignty dispute over the islands in July when it erected the makeshift lighthouse there . The move sparked anti - Japanese protests in Hong Kong , China , Taiwan and Macau . " We made the decision in light of the overall situation including international relations , " Ikeda said . " The decision does not affect Japan ' s ownership of the Senkaku Islands , " he added . Chinese Premier Li Peng said this week the Japanese rightists had undermined Sino - Japanese relations by building and repairing the lighthouse . The right - wing group had applied to Japan ' s Maritime Safety Agency in September for formal recognition of the aluminium lighthouse as a legitimate one . The rightists have argued that they built the lighthouse to help ensure the safety of ships sailing in the East China Sea . Officials from the right - wing group were not immediately available to comment on Tokyo ' s decision . China and Taiwan , which separately challenge Japan ' s claim to the islands , have condemned the construction of the lighthouse and demanded its immediate removal . Tensions grew in the last two months when Japanese patrol boats repelled private Taiwanese boats attempting to take protesters , fishermen and journalists to the islands , triggering calls for a more forceful response from Beijing and Taipei . The dispute escalated on September 26 with the death of a Hong Kong activist , David Chan , who drowned after jumping off a protest ship near the islands , with Tokyo coming under growing pressure to defuse the row . Tokyo ' s claim dates to 1895 , when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories . China has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries . Japan says that as far as it is concerned the issue is not open for discussion . The Taiwan government also claims ownership of the islands , saying they are under the jurisdiction of the northeastern Taiwanese county of Ilan . In Tokyo on Friday , Taiwanese negotiators held talks with Japanese counterparts over fishing rights and other issues stemming from the sovereignty row over the islands . The outcome of the talks was expected to be announced later on Friday . Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan , which recognises only Beijing ' s communist government . Japan was given control of the islands in 1972 by the United States , which had administered the islands along with Okinawa since the end of World War Two . But the U . S . government at the time said any outstanding territorial issue should be settled among the countries concerned .

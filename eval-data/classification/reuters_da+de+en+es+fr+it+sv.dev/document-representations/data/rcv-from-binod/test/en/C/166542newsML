Levent - Taksim subway link and will accept new bids by 0800 GMT on November 7 , the municipality ' s press office said on Tuesday . It said the first tender which consisted of five separate parts and was awarded to a consortium led by Turk Siemens for $ 224 million in October 1995 , was recently cancelled . " The tender ( awarded to Turk Siemens ) was cancelled because the consortium did not sign a detailed technical contract in time although the municipality gave them an extension . Their $ 8 . 5 million guarantee was cashed in , " a city spokeswoman said . Alongside Turk Siemens , owned largely by German Siemens AG , Simko , another Siemens joint - venture in Istanbul and state - owned railway car maker Tuvasas were in the consortium which won the first tender last year . But a spokeswoman for the Turk Siemens consortium denied this accusation , saying the city demanded new terms in August . " The ( first ) tender consisted of five separate packages . We prepared the project accordingly for 11 months , but the municipality put forward a turn - key condition although the tender initially had widely different attributes , " she told Reuters , asking not to be named . " We nevertheless tried to comply with the new condition , but the city cancelled the contract . We are not invited to the new tender . We were subject to unjust practices and for this reason we will seek our rights through legal channels , " she said . Istanbul city has joined the previous five - package contract into one in the new tender , covering power supply , electro - mechanics , track laying , traction , signalling , telecommunication and storage facilities and station fitting . Companies invited to bid in the second tender were named as Swedish - German - Swiss venture ABB Traction AB , French Cegelec and GEC Alsthom , Canadian Bombadier Inc . transportation systems division , and Nissho Iwai Corporation and Mistsubishi Corp from Japan .

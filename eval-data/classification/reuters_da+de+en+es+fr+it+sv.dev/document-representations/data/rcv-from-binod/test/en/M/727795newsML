Portugal ' s IGCP shows it wants lower auction rates . Portugal ' s Institute for Public Credit Management ' s rejection of bids at its six - month bill auction on Monday sent a clear signal that it was looking for lower rates at a 45 billion escudo bond sale later in the day , dealers said . They said the bids at the six - month sale were clearly not seen as aggressive enough after the Bank of Portugal cut its money market rates 30 basis points on Friday . " The Credit Institute wants to give a clear signal that it expects lower rates today on the bonds , " said one dealer . The Institute will be offering 15 billion escudos each of three , five and 10 year bonds with results due around 1000 GMT . - - Fernanda Pargana , Lisbon bureau 3511 - 3113126

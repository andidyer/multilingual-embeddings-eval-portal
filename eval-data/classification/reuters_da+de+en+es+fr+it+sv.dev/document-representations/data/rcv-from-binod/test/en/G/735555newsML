Explosions reported at British base in Bosnia . Four explosive devices were lobbed into the car park of a British base in the Bosnian Serb - controlled town of Banja Luka overnight , Western officials said on Thursday . British peacekeeping soldiers fired warning shots and detained several suspects after the incident , said the officials , who asked not to be named . Initial reports indicated no one was seriously injured and that the devices were probably hand grenades . A NATO officer in Sarajevo confirmed that the small British base in northwestern Banja Luka reported several small explosions caused by three to four " intruders " . He said more details would be available later in the day . The attack marked the fourth explosion in four days in apparent retaliation for a NATO swoop last week on two Serbs indicted for war crimes . Previous blasts targeted international monitors with the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe . None of the bombings have caused injuries . British special forces arrested one war crimes suspect and shot dead another who resisted arrest last Thursday in Prijedor , near Banja Luka . Both men were wanted by the U . N . war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands . A U . S . soldier suffered minor injuries on Wednesday when a man cut him with a hand - sickle in northeast Bosnia . The incident was still under investigation and NATO said it was unclear if the attack was connected to the bombings .

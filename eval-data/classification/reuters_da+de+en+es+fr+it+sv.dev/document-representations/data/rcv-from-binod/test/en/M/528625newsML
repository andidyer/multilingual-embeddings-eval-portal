Dutch closing share market report . Dutch shares shuffled higher on Tuesday , ending slightly off opening peaks , with few major underperformers except music and film group Polygram . The AEX index of leading shares closed up 3 . 77 points , or 0 . 51 percent , at 748 . 69 points . " There ' s hardly been anything of interest in the market . It suggests the underlying market is quite strong , although it has been quiet , " one trader said . Among the leading shares , Polygram ended the weakest , falling 1 . 40 guilders to 94 . 50 . Polygram reported first quarter 1997 net profit down by 1 . 6 percent to 122 million guilders , at the bottom of analysts expectations , as its film business made operating losses . However , the shares which were weak all day actually staged a modest recovery after the release of the figures , surprising some traders . " The profits were at the downside of expectations . We had seen some short selling in the last couple of days . The next quarter is looking a bit healthier , " one trader said . A brighter note was tank storage and shipping group Pakhoed whose shares ended up 3 . 20 guilders at 62 . 70 . The company announced at the very end of trading that its net profit had shown strong growth in the first quarter compared with a year ago . Unilever was up an impressive 8 . 10 guilders at 373 . 30 . The gains were partly to maintain parity with the shares in New York which resulted from increased speculation about the likely buyer of Unilever ' s speciality chemicals business . " Parity ( with New York ) would have meant 369 ( guilders ) , but we ' ve gone past that , " one trader said . Royal Dutch meanwhile strengthened after its U . S . affiliate Shell Oil posted seven percent higher first quarter net income . Royal Dutch shares ended up 4 . 00 guilders at 342 . 40 . Apart from Polygram , the only other area of major weakness was the high technology sector which fell in line with U . S . losses . ASM Lithography dropped 9 . 60 guilders to 139 . 00 , while Baan ended down 1 . 70 guilders at 90 . 30 . " The sector has certainly taken a bit of a hit today , " one trader said . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

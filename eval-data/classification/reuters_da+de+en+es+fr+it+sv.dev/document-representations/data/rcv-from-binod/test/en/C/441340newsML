IOT eye Thai bunker market after opening terminal . Thailand ' s private oil trading firm , International Oil Tanking Pte Ltd ( IOT ) plans to enter the bunker fuel business there after it opens a product storage terminal early next month , a company source said on Thursday . " We are going to start bunker trading in Thailand , " the source said . But he was unable to comment on when the company would begin operations but said it would be " soon " . " We are studying ( whether ) to buy or time charter bunker barges from owners , " he said . IOT plans to initial use three or four bunker barges when it starts the operations , he said . Currently the relatively small Thai bunker market is dominated by the oil majors there . The Thai bunker sale average 100 , 000 - tonnes per month compared with the 1 . 5 million tonnes average chalked up in Singapore . IOT ' s aim of setting up a viable bunker business will be boosted by the startup of its 400 , 000 - tonne storage terminal at Phet Buri about 200 km ( 160 miles ) southwest of Bangkok early next month . The terminal will allow IOT to break bulk easily as about half the terminal ' s capacity has been earmarked for fuel oil and crude oil storage . The source said the crude oil will be stored there on behalf of some Thai refiners . " We are negotiating with some refinery to store crude oil , " he said . Crude oil will be shipped from the terminal to the refinery in smaller tankers , he said . IOT will use the other half of the terminal to store gas oil and gasoline for retail sale in Indochina through its sister company Cosmo Oil . Cosmo Oil , no relation to its Japanese namesake , has its own barges , eight oil depots and 230 service stations in Thailand , as well as a number of service stations in Laos and Burma . The company is now looking to expand into Cambodia , Vietnam and southern China . The source said IOT will expand the terminal capacity by 300 , 000 tonnes within the next two years . IOT is also involved in an ongoing programme to rejuvenate its 17 - vessel tanker fleet that includes one ultra large crude carrier ( ULCC ) , two very large crude carriers ( VLCC ) and four long - range tankers . - - Singapore Newsroom ( + 65 - 870 3093 )

Slovak bourse ' s downtrend shows no signs of ending . The Bratislava Stock Exchange ' s ( BSE ) downtrend continued on Friday , with a slide in major shares pushing the SAX index down 0 . 15 points to a year - low of 170 . 70 . Only 236 shares were traded on the BSE listed floor , with steel maker VSZ , usually the most liquid issue , matching only 17 shares as it closed down four crowns at 621 . Other blue chips such as bank VUB and oil refinery Slovnaft , either did not trade , or eased on insignificant volumes . Brokers said they saw little evidence that the current lack of liquidity would change in the near future due to a lack of investor interest and the usual summer slowdown . Overall , volume increased to 696 , 634 shares , from 277 , 632 shares traded on Thursday , while turnover jumped to 440 . 57 million crowns , from 73 . 77 million . Both volume and turnover were boosted by some heavy direct deals and portfolio transactions , dealers said .

BOXING - TYSON ALREADY TRAINING FOR HOLYFIELD REMATCH IN MAY . The word from the Mike Tyson empire is that the former scourge of the heavyweight division already has begun training for a rematch against Evander Holyfield , scheduled for May 3 . That means Tyson will train for some 16 weeks - - about eight weeks longer than is usual for many fighters and certainly longer than the four weeks he took for the first fight - - to get ready for a bid to reclaim his crown . Holyfield grabbed the World Boxing Association title while giving Tyson a boxing lesson and a thorough beating before stopping him at 37 seconds of the 11th round November 9 . Tyson may get himself into top physical shape to fight the always prepared Holyfield . But it is the cerebral part of his game that many people ( including , it seems , his own cadre of confidants ) think needs to be shaped up . In light of that , the rumour from inside and outside the Tyson camp seems credible that he may rehire veteran trainer Richie Giachetti to prepare him for Holyfield in what will be the biggest money fight in history with a gross of well over a $ 100 million . Sources close to the promotion for the fight say Holyfield , who comes to the negotiating table with the World Boxing Association title , will get about $ 35 million and Tyson $ 15 million . Giachetti , Larry Holmes ' s long - time trainer , worked with Tyson for his fifth - round stoppage of Briton Frank Bruno in 1989 , after Tyson had fired long - time trainer Kevin Rooney . Rooney , who won a breach of contract suit against Tyson , was dumped for what Tyson thought were uncomplimentary remarks about his then wife , actress Robin Givens . But Tyson jettisoned Giachetti , and apparently thinking he really didn ' t need all that much help to wade through the tattered ranks of heavyweights , hired long - time friend Jay Bright , who had limited experience as a trainer , and added other relatively inexperienced cornermen . Those moves made it obvious that Tyson and Co . valued blind loyalty more than experience in the ring . To be fair to Bright , he was handicapped by not having complete control of Tyson ' s training as most trainers have of their fighters . The Tyson camp ' s penchant for secrecy , which seems to run closer to pathology than to strategy , is evident by the refusal of those close to Tyson to go on the record even to confirm that their man has begun training in Ohio . Further confirming the Tyson crew ' s galloping paranoia of the press is the muzzling of Bright , who could give Mother Teresa lessons in devotion . It seems that Bright , while he might not be thrown overboard , will be shunted aside to the role of cheerleader as Tyson prepares for Holyfield . Bright and the rest of the Tyson corner came under intense criticism following some amateurish lapses in Tyson ' s first professional loss to James " Buster " Douglas in Tokyo in 1990 . The loss to Holyfield brought back more challenges to the competence of the Tyson corner , which also includes Stacey McKinley and Dave Jacobs . Holyfield ' s trainer , Don Turner - - never a stranger to self promotion - - echoed the wide - spread criticism of Tyson ' s corner for the Holyfield fight . " It was amateur night in his corner between rounds , " Turner said in the current issue of KO boxing magazine . " His cut man was on the wrong side and had to reach all the way across Tyson ' s body to work on the cut . " Tyson just doesn ' t have a corner , he doesn ' t have anybody to teach him . All he ' s got is clowns around him , " Turner said . Some people who were close to Tyson ' s corner in the Holyfield fight said that as Holyfield was hammering their man they offered him such words of wisdom as , " you ' re doing great champ . Try not to get hit so much . " And after the 10th round when it seemed Tyson was close to being knocked out and many thought it would be sheer masochism to come out for the 11th round , his men told him with a firm grasp of the obvious rivaling Noah ' s observation that it was raining out , " Mike , you gotta win the next two rounds . " Holyfield promptly rained nearly a dozen unanswered punches on Tyson ' s head and the referee stopped the slaughter . After the fight , Tyson said he didn ' t remember anything past the third round . The argument could be made that his corner ' s attention deficit disorder kicked in well before then .

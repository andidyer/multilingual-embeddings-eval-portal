Volume 337 . 61 million , value A $ 842 . 72 million , 1 , 117 stocks traded , 293 steady , 531 up , 293 down . The Australian share market streaked to a record close on Wednesday as enthusiastic investors bid the blue chips higher in a broad - based rally . The key market barometer , the All Ordinaries index , leapt 24 . 7 points to 2 , 745 . 9 . Earlier , it had touched a record high of 2 , 751 . 4 surpassing the previous record high of 2 , 728 . 5 reached on June 30 . The September share price index futures contract was 16 points higher at 2 , 776 , a 30 . 1 point premium to the underlying index . " This market must be steroids , " said a dealer at a Melbourne - based investment house , amazed at the local bourse ' s seemingly unstoppable recent run . Since the 1997 low of 2 , 341 . 1 on April 3 , the benchmark All Ordinaries index has rocketed 410 . 3 points or 17 . 5 percent to today ' s record high . While it seemed like only yesterday traders were marvelling at the market ' s resilience in convincingly capturing the territory above 2 , 600 , the march to today ' s rarefied levels around 2 , 750 left brokers pleased but slightly bewildered as to the driving factors in the latest uptick of the bull rally . " I think the data backed up what most people thought - that there was a still a possibility ( of a cut ) , probably not in the near future but maybe in the medium term , " one dealer said . Underlining this view was continued strong support for the big banks which helped blaze the trail to higher ground . Leader of the pack , National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank touched record highs of A $ 19 . 60 and A $ 16 . 15 respectively before easing to close at A $ 19 . 39 and A $ 16 . 01 . Among the others , Westpac Banking Corporation jumped 0 . 8 percent to A $ 7 . 97 , while ANZ Bank added five cents or 0 . 5 percent to A $ 9 . 93 . Others to impress included telecoms / healthcare group Mayne Nickless after news that Cable & Wireless Plc had doubled its stake in Optus Communications Pty Ltd to 49 percent . Mayne , a 24 . 9 percent Optus shareholder , welcomed the deal , saying it reduced its underwriting exposure to the rollout of local telephony services . Mayne shares closed over four percent higher at A $ 8 . 05 . Among the resources , bellwether BHP was keenly sought , adding 1 . 6 percent to A $ 19 . 83 , while Rio Tinto streaked ahead , putting on 2 . 2 percent to A $ 22 . 97 after big gains in London trade . Among second line stocks , software group Computershare Ltd leapt A $ 2 . 55 or about 27 percent to A $ 12 . 00 , albeit in thin trade , as investors digested Tuesday ' s deal that sees The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc emerge with a 9 . 09 percent stake in Computershare . Computershare said the deal gives the group a foothold in the U . K . market . Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about nine to five , while about 26 percent of stocks traded remained steady . Derivatives trade saw only moderate activity with 39 , 331 options and 5 , 815 September SPI futures contracts traded . In other local markets , Australian bonds ended in negative territory for the first time in a week after there was no rate cut announcement forthcoming from the RBA in the morning and data suggested the economy was starting to gather steam . By 5 . 00 p . m . ( 0700 GMT ) , 10 year T - bonds were yielding 7 . 02 percent , compared to Tuesday ' s 6 . 97 percent . The Australian dollar made gains on the day , creeping higher through the afternoon as a firm set of domestic data was seen as slightly reducing the chances of another official rate cut . By 5 . 00 p . m . ( 0700 GMT ) , the unit had staged a rally to US $ 0 . 7549 / 54 from US $ 0 . 7525 / 30 late here Tuesday . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( TECHNICALS ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Short - term range Support Restnce RSI - 14 MA - 10 MA - 20AORD 2700 / 2750 2710 2750 78 . 01 2710 2674SPI 2750 / 2800 2740 2790 77 . 71 2738 2701 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - KEY ACTIVES - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * Mayne A $ 8 . 05 ( + . 33 ) 7 . 766 / 8 . 06 Vol : 5 , 372 , 713Cable & Wireless deal boosts 24 . 9 percent Optus shareholder . * NAB A $ 19 . 39 ( + . 371 ) 19 . 038 / 19 . 60 Vol : 2 , 937 , 816 * CommBank A $ 16 . 01 ( + . 17 ) 15 . 86 / 16 . 15 Vol : 1 , 028 , 733 * ANZ Bank A $ 9 . 91 9 + . 05 ) 9 . 852 / 9 . 96 Vol : 2 , 079 , 773 * Westpac A $ 7 . 97 ( + . 06 ) 7 . 93 / 8 . 05 Vol : 3 , 927 , 691Bank sector buoyant as buyers chase yield . * Rio Tinto A $ 22 . 97 ( + . 50 ) 22 . 551 / 23 . 15 Vol : 1 , 213 , 956Strong performance in London trade boosts giant mining group . * BHP A $ 19 . 83 ( + . 31 ) 19 . 541 / 19 . 85 Vol : 3 , 603 , 656 Bellwether shares in widespread buying interest . * WMC A $ 8 . 37 ( + . 01 ) 8 . 35 / 8 . 45 Vol : 2 , 609 , 544 Gold / nickel miner scoots higher early but hits profit - takers . * Computershare A $ 12 . 00 ( + 2 . 55 ) 9 . 508 / 12 . 25 Vol : 126 , 088 Software syatems group soars after deal with Scottish bank . - - Walter Watson , Sydney Newsroom , 61 - 2 9373 - 1810

Four regional Bells choose Alcatel ADSL modems . Alacatel Telecom , part of France ' s Alcatel Alsthom Cie Generale d ' Electricite , said Monday it has been chosen to supply high - speed modems to four regional Bells . A source close to the deal said the order for asymetric digital subscriber link modems by Ameritech Corp . , BellSouth Corp . , Pacific Telesis Group and SBC Communications Corp . is worth $ 300 million . No spokesmen at the companies were immediately available to confirm the figures . The modems allow existing copper telephone cables to support broadband services like interactive television , and allow Internet access at speeds 50 or more times higher than conventional 28 . 8 kilobits per second analogue modems . The news was a blow to Westell Technologies Inc . , which trade press reports said had been expected to share in the order . Westell ' s stock tumbled $ 10 . 50 to $ 35 . 875 on Nasdaq , where it was among the most active issues at midday . No details on the number of modems or their cost was given , and Alcatel said contract negotiations have yet to be finalised . Each of the four companies has its own separate trials and deployment schedule for the modems , Alcatel said in a statement . They expect to serve thousands of customers in the next 18 months , rising to about one million by 2001 . Negotiations are expected to be finalised within two weeks .

Raines believes CBO estimates pessimistic . White House budget director Franklin Raines said Tuesday the Congressional Budget Office is still taking too pessimistic a view on the performance of the U . S . economy . " Although CBO ' s assumptions are within the range of mainstream views , we believe they will continue to prove pessimistic , " Raines said in a written statement . The CBO Monday lowered by one - third its forecast for the budget deficit but warned that red ink would run near $ 200 billion by 2002 if the White House and Congress took no action . The non - partisan budget analysis arm of Congress said this year ' s federal deficit is predicted to reach $ 124 billion , far less than the $ 171 billion it projected a year ago . It also forecast continued moderate growth and low inflation . Raines , director of the Office of Management and Budget , said the Clinton administration was pleased that the CBO had moved closer to the administration ' s views about the direction of the economy and the size of the deficit . " For the last four years , both OMB ' s and CBO ' s projections have proved too conservative , " he said . " The economy has performed better than either projected , while the deficit has fallen much faster . OMB ' s projections , however , have been a bit closer to the mark . As we look ahead , we expect that to continue . CBO expects taxable incomes in the economy to fall substantially , even though profits have grown rapidly in recent years . They also expect unemployment to rise to six percent . It has remained well below that the last two years , " Raines said .

India ' s RBI seen aiding exporters , but not enough . Indian exporters , stung by a stubbornly strong rupee , may get some relief if the central bank lowers interest on export credit next week , bankers and exporters said on Thursday . But any move by the Reserve Bank of India in its half - yearly credit policy statement on Tuesday is unlikely to revive export growth as long as the exchange rate handicaps India ' s competitiveness , they said . The rupee has held around 35 . 80 / 90 per dollar since mid - 1996 despite an annual inflation rate of more than 6 . 0 percent and appreciation of the dollar against major global currencies . " Nothing has been done for exporters for some time , " said Ranjit Shah , director at diamond export firm Suraj Diamonds Ltd , adding that the rupee had hurt trade . Shah said Indian banks had lowered their prime lending rate for domestic borrowers after the October 1996 monetary policy , but there was no reduction in interest on export credit . The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has fixed interest on post - shipment export credit at 13 . 0 percent for up to 90 days and 15 . 0 percent for 91 - 180 days . The lowest prime lending rate charged by Indian banks is 14 . 5 percent but most borrowers have to pay between 16 percent and 18 percent . A top official of Arvind Mills , India ' s leading exporter of denim fabrics , said the steady rupee - dollar exchange rate was the main cause for a slowdown in export growth . " It is affecting Indian exports more than anything else , " Jayesh Shah , group vice president ( finance ) at Arvind Mills said . India exports mostly price - sensitive commodities , and its neighbours have been devaluing their currencies chipping away at the country ' s competitiveness , bankers said . The Indian rupee has tended to appreciate against the dollar on the back of large inflows of capital in recent months , and the RBI has been buying dollars to arrest the rupee ' s rise . Arvind Mills ' Shah said a cut in interest on export credit would make exports more profitable , but he was not certain it would happen . Anil Singhvi , treasurer at Gujarat Ambuja Cements , said he did not think RBI will lower export credit rate . " I doubt any bank will want to lend below 13 . 0 percent . " The government has attributed the slowdown in export growth mainly to a downtrend in global commodity markets . The commerce ministry said on March 31 that India ' s export growth in 1996 / 97 ( April - March ) was lower than expected . " Between April 1996 and January 1997 , merchandise exports totalled $ 27 . 07 billion , up 6 . 19 percent from $ 25 . 49 billion over the same 10 - month period from April 1995 to January 1996 , " a ministry statement said . In fiscal 1995 / 96 , exports were valued at $ 31 . 83 billion , recording a 21 . 38 percent rise over 1994 / 95 , it said .

Cyprus Pepsi deal is off , says company . A deal for the takeover of PepsiCo operations in Cyprus by the local brewers of Carlsberg Beer has fallen through , the company which made the bid said on Wednesday . Photos Photiades Breweries announced the deal was called off because an agreement was not reached with PepsiCo on purchase of the franchise which would allow use of its brand names . In late January Photiades Breweries announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement for the takeover of bottlers Loizos Louca and Sons Ltd . , a private company which has the franchise of Pepsi , Seven - Up Ivi and Lipton Ice Tea on the island . Cypriot weekly newspaper The Cyprus Financial Mirror said the anticipated deal has been called off ' possibly due to the exorbitant financial demands of the global soft drinks giant ' . " Obviously their demands were unrealistic , " brewery managing director Pavlos Photiades told the newspaper , without elaborating . The agreement was conditional to the franchise deal with PepsiCo , the Financial Mirror said . A few days before the deal was announced Loizos Louca rejected a takeover bid by Keo , the largest winery and brewery in Cyprus . - - Michele Kambas , Nicosia newsroom 357 2 365089

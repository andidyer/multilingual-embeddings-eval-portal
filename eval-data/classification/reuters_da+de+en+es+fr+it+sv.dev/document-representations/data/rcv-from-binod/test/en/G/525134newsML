Centre - right would win French election now - poll . France ' s ruling centre - right coalition would lose about 160 seats but retain a parliamentary majority if a general election were held now , an opinion poll published on Monday showed . The SOFRES poll , in the daily newspaper Le Figaro , appeared hours before President Jacques Chirac announced he was dissolving the National Assembly and calling an early parliamentary election for May 25 and June 1 . The survey , conducted last Thursday and Friday , found the Gaullist - dominated coalition would retain 318 of the 478 seats it now holds in the 577 - member Assembly elected in 1993 . It would therefore hold onto a comfortable lower house majority , the poll of 1 , 000 adults found . Some 60 percent of voters said they had already made up their minds who to vote for , while 40 percent said they could still change their minds . The poll indicated the following breakdown in seats if an election were held now : centre - right coalition 318 ; Socialists , ecologists and other non - communist left - wing groups 208 ; Communists 27 and rightist National Front ( FN ) two . France ' s electoral system is such that the FN has no seats in the assembly now despite commanding the votes of up to 15 percent of the electorate . Another poll released on Monday showed support for the governing centre - right coalition rose by one point while the left ' s standing was stable . A coalition of Chirac ' s Gaullist Rally for the Republic and the centrist Union for French Democracy would take 40 percent of the vote , up one percentage point from two weeks earlier , the poll by Louis Harris for Valeurs Actuelle showed . The Socialists would take 26 . 5 percent of the vote , a 0 . 5 percentage point increase , the poll showed . The Communist Party ' s showing fell by one point to nine percent and left - of - centre environmentalists rose 0 . 5 points to 8 . 5 percent in the standings . Two percent would vote for the extreme left party , unchanged from the previous poll . The combined left of centre parties would reach 46 percent of the vote . The sampling of 951 people taken on April 18 and 19 showed that Jean - Marie Le Pen ' s far - right National Front would receive 14 percent of the vote , down one point . Twenty percent of those questioned said they had not decided who to vote for and 31 percent of those expressing a preference said they could still change their mind .

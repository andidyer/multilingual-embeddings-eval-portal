Chechens to vote for independence in postwar poll . Chechens vote on Monday in elections that will reinforce their demands that Russia must grant sovereignty to their mainly Moslem region . Aslan Maskhadov , who led rebel Chechen fighters in a two - year guerrilla war against one of the world ' s biggest military machines , was the clear frontrunner to win the presidential race . But all the main candidates in the 13 - man field committed themselves to turning the de facto autonomy secured by last month ' s withdrawal of Russian troops into full sovereignty after 200 years of deeply unpopular Russian rule . Russia , fearing instability on its volatile southern flank and unrest among other ethnic minorities , flatly opposes secession and a deputy foreign minister said it would sever diplomatic ties with any country recognising Chechnya . Maskhadov said he was determined to win international recognition and seek war reparations from Moscow for the massive destruction wrought by Russian tanks , planes and guns on Chechen towns and factories . Tens of thousands of civilians were killed . Enthusiasm was high for Chechnya ' s first internationally - monitored elections . Posters of the main candidates adorned cars and buildings , mostly showing the region ' s green Moslem flag . Polling stations open at 7 a . m . ( 0400 GMT ) in the region , which is half the size of Belgium or a little larger than Connecticut . It is bounded on three sides by the south Russian plain and backed by the towering Caucasus mountains . Some half a million voters - - about half the pre - war population - - may be eligible . Precise data was not available and up to 60 , 000 refugees outside Chechnya may vote at over a dozen polling stations set up near the borders . Moscow has complained that many refugees , especially ethnic Russians , now live too far away to vote . Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has said he will work with any elected leader . But a string of gripes about the voting have given some observers the feeling that Moscow may be making excuses in advance to question the ballot . President Boris Yeltsin , convalescing after heart surgery and pneumona , has admitted that sending in the army to try to crush Chechnya ' s three - year post - Soviet experiment in unilateral independence was one of his biggest mistakes . He agreed to elections as part of last year ' s peace deal but , as a face - saving measure , insisted on deferring the issue of sovereignty for five years . Maskhadov and the other main contenders now say they will not delay negotiations any longer . More than 100 outside observers , including some Russians , will monitor the elections . Chechen leaders , worried about attacks aimed at disrupting the voting in a region awash with weaponry , have taken extensive security measures . Polls close at 8 p . m . ( 1700 GMT ) and first results are expected late on Monday or early Tuesday . Voters are also choosing among some 850 candidates for 63 local assembly seats . Straw polls last week suggested Maskhadov , a 45 - year - old former Soviet army colonel , could win outright with more than 50 percent of the vote . Many Chechens admire the way he not only won the war but negotiated the peace with Moscow . If he does not reach 50 percent , there will be a run - off in two weeks time . The three other main candidates are Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , who took over after the charismatic champion of secession Dzhokhar Dudayev was killed in April , guerrilla commander Shamil Basayev and rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov . Basayev , 32 , who made his name with a bloody raid on the southern Russian town of Budennovsk in 1995 , has campaigned vigorously for an Islamic republic . A wanted man in Russia , his election would be a nightmare for the Kremlin .

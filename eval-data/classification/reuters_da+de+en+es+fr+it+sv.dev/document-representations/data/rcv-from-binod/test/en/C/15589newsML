Ingram Micro names Jerry Stead chairman . Ingram Micro Inc . , the world ' s largest distributor of microcomputer products , Tuesday named Jerre Stead chairman and chief executive , effective immediately . Stead is the former chairman and chief executive officer of Legent Corp . before its acquisition by Computer Associates International Inc . and of AT & T Corp . ' s Global Information Solutions ( NCR Corp . ) . Stead replaces Lindwood Lacy , who left in May due to " irreconcilable differences " over how the $ 1 . 8 billion company would be run in its final months before a planned spin - off from its parent , Nashville - based Ingram Industries Inc . The company said plans for the spin - off , which will come through a 20 million - share initial public offering of stock , are unchanged . The shares are expected to sell for $ 14 to $ 16 each . Morgan Stanley & Co . Inc . is the lead underwriter . Ingram is awaiting a favourable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on whether the spin - off would be tax - free . Once the IRS ruling is received , plans for the offer will be finalised , the company said . Industry experts believe the initial public offering , which will likely come in September , will be well received and that Stead ' s naming as chief executive should boost expectations for the offering by soothing management concerns . " In the short term , it helps , " said Manish Shah , publisher of IPO Maven , a leading research publication . " but the company will still have to prove itself in the market every day . " Stead , 53 , brings a solid background in the computer and electronic information industries to Ingram Micro . He helped guide Legent ' s $ 1 . 8 billion sale in 1995 to Computer Associates , a top rival in mainframe software development . He also led several of AT & T ' s units . including the $ 8 . 5 billion Global Information Solutions unit and the Global Business Communications Systems group , which he turned into a profitable unit after it was a money loser for years . But some industry experts question whether his skills in leading manufacturing companies will transfer well to Ingram Micro ' s focus on computer distribution and wholesale markets . Under Lacy ' s 11 years of leadership , Ingram Micro grew to one of the world ' s largest distributors of computer products with annual sales of $ 8 . 6 billion and net income of $ 84 . 3 million in 1995 . By contrast , in 1991 the company generated net sales of $ 2 . 0 billion and income of $ 30 . 2 million . With the slowdown in the growth of computer product sales this year , however , some market experts believe investors may initially stay away from Ingram Micro ' s shares until they can judge the health of the company from its Christmas sales .

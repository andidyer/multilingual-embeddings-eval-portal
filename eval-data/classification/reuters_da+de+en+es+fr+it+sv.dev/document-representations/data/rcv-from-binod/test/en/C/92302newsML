Telewest says to carry GSB channels . UK cable operator Telewest Communications Plc said on Tuesday that it would provide its customers with access to the GSB programming package , which is backed by British Sky Broadcasting and Granada . " Telewest . . . is delighted to announce the launch of the GSB programming package on its cable systems throughout the UK , " the company said in a statement . Telewest said it previously refused to carry the package until existing customers had been asked for their views . It said it had asked them if they were keen to receive the package even if it led to an increase in monthly subscriptions . Views on no extra charge being levied were also canvassed . Telewest said that , although research was in its early stages , preliminary results indicated " a significant proportion . . . would like the package if it incurred no extra expense . " " The agreement reached this evening with GSB for carriage terms satisfies that customer requirement . Telewest customers will be provided with access from tonight , " it added . - - Alexander Smith , London Newsroom + + 44 171 542 7719

Physical copper premiums static , but seen easing . Physical copper premiums are holding steady for now , but look set to ease shortly as a high LME backwardation attracts material to a tight market , traders said on Monday . " Premiums haven ' t been easing yet , but they will over the next couple of days , " said one London - based physical trader . " The backwardation bites very hard in the next few days so I would expect more material to be in circulation , " he added . The cash to three months backwardation ballooned to a high of $ 210 last week as technical tightness emerged in late April and early May dates . The backwardation eased slightly in the LME midday trading session to around $ 130 amid a flurry of lending . Three months copper also came off the morning ' s highs above $ 2 , 400 . Physical traders said the European merchant market was subdued , with demand dampened by prohibitively high premiums . Although consumption was good , it was covered by long - term contracts . " The back is killing off any interest as cash above $ 2 , 600 is not conducive to developing any extra business , " a trader said . " It ' s a little bit steep .

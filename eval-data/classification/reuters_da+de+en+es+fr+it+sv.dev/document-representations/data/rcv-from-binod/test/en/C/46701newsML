INTERVIEW - Arch plans new acquisitions . Arch Petroleum Inc plans to make fresh acquisitions of small oil exploration companies within the next 90 days to boost its expansion in Alberta , company President Larry Kalas said . " With the right target , we could significantly add to our asset base up there , add to our cash flow in a meaningful way , realize benefits of consolidation in our staffing and pick up a number of additional , good - quality exploration projects that can help fuel explosive growth , " Kalas told Reuters in an interview this week . Kalas said the Fort Worth - based oil and gas company feels " fairly good " about some of the ongoing Canadian negotiations it is involved in , adding that any takeover deals would be worth about $ 20 million each . In February , Arch bought Trax Petroleums Limited of Calgary , Alberta for a total price of about $ 13 . 7 million . Kalas said exploratory wells on some of the prospects in Trax ' s portfolio have been successful and that Arch ' s net share of those reserves is almost 1 million barrels of oil equivalent . Several other wells will be drilled before the end of the year . " If the reserves estimates stand up under scrutiny , we ' ve doubled the reserves of Trax at this point in time , " Kalas said . He said finding costs on the first prospects being developed in Alberta are at a low $ 2 per barrel . Kalas said the planned acquisitions should not hurt the company ' s bottom line in the short - term because " the companies we are looking at are profitable . . . ( and ) the assets blend in very nicely with the assets of Trax " . A company spokesman said Arch ' s overall performance was probably better than analysts believe , and that it expects to earn " a penny or two per share " this year . While the Canadian projects are seen as providing the strongest impetus for company growth , Kalas said Arch is also looking to boost its oil output in Texas and New Mexico . Its finding costs in Texas are at about $ 3 . 50 a barrel , he said . He said Arch ' s gas pipelines near the U . S . - Mexico border offer a wealth of business opportunities and that the company hopes to win some contracts with Mexico ' s state - owned oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos . " We think we have some quality ideas that the bigger guys might overlook , " he said , adding that Arch hopes to pick up pipeline contracts in the $ 10 million range .

Dollar drops briefly below 123 yen in Tokyo . The dollar slid briefly below 123 yen in late morning trade on Friday , the first time it had fallen to that level in over a month , traders said . The greenback , which has declined for the past four days in part on worries that central banks may be gearing up to sell the U . S . currency to halt its two - year - old rally , took another hit on Thursday when a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said it could drop to 103 yen . It was the first time the dollar , which fell to 123 . 75 yen in late New York trading on Thursday , had dropped below 123 yen since April 4 . A comment by Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara on Thursday afternoon that the yen could rise as far as 103 yen to the dollar jolted the market and undermined the dollar . On Friday , the dollar first weakened when Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said he hoped a currency agreement by the Group of Seven ( G7 ) industrial nations in late April would be " further digested " by the markets . Financial leaders from the G7 - - Japan , the United States , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada - - said after they met in Washington that they would monitor exchange rates and cooperate as appropriate , adding that currency values should reflect fundamentals and excess volatility was undesirable . The dollar had briefly risen on Friday after comments by U . S . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , which market players took to imply that further rises in U . S . interest rates were possible .

Euro Disney rises , annual results seen up . Shares in Euro Disney rose against the trend on Monday on expectations that the Disneyland Paris theme park operator will report a second consecutive annual profit on Tuesday morning at 0630 GMT . The stock was up 10 centimes , or 0 . 9 percent , at 10 . 75 francs at 1120 GMT , while the bourse ' s CAC - 40 index was down 0 . 5 percent . Euro Disney earlier hit a session high of 10 . 85 francs . Share analysts predict the company will report a net profit for the year ended on September 30 of between 160 million and 220 million francs . Excluding exceptional items , analysts expect a 1995 / 96 profit between 100 million and 140 million francs . After losing more than seven billion francs in its first two years , Euro Disney emerged from the red for the first time last year when it reported a net 1994 / 95 profit of 114 million francs and a 21 percent jump in attendance to 10 . 7 million people . Excluding an extraordinary gain from the repurchase of convertible bonds , its profit was two million francs . Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said in September that the company should " do better this year " after a " satisfying " summer season . " People are expecting very good results tomorrow , " one trader said . Analyst Jacques Falzon at brokerage Transbourse expects Euro Disney to show a full - year profit of 200 million francs , but he said recently that he was wary of the stock . " It ' s very speculative . I don ' t recommend it based on the fundamentals . " The share has previously shown a pattern of rising ahead of results expected to show improvement and then tumbling on the figures on heavy profit - taking . Analysts say the company ' s profit growth outlook is clouded by the costs of a 1994 six - billion - franc financial restructuring that are now being phased in . Bourguignon last year said turnover would have to rise four to six percent a year to offset a rise in financial charges estimated at 100 million francs for the year just ended , 200 million for 1996 / 97 , and another 100 million for 1997 / 98 . From 1998 / 99 , royalties and management fees to 39 - percent owner The Walt Disney Co will also be reinstated . Analysts said they will be scrutinising attendance , hotel occupancy , and costs in Tuesday ' s results to gauge the company ' s prospects in a weak consumer spending climate in France . - - Christine Tierney , Paris Newsroom , + 33 1 4221 5452

INTERVIEW - Sainsbury sees Reward as factor . British supermarket group J . Sainsbury Plc ' s Reward loyalty card was a major factor in its improved sales growth , chief executive of Homebase and U . S . businesses David Bremner told Reuters in a telephone interview . " Reward had an impact and probably the majority of the impact , " he said . The company said in a statement that same store sales at its supermarkets were up 4 . 4 percent in the eight weeks to January 11 , moving forward from a three percent rise in October 1996 . But it warned that investment to improve sales would mean full year pretax profits would be around 640 - 650 million pounds excluding a 50 million pound provision , compared with forecasts of just over 700 million pounds previously . " As we build the Reward database , there is clearly a short - term cost in recruitment and administration which will rub out . . . ( it should be ) turning back in our favour next year , " Bremner said . He said the task facing him and chief executive designate of supermarkets Dino Adriano next year was " to improve profits , " adding that " obviously , we would always like to improve sales . " Bremner said that setting up Sainsbury ' s Bank , the banking joint venture with Bank of Scotland which it announced in October , would mean a five million stg impact on operating profits this year . He said Sainsbury was still looking at a first quarter launch for the bank . - - Jo Winterbottom , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

Helms and Gantt close in N . Carolina Senate race . Republican Sen . Jesse Helms and Democratic nominee Harvey Gantt were in a statistical dead heat for North Carolina ' s Senate seat in a CBS News poll conducted this week among 806 registered voters , CBS said on Friday . Helms , 75 , the powerful conservative who headed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , received 45 percent in the poll against 47 percent for former Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt . Both Helms and Gantt , who is 53 , have strong partisan support , said CBS , but one in three voters remain undecided about the election , or say they could still change their minds before Nov . 5 . The poll , conducted among a statewide random sample of 1 , 036 adults and 802 registered voters by telephone from Oct . 13 - 16 , has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points , CBS said . Half the voter sampling viewed Helms as too extreme for North Carolina and 44 percent said Gantt was not too liberal for North Carolina . Voters cited Helms ' issue positions as a major concern and also cited his age , CBS said . Helms , first sent to the Senate in 1972 , and Gantt fought a close race six years ago in which Helms won narrowly after using controversial television ads suggesting that Gantt , who is black , would take jobs away from whites and give them to blacks . In the current poll , 53 percent of registered voters said Helms was spending more time attacking Gantt than explaining what he would do in another term as senator . Voters said they believed Gantt was doing more explaining than attacking . Thirty - three percent said they thought this year ' s campaign has so far been more positive than the previous contest between the two .

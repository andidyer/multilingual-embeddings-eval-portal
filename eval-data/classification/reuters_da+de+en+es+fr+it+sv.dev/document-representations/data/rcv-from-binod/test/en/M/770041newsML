Some investors not ready for U . S . market downturn . U . S . Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt said Thursday he is concerned that many investors are not prepared for a potential downturn in the stock market . " I always worry in the face of an exuberant market about investors who are more emotional than intellectual about their investment decisions , " Levitt told Reuters in an interview . Further he cautioned that regulators both in the United States and abroad need to improve how they would coordinate oversight in times of market crises . Levitt ' s concerns come as Wall Street stocks have surged , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching all - time highs and some market players bracing for a correction . " There is a large group of investors that has never experienced a down market , " Levitt said . " I ' m not predicting any decline , but I am saying that investors have to be prepared in volatile markets . " However , he warned that markets go down as well as up . " My experience in the markets tells me that markets don ' t go one way , and investors have to be prepared for volatility , particularly in markets that have become as globalized as ours , " he said .

British authors urge Iran to release jailed writer . British writers gathered outside the Iranian embassy in London on Monday , calling for the release of jailed newspaper editor Faraj Sarkuhi . Around 40 demonstrators , including authors Rachel Billington and Richard Holroyd , waved banners demanding the Iranian authorities free Sarkuhi , who was arrested in April trying to leave Iran illegally . The only reaction from the embassy was to turn security cameras towards the group . Organised by PEN , an international club for writers , the protest was the latest in a long campaign of weekly demonstrations and open letters to the Tehran government . Concern has been mounting among human rights groups since Iran said Sarkuhi was to be tried for espionage . As rumours swirled over Sarkuhi ' s whereabouts , PEN said it believed an additional charge of adultery has now been laid . Both espionage and adultery are punishable by death in Iran . Some campaigners said they were optimistic Sarkuhi may be spared under Iran ' s new President Khatemi who committed himself to freedom of expression and human rights in his election campaign . " We ' re hoping President Khatami will be more lenient , " said PEN chairman Morris Farhi . " If Sarkuhi is still alive , this may be an indication of Khatami ' s good intentions . However PEN ' s president , Josephine Pullein - Thompson said she believed Islamic fundamentalists in Iran would still have the final say . Sarkuhi was editor of the monthly Adineh ( Friday ) newspaper before disappearing last November . His wife , who lives in Germany with their two children , said earlier this year she feared he was being held as a bargaining chip after Germany accused Iran of being behind the 1992 killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin . A letter allegedly written by Sarkuhi says he was held for six weeks by the Iranian secret service and forced under torture to confess to spying for Germany .

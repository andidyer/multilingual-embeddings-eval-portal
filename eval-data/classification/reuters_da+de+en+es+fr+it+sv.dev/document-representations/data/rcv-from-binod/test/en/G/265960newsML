Criticism of U . S . debt marks U . N . speeches . Apparently fearing the United States would move the goalposts and still not pay its U . N . dues , several speakers on Tuesday expressed apprehension during the swearing in ceremonies for a new secretary - general . U . S . Ambassador Madeleine Albright winced when outgoing Secretary - General Boutros Boutros - Ghali told the 185 - member assembly : " Now that a new secretary - general is being appointed , all arrears should be paid at once , as has been promised so often in the past few months . " He spoke shortly before his successor , Kofi Annan of Ghana , was sworn in before the 185 - member General Assembly . In a gentler tone , Annan , in his acceptance speech , alluded to the U . S . arrears , which now equal $ 1 . 3 billion , by speaking of " financial starvation . " " Applaud us when we prevail ; correct us when we fail ; but , above all , do not let this indispensable , irreplaceable institution wither , languish or perish as a result of member state indifference , inattention or financial starvation . " Angriest was Razali Ismail , the Malaysian General Assembly president . " The United Nations should not be donor driven , we do not covet the Bretton - Woods impersonation award , " he said in reference to U . S . domination of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . " And although finance and finite resources may be facts of life , the secretary - general should not have to pose as a mendicant , petitioning government and legislatures alike , at the expense of all else , " he added . Razali also rapped diplomats from member states in general . " Although many are brilliant , some are creatures of habit and process , suffering apoplexy at each prospect of change , " he said . Albright herself , who will become secretary of state next year , defended U . S . participation in the world body and chided those who thought otherwsie . Some , she said , believed the United Nations was " too encumbered by habits of the past and too divided by its very nature to achieve high standards of efficiency and performance . " " My government is among those having a different and more optimistic view , " she added . The Clinton administration said on Tuesday it was planning to pay its U . N . debts if U . N . members agreed to reduce Washington ' s share from 30 percent to 25 percent . But Republican congressmen in the international relations subcommittee that deals with the United Nations indicated an escalation in demands , such as giving Washington credit for all voluntary contributions in oversees ventures .

Brazil unsure of impact of import finance move . The Brazilian government is unsure of the impact of new rules for short - term import finance except that they will end interest rate arbitrage currently enjoyed by importers , a Finance Ministry official said . " I don ' t know exactly ( what impact the rules will have ) . We do know it will end the arbitrage ( in domestic and external interest rates ) that were giving imports an advantage , " said Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros , economic policy secretary . The government published Wednesday limits on import financing of less than 360 days , forcing importers to take out foreign exchange contracts the day they pick up their goods . Mendonca de Barros said this leveled the playing field in terms of financing rules between exports and imports and stopped importers from depositing their credit and benefiting from Brazilian interest rates before paying for their goods . " Only the future will tell what impact this has ( on the trade balance ) , " Mendonca de Barros said , adding , however , that it was likely to discourage imports that had only been brought in to raise cash for arbitrage . " The important objective is to maintain the commercial competitiveness ( of national products ) by getting rid of this peculiar situation that had developed , " he said . Asked by reporters whether the measures may raise the cost of imported products and therefore have an impact on inflation , Mendonca de Barros once again said he did not know . But he noted that the result of the arbitrage had been seen in " super profits " for importers rather than in lower costs . The new rules , which do not affect imports financed at over 360 days , fuel and lubricants nor imports worth less than $ 10 , 000 , apply to shipments made after March 31 . Brazil has posted a trade deficit for the year so far of some $ 2 . 8 billion after 1996 ' s $ 5 . 5 billion gap . ( ( - - Michael Christie , Brasilia newsroom 55 - 61 - 2230358 ) )

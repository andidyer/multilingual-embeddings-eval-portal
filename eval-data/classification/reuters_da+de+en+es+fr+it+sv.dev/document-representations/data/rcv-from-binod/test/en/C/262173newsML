HEI sees lower margins . HEI Inc said Tuesday a transition to volume pricing late in the fiscal first quarter will result in lower margin rates in the second quarter and throughout the remainder of fiscal 1997 . Earlier today HEI , which makes ultra - miniature microelectronic devices and high - technology products that use those devices , reported earnings for the first quarter ended November 30 of $ 0 . 24 a share , up from $ 0 . 06 a year ago . Revenues for the quarter rose to $ 6 , 528 , 000 from $ 4 , 710 , 000 . Increased revenues , starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 , reflected higher volume production of a device for use in high - density disk drives . However , significantly lower gross margins are anticipated as full volume pricing is reached , HEI said . " We see continuing trends in our markets for reduced package sizes , and toward outsourced high technology services such as those offered by HEI , " Eugene Courtney , president , said in a statement . " With a significant increase in manufacturing plant capacity now in place , we are aggressively pursuing the addition of the necessary staffing to accommodate these new opportunities , and remain optimistic about our longer - term growth prospects , " he said .

German call money trades steady around 3 . 00 pct . German call money rates traded mostly unchanged at around three percent on Monday amid still ample liquidity conditions . The bulk of trades was conducted around three percent , slightly more relaxed than Friday ' s rates of 3 . 02 when dealers were worried about the possibility of rising German interest rates . After the Bundesbank last Thursday declined to announce the interest rate levels for all four securities repurchase tenders during its four week holiday , dealers had begun to speculate the Bundesbank might be preparing to nudge rates higher . But German dealers and economists on Monday said such talk was premature and that there was very little chance the Bundesbank would return to a variable rate tender in three weeks . The Bundesbank has kept its main money market rate , the repo , fixed at three percent for almost a year . Dealers said reserve holdings at the Bundesbank looked to be acceptable which could pave the way for a smoother month end . " We still have a small deficit in our reserve holdings , " one dealer said , adding that this sesison ' s holdings should be near Friday ' s levels , when banks held 41 . 8 billion marks . Lombard borrowings on Friday were negligible . The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average was set at 3 . 02675 percent on Monday after 3 . 02800 percent on Friday . - - Frankfurt Newsroom , + 49 69 756525

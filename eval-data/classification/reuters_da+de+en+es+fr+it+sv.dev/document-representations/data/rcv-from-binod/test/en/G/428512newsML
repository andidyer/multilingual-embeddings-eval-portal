UK teacher adds Stone Age caveman to family tree . British scientists were on Saturday celebrating their feat in tracing a living descendant of a 9 , 000 - year - old skeleton and establishing the world ' s oldest known family tree . In an astonishing piece of detective work , they matched DNA material extracted from the tooth cavity of Britain ' s oldest complete skeleton with that of a 42 - year - old history teacher . The genetic material showed without doubt that teacher Adrian Targett is a direct descendant through his mother ' s line of the skeleton known as Cheddar Man - - found in 1903 in caves in Cheddar Gorge in south - west England . " It is extraordinary that the DNA survives at all but we were able to extract it and sequence it , " said Bryan Sykes of Oxford University ' s Institute of Molecular Medicine . " They would have shared a common ancestor about 10 , 000 years ago so they are related , " Sykes added . Targett lives less than a mile from the caves where Cheddar Man was found . Previous tests have shown that Cheddar Man suffered a violent death at the age of about 23 in 7150 BC . The Oxford University team spent months analysing samples from the skeleton before taking DNA swabs from about 20 local people whose families had lived in the Cheddar area for generations . Targett , who teaches modern history , said he took part only to make up the numbers . " I was astonished when the scientists said I was the descendant . Appropriately enough I am a history teacher but I have to admit I know next to nothing about Cheddar Man . I suppose I really should try to include him in my family tree , " he told reporters . Targett can now boast a lineage centuries older than that of Britain ' s royal family which traces its heritage back to 829 AD . The oldest previously recorded relative was the great - great great - great grandfather of Confucius , who lived in the 8th century BC . Scientists said the odds on finding a match were not as enormous as might appear because of the relatively small number of people who lived in Britain ' s Stone Age . Sykes said the discovery strengthened the theory that the ancestors of modern - day Britons were hunter - gatherers rather than farmers . " There has been an idea that most modern European are decsended from farmers that came in from the Middle East about 10 , 000 years ago , reaching Britain about 6 , 000 years ago . " This kind of evidence shows that is probably not true and that modern Britons are in fact descended from the earlier inhabitants like Cheddar Man who existed on hunting and gathering and who were not farmers , " Sykes told BBC radio . Scientists said they were now hoping to use the same DNA sampling technique to prove whether Neanderthal man , which died out about 25 , 000 years ago , was linked to homo - sapiens humans or was a completely different species . Professor Chris Stringer , a researcher at the Natural History Museum , said : " This work may finally let us end a 150 - year - old argument which has existed since a Neanderthal man fossil was first found . " Targett , an only child who has no children himself , was still coming to terms with the idea of having a caveman as a relative . But his wife Catherine said ; " Maybe this explains why he likes his steaks rare . "

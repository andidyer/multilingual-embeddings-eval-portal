Northeast ' s Q4 heralds tough 1997 - - analysts . Northeast Utilities ' fourth - quarter results announced late on Tuesday were the final blow of a very bad year , casting a grim shadow over the company ' s prospects in 1997 , analysts said . New England ' s biggest utility reported a fourth - quarter loss of $ 76 . 4 million , or 60 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 64 . 2 million , or 50 cents a share , in the fourth quarter of 1995 . Analysts had expected a fourth - quarter loss of around four cents per share , according to First Call , which tracks estimates . Northeast remains plagued by two major challenges - - fixing its troubled nuclear operation , and coping with imminent electricity industry dereguation , first in New Hampshire , and eventually in Massachusetts and Connecticut , analysts said . " They ' ve got two huge challenges in 1997 - - that ' s what makes the picture grim , " said Barry Abramson , an analyst at Prudential Securities . " One of them will take a lot of money and time , " he said , referring to the company ' s efforts to restart its three Millstone nuclear plants in Waterford , Conn . " The other is more uncertain - - how they can resolve the issue of being a large , high - cost producer in an industry that ' s about to be deregulated . " " Nineteen ninety - seven is going to be their watershed year , the year that tells the tale , " said Ed Tirello , analyst at NatWest Securities . " If they get through it , they should be okay . But if the New Hampshire outcome is not as we hoped , and if they don ' t get at least one Millstone plant back up and running , I think they ' re in real trouble . " All three units at the Millstone nuclear power station , with a combined capacity of 2 , 700 megawatts ( MW ) , have been shut since March of last year amid safety concerns raised by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) . Northeast said last month it expected to have all three plants ready for restart by early 1998 , pending approval by the NRC . To compensate for the loss of nearly half of Connecticut ' s power generation , Northeast has been purchasing power at a cost of around $ 30 million a month . " We are hopeful of having at least one of the nuclear units back on line in the third quarter ( of 1997 ) , and that will go a long way toward improving our situation , " Northeast spokesman Tom Shiel told Reuters . Northeast attributed the weak results mainly to its nuclear woes , and said the 1996 figures included a $ 63 million accounting reserve to help pay for 1997 expenditures related to the company ' s nuclear program . Analysts said the Millstone shutdown remains a major cash - flow problem for Northeast , which last summer cut its quarterly dividend to 25 cents from 44 cents to save cash . An elimination of the dividend is likely this year , said Dan Scotto , analyst at Bear , Stearns & Co . " There ' s a better than 50 - 50 chance that they might have to eliminate their dividend this year , if there ' s no positive momentum anywhere , in order to appease the lenders , " he said . Scotto said 1997 would be " a very tough year " for the company . " I do not expect to see positive 1997 earnings for the company . It ' s hard to be optimistic at all about earnings prospects for 1997 . " The company is also grappling with an imminent and unfavorable deregulation situation in New Hampshire . Northeast warned on Jan . 17 that two of its largest operating units - - Public Service Co . of New Hampshire ( PSNH ) and North Atlantic Energy Corp . - - could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection and write off assets valued at about $ 800 million if New Hampshire proceeds with an electricity deregulation plan . " Deregulation in New Hampshire is big - time , because PSNH has been the one company that was making money , " said Penelope Adelmann , analyst at Gruntal & Co . Between Millstone and New Hampshire deregulation , " It ' s kind of like , pick your poison , " said Scotto . Analysts said the company ' s share price , which dipped 0 - 1 / 4 to 12 - 1 / 2 on Tuesday , could re - test its October 1996 lows around 9 - 1 / 2 if New Hampshire deregulation is not resolved in Northeast ' s favor .

USOC TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE OLYMPIC BID AT MEETING . The United States Olympic Committee was set to discuss a possible bid for the 2008 Olympic Games at a board meeting in Philadelphia next month , a spokesman said Saturday . " It ' s very possible that by the conclusion of the ( board ) meeting we will have decided whether we ' re going to move ahead and if so , which year , " USOC spokesman Mike Moran told Reuters . USOC President Bill Hybl received approval from the executive committee Saturday to put the item on the February agenda , Moran said . But no opinions were expressed at the meeting in Colorado Springs , Colorado , on whether the USOC should put forth a U . S . city for the 2008 games or wait for future games , he said . A number of American cities , including Boston , Chicago , Houston , New York and Seattle were keen to host the 2008 Summer Olympics . " We don ' t want to do anything to discourage their enthusiasm , " Moran said of the interested cities . The executive committee of the USOC will meet in Philadelphia on Feb . 14 and the full board will meet on Feb . 15 and 16 , Moran said . In addition , the USOC will hold a three - hour " informational meeting " on Feb . 12 in Philadelphia " for a wide range of U . S . cities " to let them know what bidding for the Olympics entails , he said . That meeting will also impart details on bidding for other events such as U . S . Olympic trials , Moran said .

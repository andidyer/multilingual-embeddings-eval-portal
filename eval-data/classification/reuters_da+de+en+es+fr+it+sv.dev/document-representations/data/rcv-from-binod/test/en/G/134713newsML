Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that French President Jacques Chirac had delivered a positive report from Syria and he hoped to revive peace talks with Damascus .

Chirac met Syrian President Hafez al - Assad for 14 hours before arriving in Israel , he said . " Obviously we very much value the readiness of France to try to help us in the effort we are making in order to reach a discussion obviously - - obviously in the end to renew the bilateral negotaitons between us and Syria , " Netanyahu said . About talks with Palestinians on a long promised Israeli troop pullback from Hebron , the Israeli leader said : " It ' s close to an end , it ' s not yet finished . I hope it will end quickly . " Netanyahu , elected in May , said he expected that when agreement was reached , he and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat would meet to announce the deal . " I am convinced that the moment we reach the finish line there could be - - and it ' s even desirable for there to be - - a meeting between me and Arafat in order to close all the loose ends and enable of course the official announcement on the end of the negotiations , " he said .

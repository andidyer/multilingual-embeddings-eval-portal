Dlr seen edging up despite fears of BOJ . The dollar is likely to edge up against the yen in Asia on Tuesday , helped by its rise against the mark overnight and the recovery in U . S . stocks , although fears of Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) intervention will stay intact . " Given the dollar ' s gain against the mark and the fact the dollar / yen rate broke through 126 . 50 yen overnight , sentiment is strong , " said a city bank dealer . " The market may test if any BOJ dollar - selling intervention will really does take place on rises , " he added . He said some Japanese investors who had missed out on chances to buy enough dollars may be forced to buy them just below 126 . 50 yen . The city bank dealer said investors ' demand for dollar may help it rise to as high as 127 yen or near its recent high of 127 . 16 yen . Downside could be limited to around 126 . 20 yen . A trust bank dealer said fears of BOJ intervention could make traders wary of pushing the dollar up quickly . However , as long as the dollar ' s rise is gradual , the Japanese monetary authorities may refrain from intervening in the market , he added . He said Japanese officials are expected to talk down the dollar first , whenever the pace of its rise is rapid . The trust bank dealer said the mark shed its gains against the yen overnight , but could be supported at 73 . 00 yen . " If the mark will be well - supported at that level , that will indirectly help push the dollar up against the yen , " he added . The dollar has support at around 1 . 7270 marks . The dollar soared to 1 . 7310 marks , its highest level in more than three years . Traders attributed the late surge primarily to dollar purchases by a large U . S . investment bank . The dollar closed higher in New York on Friday amid expectations for continued low interest rates in Japan and Europe and higher rates in the United States .

French crime rate dips for second year . The crime rate in France fell for the second year in a row in 1996 , Interior Minister Jean - Louis Debre said on Wednesday . The number of registered crimes and offences fell 2 . 88 percent from 1995 . " Over two years , there has been a fall of almost 10 percent in crime in France , " Debre told a news conference . " Today crime is back to a level below that of 1991 . " While hailing the fall , he said he was worried by rising crime among the young and a high level of offences linked to drugs . The centre - right government has sought to stiffen sanctions while a heightened police presence in many cities after a wave of bombings by Algerian extremists in 1995 that killed eight people may have discouraged crime .

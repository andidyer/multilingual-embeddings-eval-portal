FOCUS - London shares mark time amid election torpor . Share prices in London inched higher in dull trade on Thursday , marking time with voting underway in Britain ' s general election , while the dollar retreated from a fresh multi - year high against the yen . Trading was constrained with most of Europe ' s key financial markets other than London closed for the May 1 holiday and yet more vital U . S . economic indicators due later in the day and on Friday . London shares drew early comfort from Wall Street ' s third day of gains which carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 7 , 000 for the first time in seven weeks on Wednesday . The Dow rose 46 . 96 points to close at 7 , 008 . 99 , a day after soaring 179 points in its second largest points gain ever . The U . S . index is within reach of its March 11 record close of 7 , 085 . 16 and has now recaptured more than 600 of the 700 points it lost between March 11 and April 11 on worries over corporate profitability and fears of higher interest rates . " This market truly has been manic - depressive in the last six weeks , " U . S . - based Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd , said of Wall Street . Another U . S . economic statistic will keep stock traders on the edge of their seats on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday . The National Association of Purchasing Management ' s manufacturing index for April , due out at 1400 GMT , is expected to fall to 53 . 6 from 55 . 0 in March , according to a Reuters poll . The U . S . April jobs report due on Friday is among those the U . S . Federal Reserve central bank watches closely in gauging inflation pressures . Global financial markets are highly sensitive to U . S . economic statistics as investors try to guess whether the Federal Open Market Committee , the central bank ' s policy arm , will raise interest rates again when it meets on May 20 . It nudged a key short - term rate up by a quarter point on March 25 to counter inflationary pressures . London ' s FTSE index of blue chip shares was up 2 . 3 points at 4 , 438 . 3 approaching midday in gentle trade , after prices had been unexpectedly squeezed higher earlier only to fall back . " The market will find it very difficult to make much progress now the election is upon us , " said one trader . " Despite the fact that Wall Street was up . . . it will be a very dull day . " Britain ' s monetary authorities are due to meet next Wednesday to discuss policy but dealers said they did not expect a rate rise so soon after the election . Politics is likely to dominate the rest of the day and the latest opinion polls continue to forecast a resounding victory for the opposition Labour party after 18 years of Conservative rule . The polls have consistently shown Labour to be well ahead in the race and dealers said a Labour win was already factored into prices . " Thoughts are turned now to the size of the majority , " one said . In currencies , the dollar was just below a fresh multi - year high against the yen at the start of European trade , its sentiment buoyed by a series of strong U . S . economic data and a rise in U . S . asset markets on Wednesday . However the dollar ' s energy , which pushed it to a 55 - month high against the yen in the Asian session , ebbed slightly as most European markets were closed for the May 1 holiday . The dollar was at 127 . 10 yen around midday after hitting 127 . 45 yen earlier , according to Bank of Japan data , its highest since August 1992 . Dollar / yen was at 126 . 95 in late European trade on Wednesday . It was at 1 . 7276 marks against 1 . 7216 late on Wednesday . Analysts said that with European trading expected to be quiet , dollar / mark was unlikely to challenge the 37 - month high of 1 . 7375 it reached last month . Meanwhile , the pound made a firm start against the dollar and mark , although it was stuck in a range as the market awaited the election results after the markets close . It was trading at about 1 . 6223 dollars compared with 1 . 6225 late on Wednesday . The Irish pound was also expected to continue its slide after hitting a five - year low against sterling on Wednesday . It dropped 6 . 5 pfennigs against the mark after Ireland ' s central bank indicated it was not going to intervene to shore up the ailing currency . The punt encountered huge selling pressure on the assumption that Ireland would have to drop to the central rate within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism if it hopes to enter a single currency in 1999 . This would imply a level of 2 . 41 against the mark , dealers said . " There is still huge downside potential in the Irish pound , " AIB Group Treasury economist Oliver Mangan told Reuters . " We believe the mark / Irish will find a floor at around 2 . 53 marks by which stage the forward rates will be discounting a move back to its ERM central parity . " The Irish unit fell to 0 . 9165 sterling by midmorning from a close of 0 . 9248 on Wednesday . It dropped to 2 . 5684 marks from a close of 2 . 5992 .

ASEAN ministers to meet Hun Sen in Cambodia . Three Southeast Asian foreign ministers will meet Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh on Saturday to seek a solution to the country ' s political crisis , officials said . Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas , Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and Domingo Siazon of the Philippines will arrive on Saturday morning for one day of talks with Hun Sen and Foreign Minister Ung Huot , they said . " ( The trip ) is a result of the decision by ASEAN to delay Cambodia ' s membership and send a delegation to meet with the government to discuss the situation , " said You Ay , director general of the ASEAN department at the Cambodian foreign ministry . The visit of the three ministers , mandated by the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , will focus on resolving Cambodia ' s political crisis and putting Cambodia ' s bid to join ASEAN back on track , ASEAN diplomats in Phnom Penh said . ASEAN put Cambodia ' s expected July entry into the grouping on hold earlier this month after Hun Sen overthrew First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a weekend of fighting in the capital on July 5 - 6 . In what political analysts see as a bid to legitimise his takeover , Hun Sen has said he wants to preserve the coalition between his Cambodian People ' s Party ( CPP ) and Ranariddh ' s FUNCINPEC . He said he did not want the job of first prime minister and has supported the candidacy of Ung Huot , selected by some FUNCINPEC members as their choice for the job on Wednesday . To win over the three ministers , Hun Sen and Ung Huot - - who will meet the delegation in his role as foreign minister - - will have to keep making moves towards preserving Cambodia ' s coalition government and democratic system , diplomats said . " They have to show they are moving toward adhering to ( democracy ) . We are encouraged by the recent developments and think membership may be possible by the end of the year , " one ASEAN diplomat told Reuters . At a news conference on Thursday , Hun Sen expressed optimism over Cambodia ' s entry . He said ASEAN ministers had been told that delaying Cambodia ' s membership would only worsen the country ' s situation . The three ministers were due to meet King Norodom Sihanouk on Thursday in Beijing , where Sihanouk is receiving medical treatment , to promote a negotiated settlement in Cambodia . ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . Laos and Burma are slated to join the regional grouping later this month .

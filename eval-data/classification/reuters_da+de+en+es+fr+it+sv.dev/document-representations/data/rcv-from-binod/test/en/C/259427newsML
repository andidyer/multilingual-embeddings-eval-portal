Dole sees Q4 net up over 100 percent . Dole Food Co Inc said it expects fourth quarter earnings to improve over 100 percent from the prior year , despite poor market conditions in the European Union and floods that have affected operations in Guatemala and Honduras . The company said it will be downsizing its dried fruit and nut business and accordingly will be taking a fourth quarter charge of about $ 50 million . It said this initiative will relieve future operations of sizable losses associated with this business and allow a substantial reduction in Dole ' s working capital . Dole said the initiative fits previously announced plans to dispose of assets which do not meet the company ' s minimum return on investment requirement . A spokesman for Dole said the company ' s fourth quarter forecast excludes the $ 50 million charge and compares with earnings from continuing operations of $ 5 . 3 million or $ 0 . 09 a share in the year ago quarter . According to First Call , analysts had been expecting the company to post fourth quarter profits of around $ 0 . 37 a share . Dole shares were down 2 - 3 / 4 to 33 .

Japan Apr - Sept current account surplus down 35 pct . Japan ' s huge current account surplus plunged by more than a third in the half year to September despite a weakening of the yen . The current account surplus - - the broadest measure of trade in goods and services - - fell 35 . 3 percent to 3 . 33 trillion yen for the first half of the fiscal year which started in April , the Ministry of Finance announced on Monday . At Monday ' s exchange rate of around 112 yen to the dollar , the first - half current account surplus was equivalent to $ 29 . 7 billion . The surplus in merchandise trade alone in the six months decreased by 32 . 1 percent to 4 . 155 trillion yen ( $ 37 billion ) from the same period a year earlier . Economists said the rise in the dollar , from about 107 yen at the beginning of the fiscal year to about 111 . 5 yen at the end of September , was slowing the pace of the drop in the surplus . " We ' ve seen export values increase since mid - 1995 and the increase in imports has been flattening since the beginning of 1996 , " said Mikihiro Matsuoka , economist at Daiwa Institute of Research . Economists said the weaker yen has fuelled a rebound in exports and capped growth in imports . " It is clear that the decline in the merchandise trade is slowing down , " said Nikko Research Centre economist Tetsuro Sawano . " So the general trend of the current account surplus is that it will continue to fall but at a milder rate . " A ministry official said the weak yen was not having a major impact on Japan ' s trade balance . " Japan ' s trade surplus continues its declining trend . . . The weak yen is not causing any major effects , " the official told reporters . The ministry also released figures for the September current account surplus , which fell 35 . 6 percent from a year earlier to 727 . 4 billion yen ( $ 6 . 49 billion ) . The merchandise trade surplus for September slid 27 . 1 percent to 973 . 7 billion yen ( $ 8 . 69 billion ) . Economists , on average , had expected the September current account surplus to have fallen to 860 . 7 billion yen ( $ 7 . 68 billion ) in September from 1 . 13 trillion yen ( $ 10 . 0 billion ) a year earlier . " We could expect the pace of slowdown or reduction in the trade surplus and current account surplus to continue in the coming months , " Matsuoka said . ( $ 1 = 112 yen )

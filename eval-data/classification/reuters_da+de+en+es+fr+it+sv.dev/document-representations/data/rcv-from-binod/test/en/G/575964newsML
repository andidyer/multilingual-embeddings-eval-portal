Key defendant keeps secrets at Vietnam drugs trial . The key defendant in Vietnam ' s dramatic drugs trial has denied that he was the kingpin in a cross - border trafficking ring , but has failed to make good on his promise to expose some " very important people " . The Lao Dong newspaper said on Monday that Vu Xuan Truong , a former captain in the Interior Ministry ' s anti - crime unit , accused a fellow defendant of masterminding the syndicate but mentioned no other names . Truong , who has said he expects to face the firing squad for his crime , urged the Hanoi People ' s Court to hand out stiff sentences when the closed - door trial ends on Wednesday . Lao Dong said Truong had asked the board of judges " to be tough with such the kind of crime that I committed because the damage that drugs cause is a serious threat to the existence of the entire human race " . Sources who attended the trial on Monday said Truong , who has tried to commit suicide twice , told the court that he did not intend to appeal against his sentence and asked to be executed as soon as possible . The prosecution has called for eight of the 22 accused , half of whom are police officers and border guards , to be sentenced to death . It reccomended that eight others be jailed for life and the rest get various prison sentences of up to 20 years . Truong stands accused of playing a key role in flooding the country with more than 300 kg ( 660 pounds ) of heroin from remote corners of Thailand , Laos and Burma over several years . He vowed before the trial began to implicate some " extremely important people " in the still - widening scandal in return for the lives of his co - defendant wife and brother being spared . But instead of naming new names he told the court that the ringleader was fellow defendant Nguyen Trong Thang , an import - export company employee whom the prosecution said should die .

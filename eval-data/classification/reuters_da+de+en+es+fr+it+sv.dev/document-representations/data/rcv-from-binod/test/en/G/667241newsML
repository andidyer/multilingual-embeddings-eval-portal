Macedonian leader wants peace troops in Balkans . U . S . President Bill Clinton met Tuesday with President Kiro Gligorov of Macedonia , who said NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia should stay in the region and offered to keep some or all of them in his country . Gligorov , speaking with reporters after meeting Clinton , was asked for his thoughts about the United States ' decision to withdraw its troops from the peacekeeping force by June 1998 . " I firmly believe that the presence of peace forces has greatly contributed to settling this issue and ending the senseless war " in Bosnia , he said . " It ended the killing of the people , it ended ethnic cleansing and therefore I believe that their remaining on the Balkans and in this region where Macedonia also is located would be very positive , " he said . Gligorov said that Macedonia " also is ready to accept a part of their presence or the overall presence in the country . " The United States has about 500 peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslav republic , about half the U . N . peace force there . Although Washington has insisted it plans to end its participation in the Bosnia mission by mid - 1998 , it has been open to extending the Macedonia peace mission beyond that date .

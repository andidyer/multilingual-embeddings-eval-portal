Western Resources extends KC Power offer . Western Resources Inc said Friday it is extending the expiration date of its exchange offer for Kansas City Power and Light Co to October 25 from September 20 . Western Rsources ' hostile bid for Kansas City Power competes with that company ' s agreement to merge with UtiliCorp United Inc . At the close of business on August 29 , Kansas City Power ' s shareowners had tendered 1 . 2 million shares of common stock . " Extending the expiration date is a normal practice in this type of transaction , " John Hayes Jr , Western Resources chairman , said in a statement . " KCPL shareowners have just voted on the UtiliCorp proposal . We believe most KCPL shareowners are interested in knowing the final vote before they tender their shares to us . " He added the extension of Western Resources ' offer accomodates the expected mid - September certification of the Kansas City Power shareholder vote on the UtiliCorp plan . " We are still very confident that KCPL management not only failed to receive the legally required two - thirds vote , but also failed to receive even a simple majority of those voting on the proposed merger with UtiliCorp , " Hayes said . He said Kansas City Power shareowners who tender their shares for $ 31 worth of Western Resources shares will continue to have Kansas City Power voting rights and will be paid the dividend until the exchange is completed .

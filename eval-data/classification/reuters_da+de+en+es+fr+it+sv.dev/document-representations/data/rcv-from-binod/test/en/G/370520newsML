Shuttle Discovery fueled for pre - dawn launch . NASA technicians began fuelling the shuttle Discovery on Monday evening after determining that mysterious oxygen readings wouldn ' t delay the spaceship ' s launch on a mission to upgrade the $ 1 . 6 billion Hubble Space Telescope . Two days after the launch , the shuttle ' s crew was to rendezvous with the orbiting telescope and capture it . Four spacewalks are planned to install two new scientific instruments and upgrade various ageing components . Seven years ago , the Hubble telescope was placed into orbit by astronaut Steve Hawley , who will be on this mission to make the improvements to the delicate instrument . Hawley , a 45 - year - old astronomer , is scheduled to use the shuttle ' s robot arm to pluck the telescope out of orbit and place it in the payload bay for the operation . Filling the orbiter ' s giant orange fuel tank began later than planned to allow engineers to finish troubleshooting the higher than usual oxygen concentrations in Discovery ' s fuselage . The orbiter and its seven astronauts were scheduled for liftoff at 3 : 55 a . m . EST ( 0855 GMT ) on Tuesday . " It ' s puzzling , but they do not think it ' s bad enough to keep us on the ground , " said Bruce Buckingham , a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . " We ' ll monitor it throughout the night . " Tests appeared to rule out the possibility that the shuttle ' s fuel cell system had sprung a tiny leak . The fuel cells , which are located beneath the shuttle ' s cargo bay , combine supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to generate electrical power and also manufacture drinking water as a byproduct . " The troubleshooting revealed that we had no significant leaks in the system that we could pick up , " NASA test director Doug Lyons told a news conference on Monday . Engineers suspected the high oxygen could be due to false readings from the shuttle ' s gas detectors or that nitrogen gas used to ventilate the fuselage contained some air . The launch team cleared a second hurdle with the shuttle ' s fuel cells on Monday . Tests showed that a new fuel cell - - one of three aboard the orbiter - - was working properly . There was a concern that chemicals in the new fuel cell might produce drinking water that was too bitter . U . S . Air Force meteorologists expected cloudy skies at the Kennedy Space Centre to clear in time for Discovery ' s predawn blastoff . They gave the shuttle a 70 percent chance of fair weather for the launch .

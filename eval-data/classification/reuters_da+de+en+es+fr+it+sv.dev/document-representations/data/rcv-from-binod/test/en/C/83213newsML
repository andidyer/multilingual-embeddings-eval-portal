Brazil Petrobras mulls refinery investments - paper . Brazilian state oil company Petrobras is considering investments of 800 million reais ( $ 784 million ) in modernising and expanding its Reduc oil refinery in Rio de Janeiro state , a local newspaper said Saturday . The project is currently being drawn up by the company ' s technicians and should be approved by the board of directors at the beginning of next year , according to Jornal do Brasil . " We are very confident , " Victor Manuel Martins Pais , joint - superintendent of Petrobras ' industrial department , told the newspaper . Work on the refinery is expected to last five years after the plan has been approved . Improvements will include technology to turn more fuel oil into gasoline and diesel , consumption of which has grown siginficantly since the start of the government ' s anti - inflation " real " plan in 1994 . This year the increase is expected to be in the range of 10 percent compared with 1995 . Another part of the investment will be used to increase daily capacity by 120 , 000 barrels at the refinery from the current level of 220 , 000 barrels of oil , Jornal do Brasil said . The improvements are deemed necessary because of the increased consumption of combustible fuels in the southeastern states which are supplied by the Reduc refinery . In addition , they are needed to cope with the increased oil production at the nearby offshore Campos Basin which should finish this year with output of 600 , 000 barrels per day . Manuel also said that Petrobras planned to modernise its other nine oil refineries , its asphalt factory in Fortaleza and another factory in Parana . In total the company intended to invest up to six billion reais ( $ 5 . 88 billion ) by the year 2001 , mostly on increased production capacity for gasoline and diesel oil . The new changes will mean that Petrobras can produce more of these products without having to increase imports of crude oil . Another part of the funds will be used to adapt refineries to process gas from the Brazil - Bolivian gas pipeline , work on which should begin in the next few months . - - Caroline Bulloch , Rio de Janeiro newsroom , 5521 5074151

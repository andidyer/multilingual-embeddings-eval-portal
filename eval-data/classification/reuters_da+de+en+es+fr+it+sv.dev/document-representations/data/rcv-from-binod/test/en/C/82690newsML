Japan MOF to set up capital adequacy committee . Japan ' s Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) said on Friday that it would set up a special committee to review the standard for calculating capital adequacy ratios before introducing a so - called " prompt corrective action " ( PCA ) system from April 1998 . The first meeting of the committee is to be held next Monday , and it is expected to meet twice a month to work out details of the capital standards within this year , a ministry official said . MOF was required to establish the PCA system under financial laws passed earlier this year to help tackle Japan ' s bad - loan problem . Under the PCA system , the capital adequacy ratio will be a major gauge of the soundness of financial institutions , and used as a measure to provide an early warning of latent financial trouble . Banking sources said the domestic standard for the ratio of capital to assets for " adequately capitalised " institutions operating within Japan would be set at 4 . 0 percent .

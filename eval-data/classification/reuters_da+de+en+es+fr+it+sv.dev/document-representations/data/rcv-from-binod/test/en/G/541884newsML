UK Conservatives insist election is wide open . Prime Minister John Major was down but insisted he was not yet out of the running in Britain ' s May 1 election despite opinion polls predicting a Labour landslide . Just three days before the election , a Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph on Monday showed Labour ' s support at 49 percent , 19 points ahead of the ruling Conservative . The latest survey was consistent with four polls in Sunday newspapers giving Labour a 15 - 24 point advantage , which could produce a majority of almost 200 in a 659 - seat parliament . Despite the dire warnings , Major shrugged off predictions of doom and held out hope that the Conservatives would come from behind to win an unprecedented fifth consecutive term . " Only Thursday will determine what 30 million British electors will do , " Major said in a television interview . Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine was also insistent that a Labour victory was anything but a certainty and said that with a quarter of voters still undecided the race was wide open . " The Labour Party give the impression that they have got the election in the bag . Nothing can be further from the truth . Over the next four days millions of people will have to decide who they should trust to govern the country , " he said . Hammering home threats of higher taxes , further integration with Europe and a return to crippling trade union powers under a Labour government , the Conservatives are hoping for a repeat of the 1992 result , when they defied poll predictions and pulled off a stunning surprise win . Heseltine said voters will have to decide what kind of country they want . " A low - tax , low mortgage rate , low inflation economy or the Labour model with a return of trade union power and an emergency tax - raising budget in 10 weeks time . " Mindful of the outcome five years ago , Labour Party leader Tony Blair , who has revamped his party and manoeuvred it to the centre , warned against complacency and said he was taking nothing for granted . Looking increasingly confident in the closing days of the campaign , he was greeted with rapturous applause on Sunday evening by more than 3 , 000 supporters in a Nottingham concert hall . " Let us hope that this time next week with the support and trust of the British people we will see the end of this Conservative government and the election of a new Labour government in Britain , " he said . Blair attacked Major for weak leadership in Europe and for favouring the wealthy at the expense of the poor and vulnerable . He also promised that a Labour government would look to the future , not the past . " This country over these next few days is going to make an historic decision . And I say that there is a stark choice . They can have those same old Tories back with all the divisions and the sleaze and the damage to our schools and hospitals and law and order , or they can have a new Labour government . " And the choice is not between the same old Tories and turning the clock back under new Labour . The choice is between those same old Tories and a revitalised Labour government that is going to look to the future , not the past . . . " Although Blair is careful not to talk of victory , the strategists are increasingly focussing on events after May 1 . Aides say that Blair ' s plans for his cabinet are being firmed up and that Treasury spokesman Gordon Brown is preparing to put the key lines of his June budget in the hands of treasury officials as soon as Friday to show that Labour will " hit the ground running " after the election .

Ukraine ' s new hryvnya currency makes shy debut . Ukraine , fulfilling a long - held dream , launched its hryvnya currency on Monday but the new banknotes were hard to come by in many parts of the country . The majority of exchange points failed to open , and only a handful of large banks took in the old karbovanets currency and exchanged it for the new . " I just wanted to see what one of these new little papers looked like , " said a beaming man , who stood in line for 20 minutes for a small pile of one - hryvna notes and gold - coloured kopeck coins . The hryvnya - - whose name is taken from money used during the Kievan Rus empire about 1 , 000 years ago - - was fixed at 1 . 76 to the dollar at its debut on the Ukraine Interbank Currency Exchange , and the central bank said it did not intervene to buoy up the new currency . The hryvnya , launched five years after Ukraine became independent , was selling at 1 . 70 to the dollar at the few street exchange points that were open . The government has set September 16 as the deadline to take the karbovanets out of circulation , but said it may extend it if necessary . One hryvnya is worth 100 , 000 karbovanets , the interim currency which replaced the rouble at the end of 1991 . Many stores avoided the early confusion of having two currencies in circulation at once by staying closed , posting signs that said " Sanitary clean - up day " or " Closed for technical reasons . " Many cash registers will have to be reprogrammed , by removing five zeroes , to make way for the new currency . Some stores had already posted prices in the new hryvnya , sitting alongside karbovanets prices , but most transactions were still being conducted in the old currency . The government also announced a month - long price freeze to start the same day as the hryvnya ' s introduction , but many stores raised their prices immediately after the government announced the date for the hryvnya ' s introduction a week ago . " We probably won ' t see the hryvnya until tomorrow , " one hryvnya - seeking man said , standing next to a display showing samples of the new banknotes at the main post office . The situation outside the capital was much the same , with only a few banks in the western city of Lviv and in the Crimean peninsula distributing the hryvnya . The government has promised to bring money into villages which have no exchange points . Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk said the hryvnya would remain stable at least until the end of the month . " There is nothing in the political situation , nor in the government , nor in the currency reform that can cause prices to rise or that can threaten the level of the hryvnya , " Pynzenyk said at a weekend news conference . Ukraine had promised many times to introduce the new currency but had to delay due to economic problems . With record - low inflation of 0 . 1 percent in June and July and the old karbovanets stable at about 176 , 000 to the dollar for a few months the government felt confident enough to undertake currency reform . The karbovanets , the unwieldy currency better known as the coupon , devalued so quickly in 1994 that one state company recycled worthless small denominations into toilet paper . Bankers have said the real rate of the hryvnya will be established at mid - month , once the karbovanets is fully out of circulation . Ukraine is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on a $ 1 . 5 billion stabilisation fund to back the hryvnya .

Serebyanikov said the share issue , plans for which were dropped from this week ' s annual shareholders ' meeting agenda after protests from foreign investors and likely government intervention , would only take place if the Eurobond and EBRD loan projects fail . A share authorisation would require approval from 75 percent of shareholders at an extraordinary meeting . " If we get the EBRD credit and settle the question of placing Eurobonds , we will not resort to any other types of financing or carry out any extraordinary shareholders meeting , " he said . " But if this doesn ' t work , at the extraordinary meeting there will only be this one question , " he said , referring to the share issue .

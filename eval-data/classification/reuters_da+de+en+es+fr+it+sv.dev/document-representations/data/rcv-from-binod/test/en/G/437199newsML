India says 36 pct of population in dire poverty . India ' s economic planners have changed a key measure of poverty and revised the number of poor in the world ' s second most populous nation to nearly 36 percent , or two times what was thought earlier . Officials said on Wednesday that the Planning Commission had decided to accept the findings of an expert group which showed that 35 . 97 percent , or 320 . 37 million of a population of 930 million , lived below the poverty line in 1993 - 94 ( April - March ) . The poverty line is defined as a monthly income that would allow people to buy two meals a day . The percentage of the population below the line is a matter of hot debate among economists , and determines welfare spending priorities . The centre - left coalition that assumed office last year decided to adopt a more rigid method to estimate poverty . An earlier study made by the commission estimated that only 19 percent of the population was below the poverty line in 1993 / 94 . Many economists had criticised the previous Congress party government for adopting a liberal set of criteria , which they said led to the number poor in the country being vastly understated . According to the revised estimate about 38 . 86 percent or 307 . 05 million of India ' s population lived below the poverty line in 1987 / 88 . The revision in the poverty estimates implies a higher financial burden on the government exchequer . The government has promised to provide subsidised foodgrains to people below the poverty line . The food subsidy bill will go up to 83 billion rupees ( $ 2 . 31 billion ) in 1997 / 98 ( April - March ) from 59 billion rupees in 1996 / 97 , Food Minister Devendra Prasad Yadav said last month . Nearly 37 . 27 percent or 244 . 03 million of Indians in rural areas lived below the poverty line in 1993 / 94 , while 32 . 36 percent or 76 . 34 million people in urban areas were absolute poor , the statement said . Data on poverty has been a key issue in a debate on the efficacy of free market policies launched by former prime minister P . V . Narasimha Rao in 1991 . Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda ' s United Front government has carried the reforms further , but has adopted a more conservative estimate of poverty to fix public spending priorities to feed the poor .

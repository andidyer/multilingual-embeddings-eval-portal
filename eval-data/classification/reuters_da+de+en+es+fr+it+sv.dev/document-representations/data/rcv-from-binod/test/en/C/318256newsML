Indonesia deadline boosts Placer hopes . Placer Dome Inc said on Monday that a one - month deadline given to Barrick Gold Corp and Bre - X Minerals Ltd by the Indonesian government boosted Placer ' s hopes that open bidding would be allowed for Bre - X . A letter sent by the government to Barrick and Bre - X on Friday gave them one month to settle with their local partners on Bre - X ' s rich Busang gold discovery in Indonesia . If they did not meet the deadline , all discussions between them and the government would be canceled and the government would have the right to manage Busang II and III . " We hope that the outcome will be an open bidding process . . . this opens the door more widely ( to that ) , " a Placer spokesman said . Placer jumped into the fray for the Busang discovery in Borneo with a US $ 5 billion proposal to merge with Bre - X last week . It hopes to persuade the Indonesian government , which directed Bre - X to negotiate a joint venture with Barrick last year , to allow competing offers . The spokesman said Placer had had no response or acknowledgement from the Indonesian government on its proposal . Placer confirmed that its chief executive John Willson met Muhammad " Bob " Hasan , a confidant of Indonesian President Suharto , in Indonesia last December . Hasan was " one of those who encouraged us to make a proposal , " the spokesman said . Placer said last week it stepped forward with its offer after encouragement from Indonesia but declined to say who provided the encouragement . Placer said that remained its policy , but the spokesman confirmed the talks with Hasan after he said Willson inadvertently mentioned them to an interviewer last week .

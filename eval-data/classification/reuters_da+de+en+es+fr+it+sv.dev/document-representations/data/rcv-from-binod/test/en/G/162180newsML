MP ' s death imperils Major ' s parliament majority . Prime Minister John Major ' s majority in parliament was cut to just one seat on Sunday when it was announced that one of his Conservative members of parliament , Barry Porter , had died . The death raised the prospect of Major heading a minority government if the Conservatives lose Porter ' s Wirral South constituency at a by - election and the opposition Labour Party retain a seat in another constituency in Northern England . Porter died after a brief illness , a spokeswoman at Conservative headquarters said . Major issued a statement saying his death was " a shock and a sadness to his many friends " . Porter , who had held his seat since 1983 , won a majority of 8 , 183 votes over Labour at the 1992 general election . But far bigger majorities have been surrendered by the Conservatives during the course of the present parliament . The other vacancy , also following the death of the sitting MP , is at Barnsley East , where Labour had a massive 24 , 777 vote majority in 1992 . By - election losses and the defection of three of their MPs to opposition parties have gradually whittled away the Conservatives ' majority , which stood at 21 seats immediately after the last election . The ruling party has suffered from having raised taxes shortly despite a 1992 election manifesto pledge not to do so , from embarrassing internal splits over European policy , and from allegations of sleaze against prominent members . Labour , under its moderate leader Tony Blair , currently holds a lead of more than 20 points in most opinion polls - - more than enough to gain Wirral South . But Major believes that a buoyant economy will help him to win voters back to the Conservatives provided that he can soldier on until close to the latest possible date for a general election - - May 22 next year . " John Major has driven things forward in recent years to make us into a low inflation economy . . . with one of the best economic prospects we have had in a lifetime , " Welsh secretary William Hague said in a BBC television interview on Sunday . Some Conservatives hope that a popular budget on November 26 can swing support their way , although finance minister Kenneth Clarke has pledged not to endanger the economic boom by unjustified tax cuts . Even if Major loses his overall parliamentary majority , he may be able to stay in office , relying on the support of small parties such as the nine - strong Official Ulster Unionists , whose main policy plank is that Northern Ireland must remain British . The Unionists look set to save Major from an embarrassing parliamentary defeat on the issue of gun control within the next few weeks . They have said they will not vote with other opposition parties and a handful of Conservative rebels for a total ban on the ownership of handguns in the aftermath of the Dunblane tragedy in which 16 children and a teacher were shot dead . The government proposes more modest curbs , which would still allow target shooters using . 22 calibre weapons to retain their arms provided they keep them in secure gun clubs .

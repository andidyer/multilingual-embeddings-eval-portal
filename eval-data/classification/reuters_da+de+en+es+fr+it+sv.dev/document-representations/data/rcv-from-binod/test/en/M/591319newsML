CME hog calls mixed , pork bellies higher . Early calls on CME hog futures ranged from 0 . 150 cent per lb lower to 0 . 150 higher while pork bellies were called 0 . 250 to 1 . 000 cent higher , livestock analysts said . Carryover technical pressure and selling prompted by steady to lower cash hog calls were expected to pressure hog futures initially . Further fund liquidation is likely after futures fell to a one month low and touched off sell stops when they went through support at 82 . 700 cents Thursday . The cut in packer kill rates started the break in futures Wednesday , analysts said . However , some analyts look for support to develop quickly based on the large discount of futures to the latest CME lean index . The latest index rose $ 1 . 38 to $ 83 . 88 per cwt , well above June close on Thursday of 82 . 325 . Pork cutout values were also up which may stimulate increased packer interest for hogs , they added . Carryover demand from Thursday ' s limit gains and a strong technical picture , as well as firmer fundamentals , were expected to lift pork belly futures at the start . Futures rose to a one week high in July when it went through the 20 - day average at about 90 . 500 and a trend line at 91 . 500 on Thursday , analysts said . A light slaughter pace and the jump in cash belly prices were cited as strong fundamental factors . Export interest for pork bellies has been fairly good and expectations on next week ' s Cold Storage report point to a possible reduction in U . S . warehouse stocks during April , they said . Early indications on the report range from 52 . 2 to 59 million lbs on hand May 1 compared with 54 . 8 million on hand April 1 and 57 . 2 million in storage May 1 of last year .

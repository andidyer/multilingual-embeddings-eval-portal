PLO , Israel resume talks on pullout from Hebron . Palestinian and Israeli negotiators resumed talks on Tuesday on a long - delayed partial Israeli troop pullout from the West Bank city of Hebron , Israeli radio said . Chief Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) negotiator Mahmoud Abbas met Israeli army chief Lieutenant - General Amnon Shahak near Tel Aviv as part of the effort to seal a deal on Hebron . Israeli and Palestinian officials confirmed earlier that the talks were set to take place . Palestinian President Yasser Arafat met U . S . Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier on Tuesday at a Cairo economic conference to discuss the stalemate in implementing Israeli - PLO interim peace deals . " ( My meeting ) with Mr Christopher was very positive too because we were speaking frankly about all the obstacles which we are facing in the negotiations , " Arafat told reporters upon returning to self - ruled Gaza . Christopher told the Cairo Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference that Arabs and Israelis remained committed to the peace process and he believed agreement on a partial Israeli withdrawal from Hebron was " close at hand . " More than one month of intensive U . S . - brokered talks between PLO and Israeli negotiators have failed to achieve results . Netanyahu wants the Hebron deal signed by Israel ' s previous government modified to safeguard some 400 Jewish settlers in Hebron , home to 100 , 000 Palestinians . Palestinians reject any changes to the signed accords . The Hebron pullout was due to be implemented last March but was delayed after a wave of Islamist suicide attacks killed scores in Israel . Earlier on Tuesday , Jewish settlers shot and lightly wounded a Palestinian woman in a drive - by attack near the West Bank town of Hebron , Arab witnesses said . Officials at Hebron ' s Alia hospital said Naziha Abu - Hmeid , 50 , was in stable condition after being shot in the leg near Yatta village . " While we were waiting on our land near the settlements , two settlers in a blue Subaru came and shot about 10 bullets towards us from their pistols , " Ibrahim Abu Shakir , 55 , told Reuters . " I saw my wife fall down shouting . My son , who was about 50 metres ( yards ) from us , came immediately . The two settlers escaped in their car , " Abu Shakir said . Abu Shakir said he identified the gunmen as settlers by their long beards and skullcaps .

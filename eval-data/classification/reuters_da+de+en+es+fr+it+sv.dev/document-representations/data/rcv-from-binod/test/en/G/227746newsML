SOCCER - LIVERPOOL OUTSHINE SPURS TO JOIN ARSENAL ON TOP . Liverpool pulled level with Arsenal at the top of the English premier league on Monday by comprehensively beating Tottenham 2 - 0 at White Hart Lane with goals on either side of halftime from Michael Thomas and Steve McManaman . Tottenham , reeling from the humiliation of losing 6 - 1 to first division Bolton in the League Cup last week , and down after losing to arch - rivals Arsenal in the league eight days ago , showed plenty of spirit and determination but were never able to master the visitors . Liverpool played with far more creativity and teamwork and , with more luck , could easily have had five . The victory took Liverpool onto 31 points from 15 matches , the same total as Arsenal . But the Gunners , who went top after beating Newcastle on Saturday , remain in first place because of their superior goal difference . While Liverpool deserved their victory at an away ground where they have not lost for the last four seasons , they had the better of all the luck that was going in the early stages . McManaman , the game ' s outstanding player , enjoyed the lion ' s share of it when his speculative low shot from the edge of the box four minutes into the second half hit a bump on the pitch and bounced over goalkeeper Ian Walker who looked set to make a routine save . That was the turning point and Tottenham were rarely in the hunt after that . But there was no luck about Thomas ' s opener . The former Arsenal player scored on the stroke of halftime with a superbly placed angled shot which Walker could only get a despairing hand to . Tottenham had a goal disallowed midway through the second half when Sol Campbell appeared to score but was adjudged to have fouled Liverpool goalkeeper David James . Apart from a header from Teddy Sheringham which James did well to save , Tottenham hardly troubled James , while at the other end in the closing stages Liverpool went close to scoring at least four more goals with McManaman twice - - once with a shot from his own half - - Patrick Berger twice and Robbie Fowler all unlucky not to add to the total .

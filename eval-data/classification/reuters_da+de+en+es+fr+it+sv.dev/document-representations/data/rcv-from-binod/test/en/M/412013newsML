" A lot of people which have blue chip holdings are moving to secondliners and thirdliners , " Irving Ackerman , president of Ackerman & Co said . Buying in thirdliners was subdued on Friday since some were correcting from their steep rises brought about during the week by persistent rumours of backdoor listing . " The rumour mill has been slowing down lately , " Ana Candelaria , investment analyst of Eastern Securities , said . She said punters had become selective on which penny stocks to play . Among the actively traded thirdliners were Itogon Suyoc Mines which added one centavo to 43 centavos , and Araneta Property , up 16 centavos to 1 . 56 pesos . Joey Roxas , president of Eagle Equities , said the huge shares offering of Equitable Banking Corp has prompted some investors to liquefy positions so they could buy the offer .

Newly listed Reynolds Philippines Corp ended five centavos higher to close at 4 . 60 pesos on its second day of trade .

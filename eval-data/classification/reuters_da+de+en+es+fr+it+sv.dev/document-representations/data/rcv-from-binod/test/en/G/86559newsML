RTRS - Bryant pleads not guilty to Port Arthur massacre . The man accused of the worst mass killing in modern Australian history pleaded not guilty on Monday to 35 counts of murder . Martin Bryant , 29 , also denied 20 charges of attempted murder and 17 lesser charges arising from the massacre on April 28 at the historic convict jail of Port Arthur in the southern island state of Tasmania . One charge of attempted murder and another of grievous bodily harm were added to the indictment read out at the Supreme Court of Tasmania in the state capital , Hobart . Bryant ' s not - guilty pleas mean that the case will have to go to a full trial , expected to start on November 19 . Bryant was remanded in custody after the hearing . The courtroom was ringed by heavy security for the hearing , the first time Bryant has appeared in person in court , and the court ' s main access road had been sealed off . Bryant , who wore a light grey suit at the hearing and identified himself in a high , clear voice , has been the subject of numerous death threats since his arrest . During the hearing a man in the public gallery shouted : " You are a bloody coward , Bryant " . The judge ordered the man to leave the court . On April 28 , a sunny Sunday afternoon , a lone gunman walked into the Broad Arrow Cafe at Port Arthur and shot 20 people as they ate their lunch . Within an hour a further 12 people , including a three - year - old girl , were gunned down either outside the cafe , in their cars , or hiding behind a tree . Three people were taken hostage and later found dead in the charred remains of a cottage near the former penal colony . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

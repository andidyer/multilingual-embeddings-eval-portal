Lufthansa ups ex - Europe cargo rates 5 - 9pct . By Paul Needham , Lufthansa Cargo AG will raise ex - Europe cargo rates by five to nine percent from March 1 , Joachim Haas , the airline ' s senior vice president Europe told Reuters in an interview . The increases , varied by departure country and destination , are part of a global rates rise of seven to ten percent announced by the airline . Haas , whose Europe region includes Russia , the Middle East ( excluding the Gulf states ) and Africa , told Reuters in an interview that the rises were justified by the poor financial health of cargo operations at present . " Nearly all airline make a loss in cargo even though the load factor is about 90 percent , " he said . " I have to sell capacity more expensively even if I lose shipments as long as I earn more at the end and by handling less , I have lower costs . " In Germany , which represented about 50 percent of European business , the average rates rise will be in the seven to nine percent range , Haas said . In Italy , the airline ' s second - strongest European market along with Scandinavia with a combined 25 percent revenue share , rates will also increase seven to nine percent . There will be an across - the - board rise of five to seven percent in Scandinavia , where some rates to the Far East , South America and Europe were already increased on January 1 . The UK will see a rise of " at least " five percent , France will have a seven to nine percent rise and Spain and Portugal will have seven to eight percent higher prices . Average Lufthansa rates in the Benelux will rise about nine percent but will vary according to destination . Haas stressed that Lufthansa would maintain its cargo fuel surcharges until jet fuel prices returned to the levels of last summer . There were no plans to convert these surcharges into rates rises , he said . Lufthansa was now introducing escape clauses for fuel , currency and war risk into new , long - term contracts to allow it to react rapidly to external , unforeseeable factors , he added . - - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44 171 542 8982 Fax + 5017

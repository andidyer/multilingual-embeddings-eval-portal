IMF mission due in Sofia on Thursday . An International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission is expected to arrive in Sofia on Thursday to evaluate the pace of reform and draft a budget outline for next year , the IMF office said on Wednesday . The mission is expected to spend two weeks reviewing Bulgaria ' s progress in strengthening financial discipline and agree on reform policies that would unblock a much - needed second $ 115 million tranche . On Tuesday Prime Minister Zhan Videnov said Bulgaria ' s failure to meet macroeconomic targets may clog funding talks with the Fund . Bulgaria ' s gross domestic product ( GDP ) is expected to fall by between 8 . 1 percent and 10 . 5 percent this year and by 2 . 0 to 4 . 0 percent in 1997 , the National Statistics Institute said . The government ' s budget revision made in July forecast zero GDP growth this year , down from an originally planned three percent , annual consumer price inflation of 100 percent and an average annual central interest rate of 68 percent . Huge domestic debt burdens and a banking crisis had pushed the annual interest rate to an all - time high of 300 percent last month , cut to 240 percent 10 days ago . The IMF postponed a $ 115 million tranche last month until the government fulfilled its pledges to close loss - making state enterprises and speed up privatisation . Two or three state loss - making companies out of the pledged 64 have not yet been closed due to legal problems , he added . The Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) has placed 14 banks in receivership in an attempt to stabilise the crumbling financial system . The BNB has sought bankruptcy for five of them through the courts , which so far have delayed ruling . The government , struggling to avoid default on $ 10 billion foreign debt payments , has offered for privatisation some 20 major state industrial enterprises hoping to raise around $ 1 billion in the next few months . " We will try to convince the IMF mission that all planned measures aimed at improving financial discipline . . . in the country have been fulfilled , " Videnov told the news conference on Tuesday .

OLYMPICS - IOC SAYS 16 OLYMPIANS RAISED DOPING SUSPICIONS . Sixteen athletes raised suspicions of doping at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but only two were named and punished , International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) medical chief Prince Alexandre de Merode said on Wednesday . Bulgarian women ' s triple jumper Iva Prandzheva and Russian women ' s high hurdler Natalya Shekodanova were both banned after testing positive for steroids at the Games . But De Merode told a news conference that two cases were " discussed and abandoned " , seven cases involving the drug Bromantan were rejected on " juridical grounds " and five positive urine samples were rejected because of technical doubts . Bromantan is a banned stimulant - cum - masking agent and an arbitration panel ruled at the time that there was some credence to suggestions that the athletes took the drug to boost their immune system , not their performance . However de Merode , an IOC vice - president , said that because of technical advances made since the Games he was confident that all 16 samples would fail dope tests if carried out under similar circumstances in a few months ' time . " If these 16 cases were to come up again in six months or a year I think they would be positive , " he told Reuters . IOC medical director Patrick Schamash said earlier this month that four Olympic athletes could face bans if the IOC decided to retest their urine samples from Atlanta . He said then that the four had failed for anabolic steroids but the IOC had not been satisfied about the reliability of the testing procedures conducted on a high - resolution mass spectrometer , used for the first time at an Olympics . De Merode said that there were in fact five cases and the IOC had decided that the samples would be used for research purposes and would not therefore be retested . " There were some products partially detected . These results were not considered positive given the technical difficulties which allowed some element of doubt , " he said . " The five cases are now closed . " Clearing up what he said were " wrong interpretations which led to the belief that four cases were hidden , " De Merode said that the mere fact that a laboratory detected an illegal substance did not constitute a doping case . " The case is investigated by the medical commission and then the commission decides whether it is a case of doping . " De Merode said that the five steroid cases were discussed at IOC executive commission level before the Games were over and there was " an agreement to consider these cases as part of research work into high - resolution " . The samples had been taken from Atlanta to an IOC laboratory in Barcelona where they had been opened and recoded . De Merode said some would be sent to a laboratory in Ferrara , Italy , and parts to researchers in Stockholm . The Ferrara laboratory is working on a new urine test for erythropoietin ( EPO ) , which stimulates the production of red blood cells which transport oxygen around the body - - a quick shot - in - the - arm which replaces high altitude training . The drug is suspected of having killed athletes in the past and is considered one of the most dangerous in sport . It is believed to be used in endurance events like cycling and rowing . De Merode said the Ferrara study , conducted by Professor Francesco Conconi , " looks like giving us a satisfactory solution " and the IOC hoped to be able to validate the method and various procedures involved very soon . " As I am an optimist , we hope that by the end of the first quarter of next year if all goes well the test could be working in a practical way , " De Merode said .

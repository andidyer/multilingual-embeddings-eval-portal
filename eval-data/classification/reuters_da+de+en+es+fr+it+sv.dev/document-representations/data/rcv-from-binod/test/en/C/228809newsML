Bankgesellschaft Berlin sees same 97 div . Bankgesellschaft Berlin , Germany ' s sixth largest bank , said on Monday that it expected to pay an unchanged dividend in 1996 and 1997 . Responding to enquiries , a spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the bank ' s incoming chief executive , Wolfgang Rupf , was correctly cited in a report as saying the bank planned a pay out of 1 . 10 marks per five mark share for 1996 and 1997 . Such a dividend would imply an 11 mark pay out per 50 mark share value , the same as in 1995 . She added that Rupf expected an operating profit before provisions of between 600 million and one billion marks in 1997 . The bank said last Friday that bad debt worries had forced it into setting aside 2 . 2 billion marks of provisions in 1996 . - - Bonn Newsroom + 49 228 260 97150

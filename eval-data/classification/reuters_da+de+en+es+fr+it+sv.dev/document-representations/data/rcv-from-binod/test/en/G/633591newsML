Mexico president ' s popularity holds steady - poll . President Ernesto Zedillo ' s overall approval rating has fallen slightly but those who do approve him support him more strongly , a newspaper pollster said Tuesday . Reforma newspaper published a survey showing that 52 percent of respondents approved of Zedillo , down from an all - time peak of 54 percent recorded in March but still way up on the ratings in the low thirties the president scored during the country ' s 1995 economic crisis . Disapproval of his government also fell slightly , to 37 percent from 39 percent in March . The remainder of respondents either did not reply or did not know . " Zedillo ' s popularity is more solid than a few months ago , " Rafael Gimenez , the head of Reforma ' s polling unit , told Reuters . The newspaper also published a figure showing that on a performance rating scale of one to 10 , Zedillo scored a record 6 . 5 , up from 6 . 2 he notched up in March . Asked about the apparent contradiction between a better mark out of 10 and a lower approval rating , Gimenez said : " Zedillo is gaining a stronger approval rating from those who like him although slightly fewer people overall approve of him . " " What has happened is that Zedillo has divided people ' s opinion more sharply " . Gimenez noted that Zedillo ' s support was now more or less back to the levels he scored when he won his August 1994 election victory . However , he said Reforma ' s surveys indicated that the president would not be able to transfer his level of approval into votes for his Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) in congressional elections next month . " Confidence in the government without ( Zedillo ) is low , " Gimenez said . Reforma ' s surveys had also found that Zedillo was especially unpopular in Mexico City , where residents disapproved of his government by a two - to - one margin . However , the president ' s popularity improved markedly outside the capital and was slightly stronger in northern Mexico than in the south , Gimenez added . The main reason for this was that inhabitants of the capital saw Zedillo as the head of the local government as well as the national government and blamed him for the city ' s problems , Gimenez added . Reforma ' s survey was carried out on 1 , 125 respondents in 31 states between May 23 - 30 . No margin of error was given . ( ( - - Michael Stott , Mexico City newsroom + 525 728 9551 ) )

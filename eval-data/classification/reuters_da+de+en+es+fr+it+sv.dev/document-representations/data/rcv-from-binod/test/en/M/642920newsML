Mexico peso ends weak , but 8 . 00 / dlr barrier holds . The Mexican peso lost ground against the dollar for the fourth day in a row on Friday , with a big player preventing the peso from crossing the psychological eight - per - dollar line , traders said . The peso ' s slip was put down largely to pre - weekend speculation . " Those that had to cover ( dollar ) shorts have done so , " a trader said , noting that there was no real demand for dollars . " Neither dollars nor clients have entered the market , but forex desks have been speculatively playing the market . " The benchmark 48 - hour peso and its 24 - hour stablemate closed 1 . 7 and 2 . 3 centavos weaker , respectively , at 7 . 9820 / 7 . 9850 and 7 . 9800 / 7 . 9830 per dollar . Dealers said the peso could have broken through pyschological resistance at eight - per - dollar , but a big player stepped in several times to sell dollars to bolster the peso . Other dealers said the peso shied away from the barrier due to a sharp turnaround in the U . S . 30 - year Treasury bond , which was up 40 / 32 in late trade to yield 6 . 78 percent . " U . S . markets are very strong , and obviously that helped us . Otherwise we ' d now be trading at eight to the dollar , " another trader said . The same - day peso had earlier closed 3 . 95 centavos weaker at 7 . 9670 / 7 . 9725 per dollar , lagging the market . Dealers said they saw the peso sliding further next week , and saw second resistance at 8 . 0500 per dollar . " ( The peso ) could remain under pressure , but it depends in part on ( Tuesday ' s ) primary Cetes auction , " a dealer said . ( ( - - Alexis Quiones , Mexico City newsroom + 525 728 - 9555 ) )

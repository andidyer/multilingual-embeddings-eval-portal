UK natgas firms again , good demand in May , next ye . UK spot natural gas prices continued to rise in several periods on Monday , with good interest seen for May , the gas year from October and next winter , traders and brokers said . The flexibility mechanism saw a system buy over the weekend , with prices of up to 15 . 5 pence a therm seen on Saturday , dealers said . This lent a stronger tone to the short - term market on Monday . " There are people scootering around trying to hoover up retro gas for Saturday , " said a trader . There was also good interest for the first days of May . There was a trade at 10 . 65 pence a therm for 1 , 2 , 6 and May 7 , and another trader reported receiving a bid of 10 . 70 pence for the first four days of May . The next major focus of interest was the gas year starting this October , which traded several times at both St Fergus and the NBP . Prices at the NBP were firmly above the psychologically important 13 . 00 pence a therm level , which had been seen as the upper limit for much of last week , and the first quarter 1998 was particularly strong . " We ' re now into a new market level " said a dealer , referring to Q1 . " We ' ve bust the 15 . 75 / 16 . 00 range , " he added , pointing out that this range had remained unchanged for several days until the end of last week . Although no Q1 trade was seen above 16 . 35 pence a therm , offers were said to be coming from 16 . 45 by the close . Another trader said that the strength in the gas year was mainly " on the back of one buyer " who emerged on Monday to buy significant volumes . While the OTC market was relatively busy , IPE futures were muted , as they often are on a Monday . Only 60 lots were done , all in May on the day before the contract expires , although prices were up across the board . But there were also Exchanges for Physical accounting for 310 lots in July , August and September . Transco announced that Tuesday ' s temperature is forecast at 11 . 3 Celsius , slightly above the seasonal normal 11 . 1 Celsius , and that demand is expected to be 203 mcm , 47 percent of peak day demand . - - Sebastian Alison , London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 6412

UN rights body concerned over German xenophobia . The United Nations human rights committee on Friday expressed concern about persistent xenophobia and anti - Semitism in Germany , as well as ill - treatment of foreigners and minorities by German police . The U . N . watchdog body also said it fully expected China to report back to it regularly on respect for political and civil rights in Hong Kong after the territory changes hands in July . The 18 independent experts accused Swiss police of mistreating detainees , especially foreigners , and chastised Danish police for using dogs in crowd control which sometimes resulted in bystanders being seriously injured . They oversee compliance with the 1976 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , a major human rights treaty . On Friday , the committee ended a three - week meeting during which experts also reviewed reports by Peru and Gabon . Their final written conclusions now go to the U . N . General Assembly . On Germany , the committee welcomed efforts made by the government to counter racism , anti - Semitism and xenophobia . But it said these problems persisted and recommended new efforts to educate youth and train police that racism and xenophobia violated basic human dignity and law . The experts expressed concern of instances of " illtreatment of persons by the ( German ) police , including foreigners and particularly members of ethnic minorities and asylum - seekers " . " It is concerned that there is no truly independent mechanism for investigating complaints of ill - treatment by the police . The committee therefore recommends the establishment of independent bodies throughout the territory of Germany for the investigation of complaints of ill - treatment by the police . " A summary of the report gave no specific examples . Helga Voelskow - Thies , director of German Federal Justice Ministry , told the committee on November 4 that the number of crimes with xenophobic background had decreased noticeably in 1995 . This was primarily due to persistent court attention . The experts also expressed concern over a German law allowing solitary confinement of up to 90 days . They said members of certain religious sects were effectively disqualified from employment in the public sector in some Laender . The practice may violate basic rights protected under the covenant . The experts requested that Britain submit a report on the human rights situation of Hong Kong up to June 30 , 1997 . This would serve as a yardstick against which China ' s record could be measured in the future , according to human rights sources . The committee urged Britain " to take all necessary steps to ensure effective and continued application of the provisions of the covenant in the territory of Hong Hong in accordance with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law " . Britain has signed the rights covenant , but China has not - - raising concerns about the rights of Hong Kong ' s six million citizens after Beijing regains sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 . Under their Joint Declaration of December 1984 , the two countries agreed that the treaty ' s provisions would continue to remain in force in Hong Kong after sovereignty is transferred . " We are confident that China will abide to the covenant by good faith , which is a basic principle of treaty law , " Francisco Aguilar - Urbina , a Costa Rican lawyer expert who chairs the body , told a final news conference . " We are very hopeful China will abide by its treaty obligations and report to the U . N . Human Rights Committee on Hong Kong , " he added . Aguilar - Urbina and the committee vice - chairman Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati , himself a former chief justice of the Indian Supreme Court , visited Hong Kong in October in part to examine how " reporting obligations " under the covenant could be continued for Hong Kong in the future . " The committee has had no contact with Chinese authorities regarding their eventual reporting obligations , " Aguilar said . Hong Kong legislators and non - governmental organisations came to Geneva last month to urge the committee to ensure some supervision of rights after the handover to Chinese rule . " We are quite pessimistic about the fate of human rights in Hong Kong after the transfer , " Emily Lau , a member of the colony ' s current Legislative Council , told a news briefing then .

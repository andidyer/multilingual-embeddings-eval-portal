French capital markets closing report . French bond futures and PIBOR contracts built on last week ' s strong gains , surprising many participants who had forecast some consolidation on Monday . Traders said positioning ahead of the expiry of the September bond future at 0900 GMT today was the initial driving force and calm returned to the market in the afternoon . German economic releases later in the week were now the main focus . The franc also extended its recent rally , creeping close to the 3 . 4037 per mark August 22 high , reached after the Bundesbank and the Bank of France both cut key interest rates . Traders said a break above 3 . 4040 could trigger a move to 3 . 40 . " We were waiting for some consolidation this morning , but it didn ' t happen . The trend is still bullish , " said a trader at a French brokerage . " We now expect this consolidation tomorrow . " Traders said there were few worries about the presentation of the French budget on Wednesday since the general substance of the measures had already been leaked . " We know already the way they get to three percent isn ' t very stylish - - the important thing is to get there , " one said . The government is expected to use cash from state bank Caisse des Depots and France Telecom to help reduce the budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product in 1997 . The December bond future settled up 22 basis points at 123 . 84 after failing to break through resistance at 123 . 90 . Traders said the next resistance points for the contract would be 124 . 00 , 124 . 10 and 124 . 24 . PIBOR climbed again with the December contract touching a new contract high at 96 . 19 . It settled just shy of the high at 96 . 18 , up five basis points . Traders said the relatively strong performance of the franc in recent days had raised speculation the Bank of France will allow call money to ease this week . Some said a move on Thursday morning , the day after the Budget presentation , was likely . Analysts said a lowering of call money could signal a subsequent move lower in the intervention rate soon . As expected , the Bank of France left its key rate unchanged at 3 . 35 percent at today ' s money market tender . The yield on the 6 . 50 percent 2006 OAT fell to 6 . 22 percent from 6 . 23 percent on Friday , bringing the spread over 10 - year Bunds to five from seven basis points . The yield on the 13 - week Treasury bills fell to 3 . 50 percent at auction on Monday from 3 . 67 percent last week . - - David Clarke , Paris Newsroom + 331 4221 5542

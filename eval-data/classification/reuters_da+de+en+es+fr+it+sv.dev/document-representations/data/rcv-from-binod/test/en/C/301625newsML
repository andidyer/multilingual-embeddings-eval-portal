RTRS - Colly Cotton to build W . Australia gin . Australian Stock Exchange - listed Colly Cotton Ltd has signed heads of agreement to build a new A $ 800 , 000 cotton gin in the north Western Australian town of Kununurra , Colly said in a statement . The investment is part of a research project in the Ord River Irrigation Area as it gears up for a return to full scale commercial cotton production , it said . The new gin is being built in a joint venture with the Ord River District Cooperative and will have capacity to process up to 6 , 000 bales of cotton a year , Colly said . Cotton growing in the Kimberleys ceased in the early 19070s when insect infestation over the summer months proved economically uncontrollable , it said . The region ' s potential to become a cotton producing region again had been enhanced through the development of a new strain of cotton which is grown in the dry season , the winter months . The new strain , commonly referred to as BT cotton , is genetically - engineered cotton which is more pest resistant than conventional strains and therefore less dependent on chemical insecticides . The new cotton was currently being subjected to agricultural and commercial viability trials , Colly said . Nick Gill , Colly ' s commercial manager , said one of the strongest attractions of the company ' s involvement in the Kimberleys was that the cotton season there complemented the cotton cycle in the eastern states . In New South Wales ( NSW ) and other eastern seabord states , cotton is planted in September and harvested in April , while in the Kimberleys planting commenced in March / April and is harvested in September . The Kimberleys project would enable Colly to market Australian cotton all year around , Gill said . The Ord River was an ideal cotton growing region because of its huge reserves of water and hot weather . " It should become commercially viable thanks to the research effort which has produced the new seasonally flexible insect tolerant cotton plant , " Gill said . In 1997 , subject to government approval , 200 hectares of BT cotton would be grown by the West Australian Department of Agriculture and three or four local farmers , Gill said . If trials proved successful , Colly would seek to build a larger gin in year 2000 . This would coincide with planned phase two development of the Ord Irrigation Area , which will bring on stream an additional 45 , 000 hectares of irrigation land , Gill also said . Colly is one of Australia ' s largest integrated cotton producer and marketer with more than 24 , 000 ha under crop in NSW and Queensland and responsibility for the marketing of about 20 percent of Australia ' s total cotton production . The company ' s coming harvest was expected to be the most valuable ever produced in Australia by a single owner , it said . - - Sydsnmey Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

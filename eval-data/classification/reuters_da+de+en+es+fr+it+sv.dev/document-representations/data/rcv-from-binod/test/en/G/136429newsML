Polish martial law authors will not be tried . Poland ' s left - dominated parliament on Wednesday decided that former communist military strongman Wojciech Jaruzelski should not be prosecuted for his 1981 declaration of martial law to crush the Solidarity union . Parliament , where two parties rooted in the pre - 1989 communist system hold a majority , voted 211 to 146 with 60 abstentions to abandon proceedings against General Jaruzelski over his clampdown on the Soviet bloc ' s first free trade union . If parliament ' s decision had gone the other way , Jaruzelski and several other top former communists would have faced trials in a special court for top officials , the State Tribunal . " I accept it ( the vote ) with satisfaction for understandable reasons , " Jaruzelski , 73 , told PAP news agency . He said he had been ready to face trial and was sure the court would have vindicated his views that martial law was necessary to avert the threat of a Soviet military invasion and end the economic crisis crippling Poland at the time . " To this day I regret the harm , suffering and indignities inflicted upon many people . . . but all things considered it ( martial law ) was the lesser evil , " he said . The martial law decree led to the arrest of thousands of opposition activists , sent tanks onto the streets and sparked a wave of labour unrest , crushed by riot police . During clashes at the Wujek colliery in southern Poland , police shot dead nine protesting miners . Opposition groups said Jaruzelski ' s trial would have been an act of historic and moral justice and would have showed that no politician could escape responsibility for his deeds . " The ex - communists managed to defend their former party colleague , " Andrzej Potocki , spokesman for the Union for Freedom party , told Reuters after the vote - - which also lets some other martial law leaders , including then interior minister General Czeslaw Kiszczak , off the hook . Lech Walesa - - Solidarity ' s founder , who spent nearly 12 months in jail under martial law - - commented : " No one will escape justice . History will judge them all . " Jozef Oleksy , leader the ruling ex - communist Democratic Left Alliance , hailed the decision , saying it would help Poland to bury its painful past and focus on the future . Advocates of Jaruzelski , who was briefly president after the 1989 fall of communism , have praised him for his contribution to the peaceful dismantling of the old communist system during talks with the opposition . The Jaruzelski case was opened five years ago when groups which had struggled to overthow communism were still in power . They reached no conclusion because subsequent parliaments were dissolved ahead of schedule . In 1993 , the ruling coalition of ex - communists and the Peasant party won elections , on a wave of discontent with pains associated with market reforms and further delayed the debate . Last year , Walesa failed to be re - elected president and former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski took over . Jaruzelski still faces trial in the port city of Gdansk over the shooting by security forces in 1970 of dozens of demonstrators during protests sparked by food price rises . He was defence minister at the time .

Mediaset aims to be second Italy phone operator . Mediaset aims to become Italy ' s second largest fixed line phone operator through its involvement in Albacom in which British Telecom and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro BNL also have stakes , Mediaset Managing Director Ubaldo Livolsi said . " In fixed line telephony we propose to become the second operator , we have a clear plan to be the second operator in importance after Telecom Italia , " Livolsi told Reuters in an interview . Livolsi made the remarks shortly after Mediaset announced a slight fall in net profit for 1996 from the previous year , reflecting a higher tax charge . Pretax profit rose sharply to 835 . 4 billion lire . Livolsi said the entry of France Telecom as a partner in Infostrada , a telecom venture established in 1995 with Olivetti and Bell Atlantic as main partners , did not pose an immediate threat to Albacom . " It ' s true that Infostrada is there but after the agreement with France Telecom they will need time to become operative . We are calmly convinced we can face up to the challenge , " he said . - - Milan newsroom + 392 - 66102321

Airline trade group reports lower ' 96 profits . The International Air Transport Asssociation ( IATA ) , an airline trade group , said on Wednesday that its member airlines reported net income of US $ 4 . 0 billion , a decrease from the record $ 5 . 2 billion reported in 1995 . The head of IATA said 1997 ' s prospects signaled a slight profit recovery , but he was cautious about the airline industry ' s capacity hurting passenger yields . Revenues increased to $ 134 . 3 billion in 1996 from $ 128 . 8 billion in 1995 , based on international scheduled service of the more than 250 member airlines , the trade group said . Pierre Jeanniot , director general of the group , said in a statement that traffic increased 6 . 9 percent in 1996 and capacity increased by 7 . 1 percent . Jeanniot made his comments yesterday at the 8th IATA Financial Management Conference in New York . " It now seems probably that average yields fell by 2 . 5 percent - - and thus fell even faster than unit cost , which recorded minus 1 . 0 percent , " Jeanniot said . Initial prospects for 1997 indicate a slight profit recovery at $ 4 . 4 billion , the trade group said . In a text of his speech , Jeanniot said airlines are increasing capacity and placed record orders for new aircraft , which will be debt financed . Jeanniot said economic stability and increased market opportunity has encouraged this trend . He questioned whether or not airlines could take on more debt while generating " mediocre net profitability . " Jeannoit said airlines might be better served by modernizing rather than expanding their fleets . " It is easy to buy airplanes . It is harder , but perhaps smarter , not to buy airplanes , " he said .

Euro bourses fall as investors pocket profits . European stocks slipped from recent record levels on Wednesday as a mixed overnight session on Wall Street encouraged investors to pocket profits . On currency markets , the dollar strengthened with talk of a U . S . interest rate increase getting louder and dealers awaiting the release of the U . S . central bank ' s Beige Book assessment of the state of the country ' s economy . The lacklustre performance on equity markets followed an unsettled day yesterday when European shares backtracked after roaring to new record trading highs in early business . London was the least affected by the downturn in European sentiment . The FTSE index slid only a few points after closing at new peaks for the previous six sessions . " A bit of profit - taking is too be expected . But I can ' t see any major sell - off today , " one senior dealer said . " After an initial mark - down the FTSE will probably just mess around in a tight range and wait for Wall Street . " On Tuesday , the Dow closed 5 . 77 points up to a record level of 7 , 085 . 16 . " Wall Street didn ' t do much so there is no reason to rush in and start buying . The Dow is probably going to head lower today so that will encourage a bit of profit - taking here , " one trader said . Though the Dow edged to a record for a second session , the overall market was nervous because of speculation that the Federal Reserve might be planning an interest rate hike . Investors were worried about Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s warnings recently that stocks could be overvalued and that the central bank might raise short - term interest rates . In Paris , stocks fell nearly 0 . 8 percent in thin volumes , depressed by worries about long - term interest rate trends that fuelled profit - taking , traders said . " A lot of analysts are unclear where the market ' s going from here , " said Olivier Blitz at IFF Bourse . He said the bourse ' s underlying upward trend looked intact , particularly if the futures contract held above 2 , 670 points . If it broke that level , he said , a significant correction might take place . Against the trend , shares in Lafarge rose 1 . 63 percent to 373 . 50 francs ( $ 64 . 83 ) after the group reported net attributable profit of 1 . 85 billion francs , which was well received by the market . Lafarge also said it expected 1997 sales to rise more than 10 percent . In Frankfurt , German shares weakened as chemicals group Hoechst AG fell 3 . 25 marks , more than four percent , to 71 . 95 after it shelved plans to list its HMR Marion Roussel unit . " But apart from that , it ' s relatively steady , although what is worrying at the moment is that there are no impulses to be seen on the upside , " said one dealer . He added that trading volumes , which had been reasonable on Tuesday , were now relatively low and that there was little in the way of scheduled news to look out for . In currencies , the dollar climbed by a yen and half a pfennig on the strength of speculation about higher U . S . interest rates as dealers awaited the Beige Book report at 1900 GMT . Talk that the Federal Reserve central bank might increase rates at its policy - making Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting on March 25 has ebbed and flowed since the release of February U . S . employment data on Friday . While brisk job growth is still evident , it has not yet been mirrored by any signs of wage inflation , analysts said . " The market ' s getting a little nervous about this month ' s FOMC and that should continue to prove dollar supportive as speculation about a rate rise circulates , " said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy .

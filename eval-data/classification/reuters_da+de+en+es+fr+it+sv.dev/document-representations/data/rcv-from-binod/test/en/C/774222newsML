FOCUS - Lloyds TSB shares fly as returns soar . Shares in Britain ' s most profitable bank Lloyds TSB Group Plc rose sharply on Friday as it reported a massively improved return based on lower costs and higher incomeand some analysts predicted an upgrading of full - year forecasts . Lloyds TSB ' s pre - tax profit figure was within expectations at just over 1 . 5 billion pounds ( $ 2 . 5 billion ) in the first half of the year , but its dividend was higher than most in the market had expected 5 . 3 pence per share against 4 . 2p a year ago . The bank ' s shares performed strongly on the back of the data rising to a high of 707p before settling 28p higher at 703 . 5p by midmorning . Lloyds shares had already improved by well over 100 percent from their low point in the last year . " They are a very strong set of figures , " said BZW banking analyst Tim Sykes . " There was a fantastic performance on mortgages , interest margin and a wonderful return on equity . " Lloyds TSB ' s return on equity figure , already very high at 34 . 8 percent at the end of last year , jumped again to 40 . 4 percent . " Underneath all the adjustments , the results are very solid , " said John Leonard , banking analyst at Salomon Brothers . " I expected a good performance on costs but not quite this good . " Lloyds saw its cost to income ratio drop significantly to 51 . 7 percent from 57 . 7 percent as internal cost controls and the benefits of its merger with TSB began to come through . It said it still expects the latter to be at least 400 million pounds a year by 1999 . A rise in total income to 3 . 59 billion pounds , or seven percent , came despite a further 50 million pounds provision against payments the bank may have to make to customers who were mis - sold pensions . Its total provision for this now stands at 250 million pounds . On an economic profit basis - - the difference between the earnings on the equity of a business and its cost - - the results were even more positive , rising 75 percent to 816 million pounds . Lloyds saw good growth in its core retail banking operation , with personal loans and credit card lending growing by 13 percent and profit from mortgages up by 18 percent . Lloyds said it will begin to sell its C & G mortgage brand through TSB branches as well as through branches of Lloyds in the second half of 1997 . Analysts say that Lloyds shares are expensive by almost all conventional measures , but the bank ' s sustainable and high quality income stream means most are still buyers of the stock . Nick Collier , banking analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter forecast an upgrading of full - year forecasts on the back of Friday ' s numbers . Lloyds TSB is currently forecast to make a pre - tax profit of over 3 . 1 billion pounds for thew full year . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8864 . ( $ = 0 . 610 British Pounds )

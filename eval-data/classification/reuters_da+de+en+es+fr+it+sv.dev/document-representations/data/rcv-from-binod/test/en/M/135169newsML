Indonesia rupiah firms , swaps fall in late trading . The Indonesian rupiah firmed against the dollar in sleepy late trading on Tuesday but swaps trading was active , dealers said . " It ' s a sleepy day . The rate has moved in a narrow range of 30 cents since the morning , " one U . S . bank dealer said . " There is no fresh factor . Overall sentiment on the rupiah remains bullish , " the dealer said . Spot rupiah was quoted at 2 , 324 . 25 / 24 . 50 at 0845 GMT against an opening of 2 , 324 . 25 / 24 . 50 . Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2 , 323 . 80 / 23 . 90 and 2 , 323 . 00 / 23 . 25 , respectively . Dealers said , however , the relatively active swap market had helped provide some life . One dealer said overnight money fell to 10 . 0 / 11 . 0 percent late in the afternoon from 16 percent at the opening . He said short - dated swaps also declined on expectation of an easing in money market conditions following fresh inflows of civil servants ' salaries transferred by the government . He said state banks were seen unloading short - term swaps which might indicate the beginning of fresh transfers . Overnight swap was at 0 . 65 / 0 . 70 . Tom / next swap declined to 0 . 46 / 0 . 47 points from 0 . 57 / 0 . 60 points . Another reason was the expectation of some fresh rupiah supply following central bank ' s dollar buying on Monday . One state bank dealer said Bank Indonesia was estimated to have absorbed about $ 200 million from the market after the spot rate fell out of the band . Dealers said the amount sold to the central bank was not significant because of a relative lack of trading activity . The U . S . bank dealer said declines in short - term swaps had helped drag down longer - term swap premiums . " Sentiment on longer - term swaps was bearish . Some players seemed to anticipate narrowing interest rate differentials between the two currencies , " the dealer said . He said they were expecting possible higher U . S . interest rates in the short - term while more downside was anticipated for the rupiah , narrowing the differential . One - month swap was quoted at 17 . 3 / 17 . 75 , two at 32 . 5 / 33 . 25 , three at 49 . 50 / 50 . 25 and six at 98 . 0 / 98 . 75 points . One foreign bank dealer said operators were uncertain over the short - term trend because they could not push the dollar further down due to the central bank floor rate for dollars . However , there was no incentive to buy dollars , keeping the market hovering around the band in lethargic trade , he said . He said a firm stand by the central bank to defend the band seemed to have discouraged further speculation for now . The central bank kept its intervention rate unchanged at 2 , 324 / 2 , 516 and the conversion rate at 2 , 324 / 2 , 372 on Tuesday . - - Jakarta newsroom + 6221 384 - 6364

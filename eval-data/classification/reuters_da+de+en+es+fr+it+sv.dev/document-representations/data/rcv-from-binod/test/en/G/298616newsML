BULGARIA TROOPS ESCORT DEPUTIES FROM BESIEGED PARLT . Bulgarian interior ministry troops on Saturday began escorting deputies from the ruling Socialist party out of parliament , which is surrounded by opposition supporters . Deputies of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces remained inside . They have sworn to stay until their demand for a general election is met . Socialist deputies had been sleeping in offices and corridors in their part of the building , to the left of the entrance . Protesters attacked the parliament building on Friday during debate on a motion calling for early elections , as anger at Bulgaria ' s crisis spilled over into the worst political violence since the overthrow of one - party rule in 1989 . Dozens of demonstrators forced their way into the building . Police fought them back , spraying them with tear gas and water and barricading the corridors with tables and chairs . Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev said he would not ask the ex - communist ruling party to form a new government on Saturday as expected because of the protests .

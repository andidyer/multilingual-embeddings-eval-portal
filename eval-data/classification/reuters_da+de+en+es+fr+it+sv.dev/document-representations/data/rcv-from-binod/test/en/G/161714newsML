ROMANIA PRESIDENTIAL , PARLIAMENTARY POLL GUIDE . Romania votes on Sunday in its third post - communist presidential and parliamentary elections , which will determine the pace of much - needed economic reform . Here are some key facts and figures on the election . More than 17 million Romanians aged 18 and above are voting for a new president , 341 seats in the lower Chamber of Deputies and 143 seats in the upper house , the Senate . All winners receive four - year mandates . If no presidential candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote , as seems likely , the two best - placed contenders will meet in a run - off election on November 17 . Polling stations will open from 6 a . m . ( 0400 GMT ) to 9 p . m . ( 1900 GMT ) , but voting can be extended until midnight ( 2200 GMT ) by the organiser , the Central Electoral Bureau ( BEC ) , if it feels more time is needed . The independent polling institute IRSOP says it will announce the results of a comprehensive exit poll on state television minutes after polls close . But the BEC , which has limited resources to combat Romania ' s poor communications , says it is unlikely to be able to collate the returns of 43 regional centres and announce official results until late on Monday . There are 16 candidates for the presidency , including incumbent Ion Iliescu who won elections in 1990 and 1992 and has held power since the overthrow and execution of Stalinist dictator Nicoale Ceausescu in December 1989 . Emil Constantinescu of the opposition Democratic Convention ( CDR ) bloc is Iliescu ' s main rival . Ex - prime minister Petre Roman of the Social Democratic Union ( USD ) is running third . Thousands of candidates from 27 parties , five alliances and 34 ethnic associations representing 18 ethnic minorities living in Romania , are fighting for seats in the country ' s legislative assemblies . The threshold for parties to enter parliament is three percent . Leftover votes are re - distributed to the parties who have won a place in parliament , which must reconvene by November 23 . Iliescu ' s Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) , descendents of pre - 1989 ruling communists , are running second to the CDR in the opinion polls and may lose their grip on power . Romania is the only eastern European country where the anti - communist opposition has not yet had a spell in office . But ushering in such a government will depend on tough coalition bargaining . Five local watchdog groups are fielding 13 , 490 local observers to watch the 15 , 177 polling stations across Romania , amid accusations from all sides of dirty tricks . International observers are also being accredited . The leading opposition parties - - the CDR , Roman ' s USD and the National Liberal Alliance - - have set up a parallel counting network across the country and will also report preliminary results .

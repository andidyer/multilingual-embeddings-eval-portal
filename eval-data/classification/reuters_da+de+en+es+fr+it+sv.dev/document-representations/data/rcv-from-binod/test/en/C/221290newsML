KLM rejigs route network . Dutch carrier KLM said on Wednesday it had started rejigging its route network as part of its previously - announced Focus 2000 programme to cut costs and boost revenues . New services to be introduced under the summer schedule starting next April 1 include a twice - weekly service to Abidjan , capital of the Ivory Coast , and a twice - weekly service to Nagoya , Japan via Sapporo , KLM said . The Nagoya service was subject to Russian authorisation for flights across Siberia , it said . KLM said it would also increase the frequency of services to Atlanta , Detroit and Los Angeles and to Montreal , Vancouver and Toronto . It said capacity for these routes would be taken from its less profitable services to Colombo , Sri Lanka , Conakry in Guinea and Khartoum in Sudan , which would be scrapped . Services to Surabaya and Denpasar in Indonesia , and Dhaka in Bangladesh will also be withdrawn , KLM said . KLM ' s wholly - owned regional subsidiary KLM CityHopper would be used more on European routes , stepping up the frequency of flights to Basle - Mulhouse , Bristol , Malmo and Southampton . Cityhopper capacity would be diverted from the Eindhoven to Heathrow and Eindhoven to Paris Charles de Gaulle services , to be taken over by KLM partner Air Exel Commuter , KLM said . KLM said at the presentation of first - half results in November it would seek to cut costs by transferring low - profit routes to cheaper partner airlines . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000 , Fax + 31 20 504 5040

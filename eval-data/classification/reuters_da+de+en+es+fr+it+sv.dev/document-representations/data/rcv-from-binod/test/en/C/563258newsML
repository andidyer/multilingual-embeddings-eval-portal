Sigma - Aldrich stepping up acquisition pace . Sigma - Aldrich Corp said Tuesday the company will make an increasing number of acquisitions in the coming years and will spend $ 20 million on a company - wide data processing system . Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting , chief executive Tom Cori declined to specify the exact number of acquisitions to be made , but he said the rate would increase from previous years . He said the company typically acquires one metal business a year and one chemical business every three years . " We are going to continue to make acquisitions - - some will be bolt - ons ( to existing businesses ) and some will be add - ons ( new areas of business ) , " Cori said . Sigma - Aldrich also intends to partner with other companies throughout the world to increase its product lines . " Our goal is to reach $ 2 billion in sales , " Cori said . The company passed the $ 1 billion mark in 1996 for the first time , with sales increasing 7 . 8 percent to $ 1 . 03 billion and net income growing by 12 . 3 percent to $ 147 . 86 million . Sigma - Aldrich plans to install a $ 20 million unified data processing system for all of its worldwide operations in the next few years , Cori said . " Without this system , it makes it very hard for people to communicate , " he told Reuters after the meeting . A shareholder proposal from the founder and former chief executive of Sigma - Aldrich , Alfred Bader , to cut officers ' salaries in proportion to any significant fines levied against the company was defeated . In July 1996 , Sigma - Aldrich agreed to pay a $ 480 , 000 fine to settle a dispute with the U . S . Bureau of Export Administration over 48 counts of exporting toxins to 17 countries without export licenses . ( ( - - Chicago newsdesk , 312 - 408 - 8787 ) )

Plains feedlot cattle sales near midday Thursday were inactive as the industry wound down ahead of Friday ' s Independence Day holiday , feedlot sources said . Major U . S . beef packing plants will be closed in observance of the holiday but will resume normal operations on Saturday and Monday , company officials and market sources said .

Sales this week kept most feedlots fairly current , but there will be some carryover of cattle into next week ' s showlists , cattle sources said . Fed cattle prices next week could be pressured by increased cattle supplies and outlooks for a seasonal decline in beef demand following the three - day holiday weekend , several feedlot sources said . " It ' s going to be tough to hold on to $ 63 . 00 next week , " one Panhandle feedlot manager said . ( ( Bob Janis 312 - 048 - 8720 ) )

Japan trade gap may be set to rise after long drop . Japan ' s contentious trade surplus may be heading for its first monthly rise in almost two years , but analysts are divided on whether this would signal a major shift in the trend of a shrinking trade gap . Preliminary trade figures for the first 20 days of October , released on Wednesday , showed a strong surge in the surplus compared with the same month a year earlier , opening up the real possibility of a rise for the month as a whole . This would be the first such increase in the trade surplus - - traditionally a source of friction with key trading partners like the United States - - in 23 months . Japan ' s customs - cleared trade surplus for the first 20 days of October surged 22 percent from the same period a year earlier to 231 . 15 billion yen ( $ 2 . 02 billion ) , the Finance Ministry said . This was the first rise for this 20 - day time - frame since August 1995 . " It ' s highly possible that the trade surplus for the month of October may post an increase , " said Yasuyuki Komaki , economist at NLI Research Institute . Japan ' s trade surplus has been steadily declining since November 1994 , helped by the sharp rise of the yen against the dollar as this tends to boost imports and restrain exports . The dollar hit an all - time low of 79 . 75 yen in April 1995 . Now the dollar is trading at around 114 to 115 yen . Economists have said before now that a rapid weakening of the yen since the beginning of this year would eventually put the brakes on the fall in the surplus . Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Wednesday the decline in Japan ' s net exports is expected to taper off due to the weaker yen . But the strong rise in the surplus for early October is also due to one - off factors - - unusually low exports last October and a typhoon this autumn that skewed export flows - - that suggest it may be just a blip . The typhoon , which struck Japan in late September , increased exports in early October , Komaki said . The pace of decline in the trade surplus reached its peak in the summer , and the trend is now for minimal increases in Japan ' s net exports , Komaki said . Kenichiro Futagami , an economist at Daiwa Bank , agreed that Japan ' s trade surplus was likely to increase for the month of October , adding that exports generally tend to increase toward the end of the month . But Futagami was more cautious about calling the October increase a sign that the overall decline was grinding to a halt . " I don ' t see it ( the October increase ) as a new trend where the decline in the surplus is over and Japan ' s trade surplus is heading for an increase , " Futagami said . A Finance Ministry official said the rise was partly in response to an unusually big gap between exports and imports in October 1995 , adding : " The actual trade balance is close to the recent trend . " The trade surplus for the first 20 days of October 1995 showed a hefty year - on - year decline of 57 . 6 percent , and the surplus for the entire month of October 1995 plunged more than 40 percent from a year earlier to $ 5 . 33 billion , with one major factor being a sharp drop in car exports in that month . The official was cautious about forecasting the trade balance for the full month , noting that figures can easily get skewed in the first half of the month . Japan ' s customs - cleared trade surplus in September fell 30 . 3 percent from a year earlier to 779 . 52 billion yen ( $ 6 . 83 billion ) . ( $ 1 = 114 yen )

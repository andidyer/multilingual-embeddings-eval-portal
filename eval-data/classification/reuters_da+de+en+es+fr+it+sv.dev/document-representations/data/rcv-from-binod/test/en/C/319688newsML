Telefonica says rising share price not a problem . The finance director of Telefonica said on Monday he was not worried by the group ' s share value even though it has surged above what he called a reasonable price for the sale of Spain ' s remaining 20 . 94 percent stake . The sale was launched on Monday and in response Telefonica stock climbed another 70 pesetas , or 2 . 10 percent , to 3 , 420 pesetas ( $ 25 . 20 ) . Last year , it rose 80 percent and now costs more than double what it did during the last stake sale in 1995 . " The range of 3 , 300 to 3 , 400 ( pesetas ) , would be reasonable to manage , " Finance Director Alfonso Pajuelo said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television . " So 3 , 300 would be a possible share price . " But he added that the telecommunications group was not worried about the share price at the moment . " We don ' t see that the actual price of the issue will give us any special concern , " Pajuelo said . The share price is already above the range of forecasts for the final price of the shares according to a Reuter poll of analysts conducted last week . They forecast a price in the range of 3 , 200 to 3 , 400 , with the 12 - month target at about 3 , 600 . On Friday , Telefonica said it would privatise the remaining 20 . 94 percent state stake and that the offering size would be 171 million shares . ( $ 1 = 135 . 7 Peseta )

US trade deficit rise disappoints Commerce ' s Daley . Commerce Secretary William Daley voiced concern on Friday about the widening U . S . trade deficit so far this year , but nevertheless argued that the country ' s exports remain very competitive on world markets . " While I am disappointed that the overall trade deficit has widened so far this year , there are quite a few positive things to say about trade developemnts in 1997 , " Daley told a news conference . The Commerce Department reported earlier that the U . S . trade deficit widened to $ 48 . 09 billion in the first five months of this year , from $ 44 . 19 billion in the same year - earlier period . The U . S . trade deficit in May soared by 17 . 0 percent to $ 10 . 23 billion . Daley said the trade gap had been boosted by adverse movements in the prices of both energy and food . The rise in energy prices year - on - year boosted the value of U . S . imports . The drop in grain and other prices reduced U . S . exports . Falling prices for wheat and corn have lowered exports , Daley said . " So far this year we have enjoyed strengthening trade balances in both manufacturing and services trade but adverse price trends have worsened trade balances in both food and energy trade , " he said . The strength of the U . S . economy has also had an impact on the trade account , by attracting imports . Daley said he expects the U . S . economy to stay strong for the near future . However , the Commerce chief also saw signs that the economies of many of America ' s trading partners are picking up , strengthening demand for U . S . exports . " Our trade with Canada , our largest trading partner , is doing quite nicely , " Daley said . " We anticipate substantial further gains in trade with Canada . " U . S . trade with Mexico is " booming , " Daley added . However , he voiced concern about the U . S . trade performance with China . " China ' s market is too closed to our exports and we must make every effort to open that market to U . S . goods and services , " he said . " I plan to visit China in the fall to help boost U . S . exports to that market , " he added . The U . S . trade deficit with China widened by 9 . 1 percent in May , surpassing the bilateral gap with Japan . Daley said that the trend in the U . S . deficit with China was more worrying than that with Japan . While U . S . exports to Japan have sagged this year because of that country ' s weak domestic demand , U . S . imports from Japan have risen at a " significantly slower " rate than overall U . S . imports , Daley said . He also voiced optimism that Japan ' s step to boost its economy through deregulation will bear fruit . ( ( - - Washington Newsroom 202 898 - 8300 ) )

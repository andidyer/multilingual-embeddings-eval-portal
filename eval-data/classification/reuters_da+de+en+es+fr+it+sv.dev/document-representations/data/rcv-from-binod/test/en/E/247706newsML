RTRS - Australian business confidence firm - survey . Australian business confidence remained firm and the outlook for profits continued to be positive in the December quarter , according to survey released on Tuesday . The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( ACCI ) and Westpac Banking Corp survey found confidence remained high even though predictions of a seasonal upturn in new orders and output were not realised in the quarter . " Business expectations in the December quarter continue to favour an improvement in conditions over the next six months , " ACCI chief executive Mark Paterson said in a statement . " Except for immediately after the March 2 federal election nine months ago , business confidence has remained higher than at any time during 1995 and 1996 , " Paterson said . The number of manufacturers predicting an improvement in the general business situation in the next six months rose to 30 percent from 24 percent in the September quarter . Manufacturing activity continued to ease , but the outlook for profits remained steady with 51 percent of the manufacturers surveyed expecting higher profits in the next 12 months . In the September quarter , 47 percent of the manufacturers surveyed expected higher profits . Employment and overtime worked continued to fall at a similar pace to the past year , while capacity utilisation also remained at low levels . Increases in new orders and output were again forecast for the first quarter of 1997 , but a further deterioration in employment levels was also expected . " Inflationary pressures were well under control , " Paterson said . " Contrary to expectations , average selling prices continued to decline and there are no expectations for price rises in the March quarter 1997 . " - - Canberra Bureau 61 - 6 273 - 2730

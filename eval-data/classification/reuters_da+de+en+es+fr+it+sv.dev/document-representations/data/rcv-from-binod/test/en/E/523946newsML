AFRICA SEEKS DEBT RELIEF TO FUEL FLICKERING UPTURN . It may not mean much to the continent ' s millions of shack - dwellers , but Africa has just posted two successive years of growth and could do even better in 1997 . Half of the 48 sub - Saharan nations grew at least five percent in the past two years , and the World Bank forecasts overall African growth of 3 . 8 percent a year over the next decade . Sceptics point to a boom in commodity prices that may not last , and good rains , for the improved performance . But more and more African countries are starting to reap the benefits of free - market reforms after the lost decade of the 1980s - - when per capita income fell by over one percent a year . African states - - with varying degrees of enthusiasm - - are adopting the policies demanded by international investors and the Bretton Woods institutions . Now it is payback time , according to African leaders . Privatisation , trade liberalisation and scrapping capital restrictions may breath some life into decrepit economies , but the world ' s poorest continent is likely to remain just that unless it receives relief from its crippling debts . A new move on multilateral debt relief , due to be discussed at the twice - yearly meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank in Washington from April 23 to 29 , offers a glimmer of hope . The Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) scheme was agreed in principle by the IMF , World Bank and Paris Club of creditor nations last year , but it is taking longer to implement than originally hoped . The IMF and the World Bank last month approved a debt relief plan for Uganda , the first candidate . But the timetable has yet to be agreed with some countries wanting completion very soon , but others , including the United States , recommending that it take place only in April 1999 . British charity Oxfam says delays will have a huge social cost in Uganda - - paid in lives - - and is lobbying for a completion date to be set at this month ' s Washington meeting . When implemented , the initiative could reduce Uganda ' s $ 3 . 4 billion external debt , most inherited from the regimes of Idi Amin and Milton Obote , by about $ 385 million . Uganda is a test case for other HIPC states - - most of them in Africa - - with unsustainable debt . Ivory Coast , Burkina Faso and Bolivia are other immediate candidates for the plan . Later , the World Bank says , it would look at Ethiopia , Mozambique , Mali , Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome . Servicing Africa ' s international debt of about $ 340 billion chews up $ 24 billion annually - - money that the poorest states can ill afford . " Debt relief can free up hard currency for economic development - - that is why it is so important , ' ' said Hania Farhan , Africa economist at ING Barings in Johannesburg . Candidates for HIPC relief will need , in general , to have a six - year record under IMF tutorship that shows strong economic reform efforts , although this may vary from case to case . The rules promise to be tough - - too tough , according to African finance ministers who met in Addis Ababa earlier this month . While 33 of 41 the HIPC countries were in Africa , the rigidity of criteria meant few would benefit , they said . The new debt relief plan , when it comes , may help those states which have toed the IMF line . But across the continent , the economic picture is likely to remain patchy , as ever held hostage to politics . South Africa ' s peaceful transition has underpinned stability in the southern cone and a planned a 12 - nation free trade zone could spread its know - how and capital throughout the region . At the same time Angola has just sworn in a a national unity government after two decades of civil war , and reforms are boosting living standards in Malawi and Mozambique . In West Africa , the CFA franc zone has seen a recovery following the devaluation in 1994 , as has Ghana , an early convert to IMF reforms . But Nigeria remains a disappointment . At the heart of the continent , the picture looks bleak as Zaire is dismembered . But there may be a silver lining even here . International investors are beating a path to the door of rebel leader Laurent Kabila , banking on the fact that things can only get better after the Mobutu Sese Seko era .

FOCUS - Chubb considers sale of units . Chubb Corp said it was considering a possible sale or spin - off of its underperforming life insurance and real estate busineses , which have a combined book value of more than $ 1 . 2 billion . Chubb ' s plans , which were disclosed in a private conference call with analysts late Thursday , drove the stock up 12 percent to 50 - 7 / 8 on Friday . In a tape of the conference call that was later made available , Chubb chief executive Dean O ' Hare said the additional commitment needed to make the mid - sized life insurance business competitive with its larger rivals " may not be in the best interests of shareholders . " Chubb , based in Warren , N . J . , earns about 22 percent of its annual revenue from the life insurance and real estate operations . But those businesses have been poor performers for Chubb and have been dragging down the results of its main commercial and personal property - casualty insurance businesses . " I am fully aware that the life and real estate businesses are not earning satisfactory returns given the capital we have committed to them , " O ' Hare said . " Candidly , my patience with these underperforming assets has grown short . Therefore , we are again reevaluating our strategic alternatives for life and real estate , including a possible sale or spin off of these businesses as appropriate , " he said . A decision on Chubb ' s strategy could come by the end of the year , O ' Hare said . Proceeds could be used to buy back stock , make an acquisition to gain entry in an international market or expand its other businesses , he said . The life insurance business , which has a book value of $ 842 million , is currently generating only a single digit rate of return on equity for Chubb . " Life insurance never really worked for Chubb , " said Leandro Galban Jr . , a managing director in investment banking at Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette . " They ' re so good at so many other things , but it ' s never been a front runner for them , " he said . " It ' s not a bad company , it ' s simply a question of commitment . " But , the business is likely to be attractive to a number of larger life insurers with a greater focus on the industry . " I think it will probably attract a pretty large cast of buyers , " an industry source said . Companies that might have an interest in the life insurance business include General Electric Co ' s GE Capital , American General Corp , Conseco Inc and Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV , industry sources said . GE Capital , Conseco and American General declined comment . Internationale Nederlanden Groep was not immediately available for comment . Meanwhile , a recent strengthening in the market for office properties has encouraged Chubb to consider a sale of its real estate business , which has a book value of about $ 426 million , O ' Hare said . " As a result of this strengthening , we see a greater potential to sell some or all of these properties at reasonable returns , " O ' Hare said . He said he would consider private sales of the properties or a possible spin - off of them into a real estate investment trust . " I think it ' s an excellent move on their part , " Morgan Stanley analyst Alan Zimmermann said . " The life and real estate businesses have been a drag on the company ' s earnings and return on equity for years , " he said .

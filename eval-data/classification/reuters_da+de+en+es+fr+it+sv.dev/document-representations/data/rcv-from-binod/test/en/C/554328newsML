Shell ' s caution fails to depress analysts . Shell ' s downbeat comments on oil prices and refining margins failed to trigger gloom - mongering among analysts , who were braced for the oil giant ' s customary caution on its outlook . If anything , Shell ' s warning of potentially lower oil prices shows the group ' s prospects are better than many of its rivals , several industry watchers said . Competitors such as British Petroleum are far more geared towards oil production than Shell and are therefore more vulnerable to lower crude prices , they argue . This also explains why Shell ' s shares have been doing better than BP ' s since oil prices started to fall early this year , these analysts said . Shell Transport and Trading Co Plc outperformed BP by over six percent since the start of the year , Reuters share data show . " We share Shell ' s caution , but if you look at Shell ' s position they will do better than their peers if the oil price falls further , " said one leading analyst who declined to be named . Meanwhile , shares in Shell Transport and Trading were down 7 - 1 / 2 pence at 1 , 082 - 1 / 2 , but analysts dismissed this as a mere knee - jerk reaction . " The main reason behind the weakness in the share price is because Shell is cautious on the oil price , " said Kleinwort Benson analyst Paul Spedding . " But Shell has been cautious on the oil price ever since it was formed , " he added , echoing a widely held view . Another reason not to be alarmed by Shell ' s comments was that many analysts and investors were already expecting continuing pressure on crude oil prices , Spedding said . Shell earlier reported that first - quarter earnings excluding special items rose by one percent to 1 . 535 billion stg , which roughly met analysts ' average expectations . The flat results came after U . S . oil companies last month reported solid earnings increases . But this does not mean Shell is doing badly in comparison , most analysts said . They pointed at several one - off factors such as an unusually low tax rate and exceptionally cold winter weather in Europe that boosted results in 1996 ' s first quarter . " The reason we didn ' t think Shell ' s results would be higher in conjunction with U . S . oil companies was because of the effect of the weather and because the first quarter of last year was exceptionally good , " said Nick Antill at BZW . - - Hans de Jongh , London newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

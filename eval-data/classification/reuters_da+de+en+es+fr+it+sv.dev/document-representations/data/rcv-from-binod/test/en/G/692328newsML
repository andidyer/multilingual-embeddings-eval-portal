Albright says U . S . interests dictated HK decision . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday brushed aside controversy over a U . S . decision to soften its stand on Hong Kong ' s new Beijing backed - legislature . Albright told a news conference in Hanoi that a U . S . decision to be represented next week at the swearing - in of Hong Kong ' s new Beijing - picked provisional legislature did not detract from her earlier announcement to boycott the event . " I believe my being present at the reversion ceremony , but not being present for the swearing - in of the Legislative Council , is a significant political act , and one which I think carries a fairly important message , " she said . However , she dodged answering a question about the impact of the decision for Hong Kong democrats , who earlier this week accused both the United States and Britain of betrayal for softening their stance over the new , unelected body . Emily Lau , an oustpoken champion of democracy and member of the existing council , condemned Washington and London over the decision as " digusting and contemptible " . Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair will attend ceremonies surrounding the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty next week , but both said they would stay away from the legislature swearing - in . The new body was handpicked by Beijing and will be installed on July 1 in place of the existing democratically elected legislature . Washington and London later decided they would send their top Hong Kong envoys to the swearing - in . Albright defended that decision and said the United States had significant commercial and other interests in Hong Kong , meaning it was necessary to maintain a working - level contact with the colony ' s post - handover administration . " We have large numbers of ship visits . There are American citizens and businesses that are in Hong Kong , and it will be important to carry on business with the authorities in Hong Kong , " she said . But her comments were unlikely to encourage those in Hong Kong seeking international support for democractic rights in the territory after July 1 , when Beijing rule resumes . Democratic Party leader Martin Lee said earlier this week the original message that Britain and the United States would not accept the legitimacy of the new chamber had been " much watered down , if not contradicted " . Albright was expected in Hong Kong late on Saturday , earlier than originally planned , after cancelling a scheduled visit to Cambodia because of security concerns . From Hanoi she planned to go to Ho Chi Minh City , formerly Saigon , late on Friday for an extended stay that includes officiating at a ceremony to mark the start of work on a U . S . consulate in the southern city . She will also meet Vietnam ' s Communist Party chief Do Muoi . The United States and other leaders of the world ' s rich industrial nations plus Russia , at their summit last weekend in Denver , Colorado , urged China to respect Hong Kong ' s vibrant democracy and economy when it retakes control . The initial reaction to the Chinese troop deployment was that it was not surprising . " They ' ve always said they were going to put Chinese troops where the British troops were . That ' s not anything unusual . It ' s their territory , " the official said .

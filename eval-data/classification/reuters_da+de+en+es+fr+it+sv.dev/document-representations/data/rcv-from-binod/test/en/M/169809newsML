U . S . foreign crudes take back seat , arb uneconomic . U . S . foreign crudes took a back seat to cheaper alternative domestic grades as prices remained relatively expensive due to an uneconomic arbitrage . Few parcels were seen offered although supply was available for late - November and December . North Sea Brent , which dropped further to trade at Dec Brent - 57 cents fob for Nov 14 - 16 , was offered into the U . S . at Dec West Texas Intermediate + 20 cents cif for Dec 1 - 10 . Oseberg earlier this week sold to a U . S . Gulf refiner at Dec WTI + 10 - 15 cents cif for Dec 1 - 5 delivery , a competitive level due to the current overhang in Europe . Regional crudes were scarcely talked but Ecopetrol had a cargo of Cano Limon and Vasconia to move in December . The Cano Limon for second - half Dec was pegged at Dec WTI - $ 1 . 50 fob , while Vasconia for Dec 4 - 8 was priced at Dec WTI - $ 2 . 00 fob , holding at steady levels , traders said . Elsewhere , Chile ' s ENAP received offered into its purchase tender for 960 , 000 barrels of December crude , but results of the tender were not available . In the U . S . after - market , Dec Brent partials traded at $ 22 . 20 a barrel , up about four cents from London ' s IPE close . Inter - month Brent spreads were barely changed with Dec / Jan pegged at 30 / 32 cents , and Jan / Feb at 44 / 46 cents . - - Jacqueline Wong , New York Energy Desk + 1 212 859 1620

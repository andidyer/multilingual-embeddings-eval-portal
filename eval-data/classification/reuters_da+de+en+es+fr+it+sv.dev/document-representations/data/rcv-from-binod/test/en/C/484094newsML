Kazakh oil chief unveils company ' s ambitious goals . The chairman of state company Kazakh Oil said on Thursday his main tasks were to make Kazakhstan a major oil producer and enrich the hard - up nation . " We are sure we will do everything possible for Kazakh Oil to take leading positions on the world ' s oil market and become a powerful factor in the Kazakh economy , " Nurlan Balgimbayev , former Oil and Gaz Minister , told a news conference . The oil and gas ministry was transformed into a national oil company in line with a presidential decree aiming to cut down bureaucracy and unwieldy state machinery . Balgimbayev said the idea was to " have a new , flexible and efficient structure , able to work in the conditions of a free market " . " In the long run , the idea is to earn from oil , not to rule oil , " said Balgimbayev , whose company will report directly to the president and prime minister . Kazakhstan , a vast steppeland former Soviet republic with a population of 16 . 9 million people , sits on estimated reserves of over three billion tonnes of oil , and Balgimbayev said the main policy of the company was " to let Kazakhstan ' s people see and enjoy the fruits of exploiting these reserves " . The Central Asian state plans to produce 26 . 5 million tonnes of oil this year , up from 23 million last year , but unchanged from peak years in Soviet times . Oil output is targeted to soar to 170 million tonnes by the year 2010 . Balgimbayev , clearly trying to destroy an image that Kazakh oil firms opposed rapid sell - offs to foreigners , said targets of higher oil output were " unobtainable without a massive influx of foreign investment " . He said direct foreign investment in oil projects was likely to soar in the next few years to $ 40 billion from around $ 2 billion invested so far . U . S . - based Chevron Corp and Mobil Corp are already in a $ 20 billion project to tap Kazakhstan ' s giant Tengiz oil field , where production is now about 160 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) but will peak at 700 , 000 bpd by 2010 . Tengiz has estimated reserves of at least six billion barrels . Balgimbayev said Kazakh Oil would manage state - owned stakes in joint ventures with foreign firms , as well as the state ' s remaining stakes in companies sold to strategic investors . " The assets we are holding are large enough , " Balgimbayev said . He did not exclude that Kazakh Oil could try and buy the state - owned stakes it currently manages if the government offered them to portfolio investors on the country ' s nascent shares market . Pledging " to defend the country ' s interests on international oil markets " , Balgimbayev also said the company was planning to invest massively in Kazakhstan to back its economy . - - Almaty Newsroom , + 7 3272 509410

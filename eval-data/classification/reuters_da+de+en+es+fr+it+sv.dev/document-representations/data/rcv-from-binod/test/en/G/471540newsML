Zaire rebels say talks to start soon . The head of Zaire ' s rebel delegation at an African summit said on Thursday the first talks with President Mobutu Sese Seko ' s government would begin soon . " We are very excited to learn that for the first time the people ( authorities ) of Kinshasa have decided to agree to a starting of the negotiations which are going to be in a very few days to come , " Bizima Karaha told a news conference . Laurent Kabila ' s disciplined fighters control about a quarter of Zaire ' s vast territory , five months into their rebellion against Mobutu ' s 32 - year rule . Karaha said likely venues for the talks were South Africa and Togo . He said Kabila would not take part and he added a strong note of scepticism on the likely success of the talks . " We do not trust them much because they are known for giving so many promises but we shall wait for such a time for them to fulfil their commitment , " Karaha said . The warring parties were both in Togo ' s capital for Wednesday ' s special Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit on the Zaire crisis . The rebels made clear from the outset they were not in Lome to negotiate but they did agree to a handshake with Mobutu ' s team in a private meeting late on Wednesday , Togo said . Mobutu , stricken with prostate cancer and with his army routed in the field , looks far more inclined to strike a deal with Kabila than vice versa . Karaha gave no idea of the agenda for talks but Kabila ' s view that the bottom line is the end of the Mobutu era was clearly repeated at Thursday ' s news conference . " It would be in Mobutu ' s interest to negotiate his own departure , " Gaetan Kakudji , another rebel delegate in Lome said .

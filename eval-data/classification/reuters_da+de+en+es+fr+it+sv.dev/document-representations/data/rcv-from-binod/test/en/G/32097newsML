Weather lengthens U . S . astronaut ' s stay in space . Hurricane Fran forced the Atlantis space shuttle off its launching pad on Wednesday , delaying by several days the return of U . S . astronaut Shannon Lucid from Russia ' s Mir space station . Although the hurricane was expected to pass well offshore , NASA officials ordered the shuttle back to its hangar as a precaution . " There were too many unknowns about what it was going to do , " NASA spokesman George Diller said . Atlantis was due to be launched on Sept . 14 but will now face a two - day delay , space agency officials said . The shuttle could be back on the pad as early as Thursday morning . The mission to pick Lucid up and drop off her replacement is already running six weeks late because of problems with the spaceship ' s booster rockets . Lucid , a biochemist and 53 - year - old mother of three , has been working aboard the orbiting station since March and was originally due home in early August . NASA officials said they had told her of the latest delay . Former astronaut Frank Culbertson , who heads NASA ' s shuttle - Mir programme , informed Lucid of the delay by telephone from his home in Houston via Russia ' s mission control . " Her only reaction was just that we should look after Atlantis and she ' d still be there waiting for us , " NASA spokesman Rob Navias said . It was the second time in two months the weather had forced Atlantis to take shelter . The shuttle scurried back to its assembly building in July when Hurricane Bertha threatened the Florida coastline . Hurricane Fran is also likely to delay the planned Oct . 31 launch of the shuttle Columbia , because work to assemble its booster rockets has been held up for almost a week while NASA waited for the storm to pass .

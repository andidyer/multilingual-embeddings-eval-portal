US corporate debt flat , Chrysler deal affirms tone . U . S . corporate bonds were unchanged in light trade on Thursday , while big new issues sold easily and bolstered market tone , dealers said . Chrysler Corp ' s $ 500 million century bond , priced as 7 . 45s to yield 81 basis points over the Treasury long bond , was several times oversubscribed , according to a source not included in the debt syndicate . The issue was sold in a 144A private placement offering via Salomon Brothers . Secondary activity was relatively thin with little direction taken from the Treasuries as players there braced for January U . S . employment data on Friday , traders said . Moderate trade surrounded News Corp debt , meanwhile , after the company reported lower than expected profit for the first half of 1997 . Bonds actually firmed two to four basis points , perhaps because News Corp also relayed confidence its profits would rise 20 percent for the year , a trader said . In addition , supply was simply light on the Street despite the onset of some huge issues over the past week . High - grade buyers were also faced with a $ 700 million Yankee issue from Bank Austria . The 20 - year , Aa1 / AAA rated private placement deal was priced as 7 . 25s to yield 50 basis points over Treasuries . Trading desks were busied with snapping up longer bonds in hopes of capitalizing on the 30 - year roll when the Treasury begins its quarterly refunding next week , traders said . Deals priced earlier this week were largely unchanged . Philip Morris ' $ 500 million in 10 - year debt traded right on its issue bid of 78 basis points over the curve . Elsewhere , J . P .

Once the structure becomes a standard product , he said supply will become more abundant from all issuers across the credit spectrum . Nanette Abuhoff , J . P . Morgan ' s fixed - income strategist said corporate CPI - linked notes offer higher yields than T - notes and , in a current pay structure , have higher coupons . One trader noted possible adjustment in CPI would not likely stem issuance , since the direction would be down . That may be pose an obstacle for buyers , however , he said . Turning to the high - yield market , traders reported sluggish dealings and prices were mostly flat . New issues trickled in off a rather large roadshow calendar , they added , and those bonds were bid higher at the close .

CD - ROM media market slow in catching on . The market for CD - ROM titles , games or reference works on compact discs , is slow in catching on and will remain largely unprofitable for some years , experts told the MILIA multimedia trade show on Saturday . " The number of CD titles published is still totally out of line with the size of the market , " said Ben Keen of Screen Digest , showing that a best - selling title in Europe has difficulty reaching the 10 , 000 units mark . Keen made the comment during a series of opening speeches at the MILIA show which is being held here until Wednesday with some 1 , 170 companies showing off their wares . While the internet and digital television are clamouring for attention with announcements about new developments over the coming days , the " old " medium of compact - discs for computers claimed the opening day . Keen said that in 1996 , 43 million CD - ROM ' s were sold in Europe for a value of $ 2 . 3 billion while this was 56 million in the U . S . In Europe , the biggest market for CD - ROM ' s is Germany , followed by France and Italy while Britain comes fourth . Games make up about 70 percent of sales in Germany , Spain , the U . K . and U . S . , while it is closer to 50 percent in France , Italy and Japan . Julie Schwerin , chairman of data researchers InfoTech , said that the world wide CD - ROM market exceeded $ 30 billion in 1996 and is expected to grow by over 30 percent in 1997 . The installed base of CD - ROM players passed the 100 million level in 1996 . " Consumer titles contributed 31 . 4 percent of total worldwide CD - ROM title revenue in 1996 . Yet the worldwide consumer multimedia publishing industry as a whole operated at a net loss , " she said . To add insult to injury , the top selling CD - ROM publishing companies are Walt Disney and Microsoft , for which the business is a secondary line of activity . Schwerin said that technological issues threw up big obstacles for CD - ROM publishers . In 1997 alone , they have to adapt to an update of the Windows 95 operating system , the new MMX multimedia chip from Intel and the arrival of Digital Video Disc ( DVD ) which will succeed the CD - ROM . InfoTech expects that just over four CD - ROM titels will be sold per driver in 1997 . A move to the internet is for publishers " going from the frying pan to the fire " because internet advertising revenues are forecast to contribute just one percent of the multimedia industry revenue in 1997 . A possible solution is to bring out hybrid products which combine discs with the internet or digital television . Benedict Tompkins , of mergers and acquisitions advisors Broadview Associates , said he expected an increasing number of deals combining content , technology and communications . Last week ' s French alliance of publisher Havas , the Cegetel telecoms unit of Generale des Eaux and pay television group Canal Plus is an illustration of this trend . Another , smaller , example is NetGem . This French firm will sell a set - top box to turn a digital television into an internet terminal from April at 2 , 000 francs .

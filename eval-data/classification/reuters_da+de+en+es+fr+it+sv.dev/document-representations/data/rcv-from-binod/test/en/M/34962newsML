Iraq ' s dinar gains as clashes with U . S . subsides . The Iraqi dinar gained against the U . S . dollar and prices of essential foodstuffs fell slightly as clashes with the United States subsided , traders and money dealers said on Thursday . Iraq ' s dinar currency soared to 1 , 200 to the dollar from about 1 , 750 on Wednesday . The surge in the value of the dinar has already sent down prices of essential commodities . A kg ( 2 . 2 lb ) of sugar went down to 800 dinars from 1 , 300 on Wednesday , a kg of flour was sold at 500 down from 750 and a kg of rice fetched 600 dinars down from 1 , 000 . Traders attributed Thursday ' s surge in the dinar ' s value to the U . S . announcement that its mission in Iraq was achieved by cruise missile attacks . They also said that Russian , French and Chinese criticisms of Washington ' s position was a contributing factor . The United States fired a total of 44 cruise missiles on Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday on air defence targets in southern Iraq to minimise Iraqi resistance to its warplanes policing an expanded no - fly zone in southern Iraq . The U . S . attack came after Iraqi troops and armour intervened at the weekend in northern Iraq to help one Kurdish faction in its fight with another Kurdish group . Iraqi media toned down their defiant rhetoric , a sign that Baghdad may avoid escalating its military row with the United States . Newspapers avoided fiery comments or editorials . Early this year Baghdad ' s oil talks with the U . N . led to spectacular gains for the dinar . From about 3 , 000 to the dollar it rose at times at 450 . But signing of the deal on May 20 sent it on a roller - coaster ride again . Since Iraqi troops went into the north , the deal has been delayed by the U . N . Secretary - General .

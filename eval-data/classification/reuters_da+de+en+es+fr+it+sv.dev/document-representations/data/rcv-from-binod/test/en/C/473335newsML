Analysts mixed on tiny new Ericsson phone . Swedish telecoms group Ericsson reports buoyant sales of its tiny GF 788 mobile telephone in two weeks since its debut but analysts said on Thursday they were divided about its potential . Some analysts question its weight , the size of its display and the older - style batteries it uses , although it is cheaper than its main current rival . " Sales of the new phone have already reached 200 , 000 , " Ericsson vice president Kjell Johanson said . " We hope that this phone . . . and our other products will at least help us keep our GSM market share and preferably add some market share percentage to it , " he told Reuters . Currently , Ericsson holds 25 - 30 percent of the total phone market for the GSM digital telephone standard . Johanson said he was very happy with the sales of the GF 788 , which is only slightly larger than a playing card and about the size of U . S . rival Motorola ' s StarTAC . " We have even ordered extra charter flights from our production centre because stores are out of phones , " he said . The GF 788 is supposed to compete with StarTAC , which some are calling the world ' s smallest telephone . Some analysts say the Ericsson version will give StarTAC a run for its money . " I ' ve seen extremely good reviews of it in the trade press about its functionality and so on but it is too early to draw any conclusions , " Neil Barton , analyst at Merrill Lynch , said . " The signs look extremely good and the development shown at ( the Hanover fair ) CeBit will put Ericsson in a very strong position in 1997 . " But other analysts are uncertain about the phone ' s competitiveness . " At first it looks competitive but a closer look is somewhat of a disappointment , " Lauri Rosendahl , analyst at Aros Securities , said . " It is small but it is heavy . It weighs 135 grams , while StarTAC weighs 100 grams . " Rosendahl also said it was strange that Ericsson , unlike other large manufacturers , chose to have a nickel metal hydride ( NiMH ) battery instead of a modern lithium - ion battery - - which is easier to charge - - in a high - end phone . He added that the displays of both the StarTAC and the GF 788 were too small . Both Rosendahl and Barton instead favoured Philips ' forthcoming telephone , Genie . " Philips will soon launch its Genie , which looks superior to both StarTAC and GF 788 , " Rosendahl said . " A new group of 100 - gram phones is being created with StarTAC and Genie and I assume Nokia and Ericsson will get there eventually . " Finnish Nokia does not have a tiny phone like Ericsson and Motorola , analysts said , although Rosendahl noted that Nokia ' s somewhat larger 8110 weighed only 150 grams . But Barton dismissed the weight difference between the GF 788 and StarTAC , saying all the phones were so small that it no longer mattered . Analysts pointed out that Ericsson ' s product was much cheaper , costing about 7 , 500 crowns ( $ 990 ) , compared with StarTAC ' s price of around 13 , 000 crowns . The GF 788 must sell well for a long time to become profitable and to pay for its advertising launch , which Ericsson said cost 300 million crowns . " The campaign is designed to make us known in the market , to build a knowledge about the brand name , " Johanson said . ( $ = 7 . 590 Swedish Crowns )

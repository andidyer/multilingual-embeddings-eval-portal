Norway ' s Bona shares seen more liquid . The distribution of shares in Bona Shipholding ASA by Norwegian shipping company Leif Hoegh & Co ASA should improve liquidity in the trading of Bona ' s stock but analysts were divided as to whether it will lift the share price . Leif Hoegh announced Monday that it is planning to distribute up to 2 . 5 million shares worth about 200 million crowns ( $ 27 . 5 million ) in the Oslo - listed tanker company to its shareholders . The distribution of one Bona share to each holder of 12 Leif Hoegh shares will reduce its holding in Bona to 33 . 5 percent , from about 42 . 3 percent . Leif Hoegh board secretary Niels Ronald Bugge said : " By increasing the number of shareholders and the number of shares available to Norwegian investors , we believe we will see more trading in the stock . " Norwegian investment in Bona is limited by law to no more than 50 percent and the large Leif Hoegh stake had squeezed liquidity hard . The company added in an earlier press statement that it expected the move to have " an upside potential in the long term for Bona shareholders . " However , a Norwegian shipping analyst , who asked not to be named , said : " I don ' t think it will do a lot to the price in the short run . " " Bona is fairly well priced and there are plenty of foreign shareholders ready to pick stock up if the price falls , " he added . Bona ' s shares have been trading recently at 78 - 80 crowns but in April were at a low of 66 crowns . However , a London analyst said : " There could be a significant uplift to Bona ' s shares . " He compared Bona , which is trading at around a 13 percent discount to net asset value , with New York - listed Teekay Shipping Corp which is trading at a premium . " There is an anomaly between Teekay and Bona , particularly as Bona is enjoying better rates in the U . S . Gulf to Caribbean Aframax trades than Teekay is in the Pacific , " he said . However , he added that there was still a liquidity problem because of the 50 percent Norwegian investment restrictions . The Norwegian analyst said the move was positive for Bona in terms of liquidity and was particular welcome because rival tanker firm Frontline AB switches from a Stockholm to an Oslo listing this week . Bugge added that the distribution of shares could be made within about a week of an extraordinary shareholders ' meeting , being held on July 15 , to discuss the issue . - Paul Berrill , Reuters Shipping News + 44 171 542 4087 .

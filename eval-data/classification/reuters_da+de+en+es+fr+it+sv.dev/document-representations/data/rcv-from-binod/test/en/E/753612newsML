Pakistan , IMF agree on major loan . Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said on Thursday they had agreed on a structural adjustment programme that could provide Islamabad a loan of at least $ 1 . 6 billion . Fund director for the Middle East Paul Chabrier told a news conference the loan would involve an extended structural adjustment facility ( ESAF ) and an extended Fund facility ( EFF ) , with ESAF forming the major part . " Apart from very minor details , we have agreed on this programme and we will bring it back to Washington , " he said . He said the first tranche of the loan could be disbursed as soon as the executive board of the IMF agreed to the programme . Pakistan Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said : " I am glad to say that we have reached an agreement on the main elements of the policy framework paper . " " The first tranche would be disbursed a few days after the approval of the board , " Chabrier said . " The size is still to be discussed but it would not be less than $ 1 . 6 billion . So it is a little bit more than what was being reported in the press . " " The programme is to be supported by a mix of ESAF and EFF , " Chabrier said , adding that the ratio had to be discussed . " But there will be more ESAF than EFF . " ESAF and EFF are instruments under which the Fund provides loans to a country for balance of payments support . Under ESAF a country has to pay a 0 . 5 percent interest rate . The rate of interest on EFF is higher than five percent . Pakistan signed a $ 1 . 5 billion , three - year ESAF programme with the IMF in February 1994 , but the Fund halted disbursements after the former government of then prime minister Benazir Bhutto announced a budget that failed to meet agreed targets . A balance of payments crisis in October 1995 forced Bhutto to seek an IMF standby loan , which was suspended in March last year , again because of missed targets . The standby loan was resumed and expanded in December after a caretaker government took over , but the IMF halted it in March when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ' s government said the targets were out of reach . Chabrier on Thursday said the Pakistani economy had a number of problems but that was changing with Sharif ' s government . " You had quite a number of distortions in the economy , you had systems which were inefficient , " Chabrier said . " What impressed us the most during the mission is that your government has provided a vision of where the economy should go , " he added . Chabrier said IMF was " particularly impressed " by the reforms undertaken by the government in trade , taxation , banking and other sectors of the economy . " The measures taken are very bold , " he added .

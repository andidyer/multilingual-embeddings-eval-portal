CRICKET - ENGLAND MAKE DREAM START TO ASHES SERIES . England , fired by pace pair Darren Gough and Andy Caddick , made a perfect start to the first test against Australia on one of the most compelling opening days of an Ashes series on Thursday . Gough captured three for 43 and Caddick took five for 50 as Australia , who won the toss and opted to bat , were routed for 118 shortly after lunch . Having exploited favourable conditions to make just the start they wanted , England faltered briefly , losing captain Michael Atherton and debutant Mark Butcher for 16 in the first four overs . But the damage was repaired as Nasser Hussain ( 80 not out ) and Graham Thorpe ( 83 not out ) , coming together at 50 for three after Alec Stewart was out , shared an unbroken fourth wicket partnership of 150 to spur England to 200 for three at the close . They were both severe on Australia ' s potential match - winner Shane Warne , who can only hope the pitch is taking spin by the time England bat again - if they need to . Equally disappointing for Australian captain Mark Taylor was the fact that his highly - regarded strike bowler Glenn McGrath was unable to take greater advantage of humid conditions after dismissing Atherton cheaply . With Jason Gillespie straining a hamstring and another paceman , Andy Bichel , already ruled out , the Australians are likely to send for another bowler . " It looks as though we ' re going to need one , " said coach Geoff Marsh , who named Paul Reiffel of Victoria and Adam Dale of Queensland as contenders . Marsh admitted : " We batted badly and bowled badly . We ' ve got to work hard tp turn it round . " Taylor ' s poor form continued when he was dismissed for only seven and his lack of confidence spread to to his team mates . He saw his opening partner Matthew Elliott bowled by Gough for six , then lost his own wicket when he edged a wide ball from Devon Malcolm to Butcher at second slip . When Gough , roared on by a noisy and enthusiastic sell - out crowd of 22 , 000 , bowled Mark Waugh ( five ) and had Greg Blewett ( seven ) taken at third slip , Australia were 28 for four with less than an hour played . As Gough rested , with figures of three for 18 in eight overs , New Zealand - born Caddick took over to send back Steve Waugh ( 12 ) and Ian Healy ( 0 ) in successive balls . Both were given out caught behind by Alec Stewart , though television replays suggested that Waugh had not touched the ball . Michael Bevan ( eight ) , the last recognised batsman , was next to go , giving Mark Ealham an easy catch at gully off Malcolm , who was returning to test cricket after an absence of 17 months . Jason Gillespie , having narrowly avoided becoming a hat - trick victim , fell lbw in Caddick ' s next over for four . Only Warne , with a spirited 47 from 46 balls , resisted for long , with none of the recognised batsmen lasting more than 25 balls . England ' s coach David Lloyd described the day as the best of his 12 months in charge . But he insisted : " There ' s a long way to go . We won ' t be preening ourselves on one day ' s cricket . "

NWE high , low sulphur fuel oil edge higher . NWE high sulphur fuel oil edged higher on Friday as a little fresh buying emerged , traders said . High sulphur barges changed hands at $ 99 and $ 100 a tonne in the morning , then later at $ 101 . Dealers said that at least some of the strength could be attributed to the trading strategy of one trader in the barge market . A little extra demand for high sulphur cargoes was seen supporting numbers , and a trader was heard seeking fresh barrels to cover utility commitments . Material was seen available in sufficient quantities to cover this demand . Low sulphur markets were around a dollar stronger although the market was quiet . While dealers attributed the gains to higher crude oil futures as much as anything else , trades were concluded earlier in the week at floating prices , including sales of U . K . - Origin and Scandinavian and French barrels to cover existing commitments . These deals appear to have siphoned some of the obvious length from the market . Physical low sulphur markets were assessed at around $ 99 fob NWE . - - London newsroom + 44 171 542 8167

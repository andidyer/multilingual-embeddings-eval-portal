The two countries fought a border war in 1962 and troops are still deployed along both sides of the rugged line of actual control . India and China signed an agreement in 1993 to ease tension along their 4 , 000 km ( 2 , 500 mile ) frontier during a visit by former prime minister P . V . Narasimha Rao to Beijing . In August 1995 , India and China agreed to pull back their troops from four border posts in India ' s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh , parts of which are claimed by China . PTI gave few details of the other agreements but said the shipping pact envisaged direct links between the two countries that were expected to result in a rise in Sino - Indian trade . According to official statistics , two - way trade totalled $ 1 . 16 billion in 1995 after $ 895 million in 1994 . On Thursday , Jiang and Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said friendship between their countries could be a key to world peace . " I am convinced that the Chinese and Indian peoples joining together will be a great force and an important guarantee for peace in Asia and the world at large , " Jiang said . Sharma also made an apparent reference to China ' s friendship with Pakistan , saying New Delhi was concerned by actions that adversely affected regional security . Pakistan has enjoyed close relations with China since the 1960s . In recent years , the two countries have been accused of secret nuclear and missile deals , which both have denied . Sharma said India was prepared to work with China to resolve differences on the boundary issue . On ties between India and China , one Western diplomat said : " Indian policy makers generally agree that China is a problem to be managed . " The strategy is to try to build elements of stability into the relationship that will survive ups and downs and any change in Chinese policy . " There were several protests by pro - democracy Tibetan exiles in the Indian capital on Friday . On Thursday , exiles burnt an effigy of Jiang and the Chinese flag . India support China ' s jurisdiction over Tibet , which Beijing annexed in 1950 .

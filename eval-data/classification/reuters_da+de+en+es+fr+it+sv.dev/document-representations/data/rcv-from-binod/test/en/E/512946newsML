Bulgaria c . banker warns against reform delay . Bulgarian central bank governor Lyubomir Filipov said on Wednesday the lev currency risked a new depreciation unless a currency board regime was introduced by July at the latest . In an interview with Reuters and Reuters Financial Television , Filipov said implementation of a restrictive monetary policy known as a currency board , would help sustain long - term economic stabilisation , but new delays were risky . " The currency board should be introduced not later than the middle of July as the domestic foreign exchange market is very vulnerable before Brady bond coupon payments , " said Filipov . " The very beginning of June will be best , " he added . Bulgaria pays twice a year some $ 130 million in coupon payments on Brady bonds issued three years ago to restructure a $ 8 . 16 billion dollar foreign commercial debt . The lev traditionally comes under pressure in the second half of July as part of the sum is usually purchased on the local interbank forex market . Delayed reforms and political instability pressed the lev two months ago to a record low of 3 , 000 to the dollar , but stringent spending controls by the interim cabinet and funding deals sealed with international lenders helped it recover to around 1 , 500 now . Filipov said the financial support pledged by the IMF , the World Bank , the European Union and rich countries totalling around $ 1 . 2 billion covered Bulgaria ' s foreign debt dues this year . " The loans could act as catalyst to speed up reforms and privatisation and help attract more capital inflow mainly through direct investments , " said Filipov . Under the currency board system , the central bank will consist of three departments , said Filipov . One department will oversee that the amount of local money in the economy has to be fully covered by foreign reserves . A daily balance sheet would be published . A banking department will be used as a lender of last resort by local commercial banks , only " if systemic risk for the banks occurs " . Otherwise , central bank lending to banks and government will be banned . A strengthened bank supervision department will oversee bank licensing and operation . Slack banking supervision in the past and mismanagement has led to the insolvency of four local banks and to a further 11 being placed in receivership . Filipov was optimistic about the future of the remaining two dozen commercial banks under the currency board system , despite their heavy reliance on central bank funding in the past . " The banks now have positive capital , no liquidity problems , and I think they can enter the currency board arrangement without any special problems , " he said . But he warned that banking stability was hinged on the performance of the real economy . Multilateral lenders have urged Bulgaria to speed up sell - offs of state factories , shut down lossmakers and encourage private businesses and foreign investment . These targets along with introducing the currency board system have to be achieved by the new government and parliament due to be formed after April 19 elections . The new parliament is also expected to elect a new governor and deputy governors of the Bulgarian National Bank .

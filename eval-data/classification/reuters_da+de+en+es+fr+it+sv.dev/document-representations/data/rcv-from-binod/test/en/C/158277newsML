RTRS - IAMA in Primac undertaking . Rural services group IAMA Ltd on Thursday gave an undertaking to the Queensland Supreme Court that it would not despatch a formal Part A takeover document to fellow rural group Primac Holdings Ltd , a Primac spokesman said . A further court hearing has been set down for next Monday . The IAMA undertaking follows legal action taken by Primac on Wednesday to prevent despatch of a revised IAMA Part A takeover offer . IAMA is offering nine of its shares for every 10 Primac , an offer Primac directors have said appeared inadequate . Talks with IAMA to achieve adequate disclosure in the Part A documents had broken down , Primac chairman Steve Morrow said on Wednesday . Primac subsequently made application to the court to restrain despatch of IAMA ' s revised Part A , Morrow said . Morrow declined to comment on reports that Primac was having talks of its own with rival rural groups Wesfarmers Ltd and Elders Australia Ltd . Primac is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on Friday in Brisbane . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 373 - 1800

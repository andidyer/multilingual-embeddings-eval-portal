SOCCER - REAL GO TOP AFTER SPOILING BEBETO ' S DEBUT .

With 29 points from 13 games Real go one point clear of Barcelona ahead of the Catalans ' home game with Valladolid on Monday . The game started at a hectic pace with clear chances missed at both ends in the opening minute . Brazilian striker Bebeto came close to scoring on his debut as Sevilla had the best of the opening sorties . But a mistake in the Sevilla defence in the 19th minute let through Predrag Mijatovic , who didn ' t think twice before rifling home a shot that gave Sevilla keeper Monchi Rodriguez no chance . Real took charge after the goal and 10 minutes later Real made it 2 - 0 when Mijatovic ' s strike - partner , Croatian Euro 96 star Davor Suker broke through down the right . Suker instinctively raised his arms after scoring before remembering his pre - match promise of not celebrating a goal out of respect for the fans at the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium who had idolised him during his five years at Sevilla . Real slowed after the break and Salva Ballesta put Sevilla back in the game after capitalising on a defensive mix - up to head home a cross by Rafa Paz in the 54th minute . But Real stifled what looked like a Sevilla come - back seven minutes later when Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos found Mijatovic totally unmarked at a corner , and the Montenegrin had time to control the ball and blast home the third . " People could see we aren ' t as bad as some people say , " said Real president Lorenzo Sanz after the game " It was an important win , which means Barcelona don ' t get away from us . " In other games played on Sunday Athletic Bilbao continued their recovery after a poor start to the season with an impressive 4 - 2 win at Sporting Gijon , which lifts the Basque side to sixth place .

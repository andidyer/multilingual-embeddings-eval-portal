Former apartheid secret agent arrested in Angola . A former secret agent who was involved in bombing anti - apartheid activists is being held in an Angolan jail , apparently in connection with immigration irregularities , South African officials said on Tuesday . Craig Williamson , who has publicly admitted running covert operations against Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress ( ANC ) and other anti - apartheid groups , was arrested by Angolan police at his Luanda hotel on Friday , South Africa ambassador Roger Ballard - Tremer said . " On Thursday the Angolan authorities went to the hotel where he was staying , to inspect his documents . On Friday they returned and arrested him in his hotel room , " Ballard - Tremer told Reuters . Williamson has acknowledged a role in three bombings of anti - apartheid activists in the 1980s , including the killing of Jeanette Schoon and her six - year - old daughter , Katryn . The two were killed by a letter bomb in Lubango , Angola , in June 1984 by a device apparently intended for husband and father Marius Schoon , an operative of Mandela ' s ANC . Williamson recently denied involvement in the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme , an accusation levelled at him by a former police death squad colonel on trial in Pretoria for murder . Sweden said last week it would send investigators to South Africa to follow up new leads into Palme ' s killing . Asked if Williamson ' s detention might be linked to the Palme investigation , Ballard - Tremer said : " We haven ' t had government to government contact , but he is being held in the same cells as four other South Africans ( held ) on immigration irregularities suspicions . " We believe this is why he is being held , until we are informed otherwise , " the envoy said , adding that the embassy hoped to be allowed to contact Williamson later on Tuesday . Williamson ' s business interests in Angola include supplying food and equipment to firms operating in the diamond - rich Lunda Norte province . The four other South Africans in detention were arrested in that same area last week . More than 45 South Africans have been deported from Angola in a two - month crackdown by the Luanda government on immigration and business irregularities .

CME live and feeder cattle seen higher . CME live and feeder cattle futures were both expected to open 0 . 250 to 1 . 000 cent higher following Friday ' s bullishly construed monthly USDA Cattle - on - Feed Report , analysts said . Friday ' s cattle report showed December placements well under trade expectations and this should spark early demand , especially in April and June live cattle futures , analysts said . The report put placements at 98 percent of a year ago , well under the average estimate of 108 . 2 percent and the range of estimates of 103 to 112 percent . However , February live cattle may show scale up resistance from the continued weak tone to cash beef and expectations of larger near term supplies of fed cattle , analysts said . The Cattle - on - Feed Report was also viewed as bullish for feeder cattle . Feeder prices have been rising lately even with the low feedlot placements last month , and this points to tight feeder supplies . Calls for lower corn futures should also lend support , they said . The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $ 0 . 03 at $ 70 . 18 per cwt . ( ( Jerry Bieszk 312 - 408 - 8725 ) )

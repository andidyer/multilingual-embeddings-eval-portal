StatsCan acreage data seen bullish to canola - trade . Statistics Canada ' s second seeding intentions report for the 1997 / 98 ( Aug / July ) crop year Friday was considered bullish to canola , grain analysts said . " Canola was on the low side . People were looking for a higher number with estimates closer the 12 . 5 million acres and some acres didn ' t get planted , " LFG analyst Rob Dzisiak said . StatsCan surveyed Canadian farmers between May 26 and June 4 for its second seeding intentions report and found they intended to seed 12 . 1 million acres to canola . Trade expectations ranged from 12 . 1 to 12 . 6 million acres . Winnipeg Commodity Exchange canola were called up C $ 1 a tonne . " All wheat was a little on the low side and the report didn ' t take into account unseeded acres in Alberta , " he said . On June 17 , Alberta Agriculture said 600 , 000 to 800 , 000 acres in the central Peace River Valley and the Athabasca crop district would not be seeded to wheat and canola due to the cool , wet spring . StatsCan pegged all wheat for all of Canada at 28 . 2 million acres in line with trade expectations . " It ' s not bullish to the feed grains because of the carryout , " another analyst said . WCE feed wheat futures were called down C $ 0 . 50 a tonne . The Canadian Wheat Board in March said it deferred sales of 1 . 5 million tonnes of grain to the coming crop year due to a backlog of ships at Pacific ports which cost it more than C $ 15 million in demurrage fines . " The barley number ' s neutral to a little friendly , traders had expected a number between 12 . 5 to 13 million , " a third source said . StatsCan forecast barley acreage at 12 . 4 million acres . WCE western barley was called C $ 0 . 50 a tonne lower on CBOT corn calls with new crop contracts drawing support from StatsCan , analysts said . " I thought the flax number was way out of line in April at 2 . 28 so 2 . 07 is definitely more in line with my expectation but it could be viewed as friendly by the trade because it is a 9 . 2 percent drop from April , " the third source added . StatsCan estimated flax acreage at 2 . 07 million acres . Opinion , however , was divided on how WCE flax would open . Some traders expected it to gain C $ 1 a tonne from the acreage estimate while others believed it would lose C $ 1 under follow through pressure from Thursday ' s trade . StatsCan set oats area at 4 . 7 million acres , in line with trade expectations . ( ( Gilbert Le Gras , Winnipeg Reuters bureau 204 947 3548 ) )

Mexico yr - end peso seen near 8 . 0 per dlr - Dornbusch . Noted economist Rudiger Dornbusch said on Wednesday that an exchange rate of 8 . 0 Mexican pesos to the dollar would be a realistic exchange rate to emerge if the currency depreciates in line with Mexican inflation . Dornbusch told Santander Investment on Wednesday that , " by the end of the year an exchange rate of 8 . 0 pesos to the dollar would be the rate realistically emerging from such a strategy . " Comments attributed to Dornbusch in a Mexico City newspaper on Wednesday - - that the peso should be 20 percent lower than at present - - caused the peso and other stocks to weaken . On Tuesday Dornbusch said , at a conference sponsored by Santander Investment in New York , that a maxi - devaluation of the Mexican peso would be totally inappropriate .

" Dornbusch ' s comments from the closed conference on Tuesday and his comments on Wednesday were released by Santander in a report on Wednesday . Santander has a year - end 1996 forecast of 8 . 01 per dollar , which was revised from 8 . 5 pesos per dollar at year - end in early September . The peso has been volatile lately .

Santander also reiterated its forecast for 1996 gross domestic product growth at 4 . 5 percent . Its 1996 inflation target is 26 . 9 percent . - - Robert Kozak , Mexico City newsroom ( 525 ) 728 9559

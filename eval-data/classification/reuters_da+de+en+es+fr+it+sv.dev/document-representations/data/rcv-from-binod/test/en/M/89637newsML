Hong Kong gold ends down on overseas sales . Hong Kong gold prices continued their downward slide on Tuesday , ending sharply below New York ' s Monday close on stop - loss selling and a lack of physical buying , traders and dealers said . " I think some more stop - loss orders will be executed within this period , " said one gold trader shortly before the Hong Kong gold market closed . Gold demand in Hong Kong and in other parts of Asia had stalled largely because buyers anticipated further drops in the price of gold , dealers said . Physical gold demand had been dampened further in Hong Kong by the National Day holiday in China October 1 - 2 . " Some of the demand in Hong Kong is from China , so if China stops buying , then it will definitely be felt in Hong Kong , " said a trader at another international bank . Australian producers were eager to sell gold in Hong Kong and were said to be making attractive offers , gold traders said . " We saw some very good offers from Australian producers who want buyers for their gold at these levels , " said one gold source at an international bank .

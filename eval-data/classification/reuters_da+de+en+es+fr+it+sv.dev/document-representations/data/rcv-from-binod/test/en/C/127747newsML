INTERVIEW - Lombard Odier reduces bond exposure . Swiss private bank Lombard Odier & Cie is taking a cautious approach to global fixed income markets and has reduced assets held in bonds , its chief strategist Patrizio Merciai said . " We have been reducing our bond exposure in the last three months , " Merciai , the bank ' s chief economist and investment strategist , said in an interview . He added up to around half of overall assets were invested in equities , with the focus on a small number of stocks with good earnings potential . Cash exposure was raised earlier this year at the expense of bonds , but has lately been reduced slightly in favour of equities , as bonds appear to offer fewer buying opportunities , he said . Lombard Odier is one of Switzerland ' s largest private banks . It has an estimated $ 50 billion of funds under management , according to the 1995 / 96 Wernlin Directory of private banks . Merciai said Lombard Odier thought U . S . bond yields would probably go sideways in the short term but edge up in nine to 12 months . The bank would stick to shorter maturities to reduce volatility , he said , but would see a rise in U . S . long bond yields to roughly 7 . 25 percent as a possible buying opportunity for high - quality bonds . " At 7 . 25 percent yield we would be protected with any inflation pick - up to the 3 - 1 / 2 to four percent range , " he said . With respect to Japanese bonds , he said Lombard Odier was very cautious , seeing a supply problem because of the country ' s budget deficit . In Europe , Lombard Odier was taking profits on Mediterranean bonds but had kept some " core bonds " in markets like Germany and Denmark . " We are not eager to buy more , " Merciai said . He said Lombard Odier had taken profits in French Oats , as markets gave the appearance of having already priced in completely European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) set for 1999 , a stance that could be seen as premature . " We have been selling them ( Oats ) because they are yielding less than German bonds . It means the market has priced them equivalent to German bonds . We still have two years . " In Italy too it appeared a rally in bonds might be close to its end , he said . In general , there was a risk that markets were too optimistic about European budget cuts . Currently , assets held for institutions in global balanced accounts were roughly six percent in cash , down from 10 percent in the second quarter . But private accounts , which are Swiss - franc based with medium - risk profiles , may hold roughly 20 percent of assets in cash currently . " The rule for private assets is that cash is used to reduce risk in the base currency , " Merciai said . On the Swiss franc , he said there appeared to be more scope for appreciation than depreciation . Some 45 percent of medium - risk Swiss - franc based accounts were denominated in that currency . " It is not a long - term strategy . It ' s a current strategy to have that much in Swiss francs because we believe the risk to the franc is on the upside , " he said . He based this partly on current talks for EMU , which have raised prospects of a broad membership at the start that would include countries such as Italy . - - Zurich Editorial , + 41 1 631 7340

AlphaNet plans Internet calls via telephone . AlphaNet Telecom Inc said on Thursday that it planned to begin offering in the first quarter of 1997 an international phone - to - phone voice and fax service using the Internet for long - distance transmission . The Toronto - based company said it will launch its AlphaNet Mondial service to users worldwide , offering them significant savings over rates charged by traditional telephone carriers . AlphaNet said it secured Internet network facilities and additional backing from Global One , the joint venture of Sprint Corp , Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom . The Global One ' s partners ' backbone networks will provide the transport for AlphaNet Mondial traffic internationally . At present , service originating out of a dozen countries is planned . Subscribers using the service would be able to call any phone or fax machine in the world , officials said . In a statement , AlphaNet chief executive Andre LeBel said that : " Large , medium and small companies , as well as individual consumers , will benefit from the substantial savings AlphaNet Mondial will offer . " " We anticipate being able to offer service at a fraction of the price charged today by the major long - distance carriers , " he said . LeBel is the former president of TeleGlobe Canada Inc , Canada ' s exclusive satellite telecommunications operator . The company claims its services can be delivered without sacrificing voice quality or the ease of dialing call . AlphaNet said that , unlike other " Internet telephone " systems that require a personal computer , AlphaNet Mondial uses standard telephones and fax machine equipment . IDT Corp , an internet access provider and pioneer of the international call - back industry , offers a system that allows computer users to place calls to standard telephones , but not full , phone - to - phone service . Dozens of software and hardware companies offer software to allow computer users to place phone calls over the Internet . The inherently low cost of Internet - based networks , combined with AlphaNet ' s proprietary compression technology , allows it to transport voice and fax calls at a considerably lower costs than traditional voice networks , the company said . " AlphaNet Mondial can be used by anyone who makes international telephone calls , or who sends faxes overseas , " said LeBel . The company said it has signed deal with major partners in Australia , New Zealand , Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan , South Korea and other countries . Arrangements with partners to distribute AlphaNet Mondial in additional countries are under negotiation , it said , including several in Europe , a spokesman said . Marketing in North America will be through a variety of channels and conducted in concert with one or more significant marketing partners . AlphaNet , which trades on the Toronto exchange under the ticker symbol " FAX , " is primarily known for the fax machine services it provides to hotel chains , a business in which it claims to hold 90 percent share of the world market . - - Eric Auchard , New York Newsdesk , 212 - 859 - 1736

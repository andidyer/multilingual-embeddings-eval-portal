U . N . mediator pessimistic on Israel - PLO talks . U . N . envoy Terje Larsen said on Friday that vital issues in talks between Israel and the Palestinians may not be resolved before the U . S . presidential elections a month from now . Larsen , who leaves for Israel on Sunday with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal in an effort to help get the peace process back on track , was pessimistic about early chances for a rapprochement . Asked by Norwegian NRK television if the peace process would stay on hold until after the U . S . elections , he said : " Let me put it this way - - I don ' t think it is very likely that they will be able to find a solution to the vital questions until a bit into November , and as you know the American presidential elections are on November 5 . " A two - day Washington summit ended on Wednesday with no agreement on major issues that led to fierce Israeli - Palestinian violence last week and threatened to undermine further the already battered peace process . The only tangible achievement of the summit - - declared a failure by Palestinian officials - - was an agreement for the two sides to resume talks on Sunday at the border crossing of Erez between Israel and the Palestinian self - rule area of Gaza . Larsen , a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the 1993 Israeli - Palestinian peace pact and now is seeking to mediate in the current crisis , said he was not even sure the talks on Sunday would take place . " One thing I have learned is that the only thing you can predict in the Middle East is that nothing is predictable , " he said grimly . " Nothing guarantees that the negotiations will start on Sunday . " In my opinion the talks they hopefully will enter are going to be very difficult and I don ' t think they are likely to find solutions to the central questions . . . in the forseeable future . " Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen said Godal would meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat separately . Godal would also visit the West Bank city of Hebron , where Norway keeps observers . " Given the role we have in general in the peace process we have a strong interest in getting the peace process on track again , " Havnen told Reuters . Larsen , who knows Arafat well , said : " I think Yasser Arafat has now reached a pain limit . The way the situation stands today I think it is politically impossible for him to accept a change in the text of the Oslo agreements . " The Israeli prime minister is of the opposite opinion and there is little to indicate that they will be able to find compromises in the next few days , or perhaps weeks , that both parties can live with .

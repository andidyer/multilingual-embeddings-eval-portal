FEATURE - Sarajevo sees rebirth among the ruins . On Sundays , Sarajevo families stroll down a pleasant tree - lined avenue that leads to the source of the river Bosna , paying little attention to an untidy heap of earth halfway along their route . Only the discarded lid of an old ammunition box provides a clue that the nondescript mound of mud and stones was once one of the most notorious choke points in the Serbs ' bitter siege of the Bosnian capital . A 20mm anti - aircraft cannon dug in on the edge of that cool leafy lane was perfectly placed for the Serb gunners to pick off slow - moving cars and trucks on the rocky track that led down the side of Mount Igman through the siege cordon into Sarajevo . " For five marks ( $ 3 ) I ' ll drive you along the avenue and you can take all the pictures you want , " said the driver of one of the tatty horse - drawn carriages that take visitors to the Bosna spring . The battered city has made a remarkable recovery in nearly two years of peace but the legacy of nearly four years of war will take some time to erase . Expensive restaurants patronised by diplomats and foreign aid workers have sprung up in buildings that still bear the scars of the shell fire that once made it impossible to get anywhere near them in safety . Pavements outside once - wrecked boutiques now stocked with chic Italian clothes are marked with the distinctive " bear ' s paw " craters left by exploding mortar bombs . Boulevard cafes have been taken over by warlords who made money on the black market during the siege years and now want to put up a legitimate front as the international community , chequebook open , begins the reconstruction of Bosnia . Video rental libraries have pirate copies of Hollywood films that are only just getting their first run in some European capitals . Sunlight glinting on the bright copper dome of the war - damaged central mosque is the most visible evidence of the rebuilding work . But around it are homes without roofs or windows , covered with sheets of protective plastic provided by the United Nations refugee agency flapping in the breeze . To see the city for the first time since the fighting stopped is a revelation , but if normal life is returning , it is coming back with a distinctive Sarajevo flavour . During the siege it could take a week to get a flight on an aid plane if shelling had closed the airport . Today it is possible to fly from London to Sarajevo in half a day on civil airliners . But when passengers emerge from the battered terminal building , unforeseen difficulties arise . Travellers without the right badge are forbidden to walk across to the car park by a monoglot French NATO soldier who says he is only following orders . That means everyone has to get into a bus with their luggage , drive 100 metres ( yards ) to the airport entrance , struggle out of the bus by the side of a muddy road and then find the people who have come to meet them . In the city , life is easier , with electricity and running water where once there was none . A recent power cut brought back memories for anyone nostalgic for the dark days of the siege . This time it was not enemy action that caused the lights to go out - - a rat had gnawed through a cable at the city power station . For anyone visiting Sarajevo for the first time since the outbreak of peace , one of the most striking sights is the view from the heights above the city . Street intersections which were killing grounds for snipers perched in tower blocks are criss - crossed by crowds of pedestrians who now only have to worry about being run over by the rush hour traffic . Outside the city , however , the grim work of digging up the thousands of war dead still buried in mass graves across Bosnia continues , with bodies being exhumed on virtually a daily basis . The International Committee of the Red Cross holds regular meetings to try to match the identities of the exhumed bodies with people on its list of missing persons . The latest " Working Group " session in Sarajevo identified 600 of the dead , which means death certificates can be issued to relatives , most of whom did not know what had become of their family members . " Their lives can now stop ricocheting between hope and despair , " said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Winquist - Galbe . " This is an important and positive step . " The number of the dead positively identified by the Red Cross was still no more than 800 by mid - October , while the number of missing registered with the agency has topped 15 , 000 and is still rising .

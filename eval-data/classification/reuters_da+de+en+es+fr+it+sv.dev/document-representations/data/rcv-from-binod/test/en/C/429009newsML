Lanica plans hostile bid for Co - Op assets - paper . Lanica Trust is preparing a hostile bid to buy the Co - Operative Wholesale Society Ltd ' s ( CWS ) non - food businesses , a British newspaper said on Sunday . The Sunday Telegraph said Andrew Regan , who runs Lanica , planned to approach CWS ' s 500 , 000 members directly and offer them up to 1 , 000 pounds ( $ 1 , 606 ) each if they backed the sale . Regan plans to have a resolution put to the CWS ' s annual meeting on May 17 to demand the board sell the businesses , which include petrol stations , undertakers , chemists , opticians and department stores , the paper said . In February , Lanica said a company in which it had an investment would approach CWS to discuss the possible purchase of non - food businesses . The CWS said at the time it had no plans to dispose of its businesses or assets to Lanica Trust or Andrew Regan . The Sunday Telegraph quoted a CWS spokesman as saying its core non - food businesses were not for sale . The CWS was taking legal advice on how to counter Lanica ' s hostile bid , the paper said .

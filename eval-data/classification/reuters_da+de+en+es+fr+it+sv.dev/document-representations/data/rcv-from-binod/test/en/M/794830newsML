IPE OIL FUTURES UP , GOOD TECHNICAL SUPPORT SEEN . IPE Brent crude and gas oil futures were slightly firmer in early trade on Tuesday . Traders said the market was fairly well supported with the bearishness of Iraqi oil sales already factored . Tom James at Credit Lyonnais Rouse said , " Now all the Iraqi news is out , technicals are taking hold of the market again " . Technical weight is provided by dynamic trendline support on the spot month continuation chart stemming from June 11 ' s $ 17 . 32 trough that comes in today at around $ 18 . 35 - 40 . By 0930 GMT Sept Brent was four cents up at $ 18 . 62 with Aug gas oil which expires at noon today 57 cents up at $ 168 . 75 . James said the market was still looking oversold in the short term and he expected to see a supported slightly stronger market today with some support coming from NYMEX products which were both holding key technical support levels . Traders remained overall bearish towards gas oil , but expected to see some support coming in with RSIs now in oversold territory and the $ 168 level is likely to put a fairly solid base in the market . - - Colin Wooster , London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 7456

Turkish MPs to discuss alleged state - mafia links . Turkey ' s parliament is set to debate alleged ties between the state and organised crime after a fatal accident linked a top security official and a gangster , state - run Anatolian news agency said on Sunday . A vote on whether to begin a parliamentary investigation will be held after Tuesday ' s speeches by the government and political parties , Anatolian said . The scandal unfolded after a mobster wanted for drug dealing and political killings died in the same car as a police chief and a former beauty queen in a traffic accident last weekend . Interior Minister Mehmet Agar resigned in the wake of the scandal , saying he wished to clear the way for a parliamentary investigation . Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and his deputy Tansu Ciller both denied any connection between the two matters . Agar ' s resignation automatically cancelled a left - wing party ' s call for a censure motion against him for failing to clear up the link between the senior policeman and car passenger Abdullah Catli , wanted in connection with heroin smuggling and the killing of leftists in the late 1970s . Turkish television had said Agar stayed in the same hotel as the crash victims in the Aegean Sea resort of Kusadasi a weekend earlier , suggesting he knew of any relationship among them . Seven pistols and two silencers were found in the car . An MP from Ciller ' s True Path Party , Sedat Bucak , was also in the car when it crashed in the western town of Susurluk . He is seriously injured in an Istanbul hospital where members of the well - armed Kurdish tribe which he heads were guarding him around the clock .

BOC lifts profits 11 pct despite health , stg . Industrial and medical gases specialist BOC Group Plc said on Tuesday that its full - year pre - tax profits jumped 11 percent to a record 444 . 9 million pounds ( $ 742 . 2 million ) , despite a weak performance at its health division and a stronger pound . The results were at the top end of market forecasts , which ranged from 421 to 445 million stg . Analysts had pared down their forecasts in recent months amid nerves over problems facing BOC ' s anesthetic and vacuum technology businesses , and the impact of the stronger pound . BOC said sterling ' s advance trimmed the rise in its fourth quarter pretax profits by three percentage points , to an overall gain of nine percent . The company , which declares dividends in advance , said it would pay a dividend for the year to September 1997 of 29 . 0 pence , a rise of 7 . 4 percent . Despite worries about the downturn in demand from the semi - conductor industry , the vacuum business , which helps provide super - clean environments for scientific and industrial customers , continued to be a star performer , with operating profits jumping 28 percent to 90 . 3 million pounds . But healthcare profits slipped 11 percent to 53 . 1 million pounds as generic competition continued to force down the price of its once top - selling anesthetic gas Forane . In the core industrial gases business operating profits rose 9 percent to 408 . 3 million pounds . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717 ( $ 1 = . 5994 Pound )

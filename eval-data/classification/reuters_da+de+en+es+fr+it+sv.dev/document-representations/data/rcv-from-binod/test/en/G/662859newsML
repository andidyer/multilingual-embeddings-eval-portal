NBA BASKETBALL - BULLS , CHICAGO CELEBRATE 5TH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP . Nearly a quarter million basketball fans celebrated the Chicago Bulls fifth world championship on Monday , with promises from the team that the remarkable victory string doesn ' t have to end .

Added co - captain Scottie Pippen : " We look forward to bringing it back for number six . So let ' s come back and get down for our triumph . " The sea of people greeting the team shouted " one more year , " a reference to the still uncertain status of Jordan , coach Phil Jackson and other players for next season . City officials said 225 , 000 people filled the area in front of a bandshell in Grant Park on the city ' s Lake Michigan waterfront , some arriving at daybreak in a steady rain to get close to the stage . The skies cleared not long before the team , carrying the five NBA championship trophies won in the last seven years , walked out on the stage . " My husband thought I was nuts , " Sarah Buncich , 54 , of St . John , Indiana , said . She had skipped work and left her home at 6 : 30 a . m . to come to the victory rally . One of her companions , Karen Kramer , 47 , also from St . John , said she was a celebrating everyone on the team but not sometimes bad - boy Dennis Rodman . " I teach second grade and I don ' t want those kids taking after him , " she said . Jordan , named the championship series most valuable player for the fifth time , said : " All of the players and all of the coaches and all of the people in the Bulls organisation want to say that this championship goes to all the working people of the city of Chicago . Every day , you ' re out there busting your butts and for two hours a night we try to give you something to cheer for . " Steve Kerr , whose tie - breaking basket on a pass from Jordan provided the edge in Friday ' s championship - clinching game against Utah , joked in recalling the moment . " When we called timeout , Phil ( Jackson ) asked Michael if he wanted to take the shot and Michael said he was feeling a little uncomfortable , " said Kerr . " Then Scottie said , ' In that commercial , Michael said he ' s missed 26 game - winning shots . Why don ' t we give it to Steve ? . ' " So I said , ' I guess I ' ve got to bail Michael out again ' , " Kerr sfaid . " It ' s my story and I ' m sticking to it . "

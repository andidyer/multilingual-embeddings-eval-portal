FORECAST - Dollar seen falling on fundamentals . The dollar , riding high on world foreign exchange markets , is expected to drop back versus the mark and yen as market focus switches to fundamentals , a Reuters survey showed on Tuesday . By mid - 1997 the dollar is expected to fall to 117 . 72 yen and 1 . 6463 marks , the mean of 16 forecasts collected on Tuesday showed . By end - 1997 the dollar is seen trading at 113 . 80 yen and 1 . 6167 marks . This compares with the dollar ' s levels in Europe on Tuesday at a 47 - month high versus the yen at around 120 . 75 and a 31 - month high of around 1 . 6565 against the mark . " We expect to see a slowdown in the U . S . later this year . Stronger growth in Europe should underpin the mark and potentially German rates are headed higher , " said Adam Chester , bond strategist at Yamaichi . " We don ' t think the Bank of Japan would want to see dollar / yen go decisively through 120 . Intervention is emerging at these levels to push the dollar lower " . The decline in the dollar against the yen is expected to be gradual but steady , according to the Reuters poll . By end - March , the dollar is expected to fall below 120 yen to 118 . 88 and by end - September , it is forecast to reach 116 . 00 . " We ' re coming up to March for the Japanese year - end . The yen will strengthen a little as repatriation comes through , " said David Hurd , a corporate dealer at Svenska Handelsbanken . " I ' m also not expecting any more liberalisation of the economy and this will push the yen up later this year " . Against the mark , the dollar ' s decline is expected to be slower . By the end of the first quarter of 1997 it is forecast at 1 . 6466 and by the end of the third quarter it is likely to fall to 1 . 6393 marks , the forecasts showed . Jeremy Hawkins , chief economist Europe at Bank of America , expects dollar / yen to rise to 125 before falling off to 112 by the end of this year . " The weakness in the Nikkei and the ongoing softness in the economy means that low interest rates are here for a while " . Fiscal and monetary policies in the United States , Japan and Germany are other reasons given for the dollar ' s reversal . " In the second quarter of 1997 , we are probably entering a period of monetary tightening in the United States , " said Philip Shaw , economist at UBS . " The main problem is the tight labour market and the Federal Reserve wanting to cool the pace of activity in the economy . They will also want to keep a lid on inflationary pressures " . Over the last two years , after the dollar fell below 80 in April 1995 to a post - war low against the yen , Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States has been declining . But many economists now believe that trend is about to reverse and the trade friction that is expected to follow will help the dollar to fall back against the yen . On a longer - term scale , Peter Von Maydell believes the mark has another couple of years to go through a multi - year correction against the dollar . He forecasts the dollar at 1 . 7500 marks from end - March to end - December . " After unification , fiscal policy was loosened and monetary policy tightened . It is the other way round now because they have to deal with their structural budget deficit . The policy mix will remain as it is for a couple of years . " - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 2737

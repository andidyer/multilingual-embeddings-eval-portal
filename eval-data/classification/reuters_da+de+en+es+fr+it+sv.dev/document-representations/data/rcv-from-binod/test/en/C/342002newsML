Northeast posts big loss for fourth quarter . Northeast Utilities Tuesday reported a much - larger - than - expected loss for the fourth quarter , due mainly to problems with its nuclear power plants . New England ' s biggest utility reported a fourth - quarter loss of $ 76 . 4 million , or 60 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 64 . 2 million , or 50 cents a share , in the fourth quarter of 1995 . Northeast attributed the weak results mainly to its nuclear woes , and said the 1996 figures included a $ 63 million accounting reserve to help pay for 1997 expenditures related to the company ' s nuclear programme . All three units at the Millstone nuclear power station in Waterford , Conn . , have been shut since March of last year amid safety concerns raised by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) . Northeast said last month it expected to have all three plants ready for restart by early 1998 , pending approval by the NRC . To compensate for the loss of nearly half of Connecticut ' s power generation , Northeast has been purchasing power at a cost of around $ 30 million a month . " We are hopeful of having at least one of the nuclear units back on line in the third quarter ( of 1997 ) , and that will go a long way toward improving our situation , " Northeast spokesman Tom Shiel said . Analysts said Northeast faced two huge challenges - - fixing its troubled nuclear operation , and coping with imminent electricity industry dereguation in New Hampshire , and eventually in Massachusetts and Connecticut . " They ' ve got two huge challenges in 1997 - - that ' s what makes the picture grim , " said Barry Abramson , analyst at Prudential Securities . " One of them will take a lot of money and time , " he said , referring to the company ' s efforts to restart its three Millstone nuclear plants . " The other is more uncertain - - how they can resolve the issue of being a large , high - cost producer in an industry that ' s about to be deregulated . "

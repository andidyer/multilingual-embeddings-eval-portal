Croatia Airlines waits for decision on supplier . Croatia Airlines , urgently trying to finalise its business plans for 1997 , is still waiting for a word from government on whether it should buy new planes from Boeing or Airbus , a company official said on Tuesday . Local newspapers reported the decision , which was to be reached in the summer , might be postponed till year - end . " With this delay I doubt we can get the first two aircraft next year , " sales and marketing vice president Kresimir Magdic told Reuters . " We might have to cancel all charter plans and only concentrate on regular traffic , " he added . Croatia Airlines had planned completely to renew its nine - plane fleet at the rate of two per year by 2000 . This would enable it to start overseas flights and expand business on existing routes within the country and Europe , while cutting operating costs . Magdic said the airline had no clear preference between Boeing and Airbus planes , and both companies offered more or less the same quality and terms . But another source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said a choice of supplier in a purchase worth millions of dollars had wider implications than one company ' s interests . It involved possible exports of Croatian goods in exchange for at least part of the deal and also meant Croatia ' s entire economic orientation for the next 20 years could veer towards America or Europe . Such a vital matter would probably be something for President Franjo Tudjman to decide on , the source said . Tudjman was last week admitted to the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington for treatment against what some U . S . sources described as a serious illness . But his own doctor and Croatian officials said the president was suffering from a stomach ulcer . Meanwhile , Magdic said the carrier was constantly in touch with both potential suppliers about the order . However , he pointed out they would find it hard to make a deadline for next year ' s delivery unless the matter was resolved soon and added : " I think we might have to postpone it all until 1998 .

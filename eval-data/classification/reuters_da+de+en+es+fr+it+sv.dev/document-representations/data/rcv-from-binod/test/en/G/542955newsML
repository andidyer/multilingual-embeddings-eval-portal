NBA BASKETBALL - JORDAN SINGLE - HANDEDLY STOPS BULLETS FOR PLAYOFF WIN . Michael Jordan took matters into his own hands Sunday , scoring 55 points including 20 of the Bulls ' 23 fourth - quarter points , as Chicago beat the Washington Bullets 109 - 104 for a 2 - 0 playoff series lead . Jordan extended his own record with his eighth career playoff game with 50 points or more , shooting 22 - of - 35 from the field and a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the free throw line . The Bulls can seal their sixth Eastern Conference first - round sweep in seven years with a win in Game Three on Wednesday , Washington ' s first home playoff game in nine years . " I just got into that mode and I couldn ' t get out of it , " Jordan said about his fourth - quarter scoring spree that saw him hit shots from all over the court . The Bullets , who led by seven points midway through the third quarter , had closed within a point when Jordan rattled off three straight baskets in a minute , giving the Bulls a 100 - 93 lead with 4 : 04 to go . The last one was remarkable , as he dribbled through the lane to the right baseline and launched a 10 - foot jumper as he was falling out of bounds . Calbert Cheaney , who guarded Jordan much of the game , scored 26 points , Tracy Murray added 22 off the bench and Chris Webber scored 21 for the Bullets , who threw a scare into the defending NBA champions but couldn ' t finish the job . " The Bullets are a fabulous team of the future , " Jordan said . " They are giving us a good run for our money . " Pippen scored 14 points and Harper 10 for the defending champion Bulls , who shot 53 percent ( 41 - of - 78 ) and missed just four of 27 foul shots . In Miami , the Heat administered a second successive embarrassing defeat to the Orlando Magic , pounding their intrastate rivals 104 - 87 to take a 2 - 0 lead in their Eastern Conference first - round series . Miami , which has never won a playoff series , can sweep the best - of - five affair with a win at Orlando in Game Three on Tuesday . " Our defence wore down on them and they couldn ' t stand up to it , " said Miami ' s P . J . Brown . " They didn ' t know what to do against our defence . " The Heat took early control for the second straight game , using a 22 - 3 burst at the start of the second quarter and building a 56 - 31 halftime lead . In Game One , Miami led 35 - 10 after one period and limited Orlando to just 64 points . " Today was a little surprising , " Heat guard Dan Majerle said . " We thought they would come out with fire in their eyes . They played a hard first quarter but our tenacity and conditioning wore them down . " P . J . Brown scored nine of his 17 points in the first - half burst and Tim Hardaway had 20 points and 11 assists for the second - seeded Heat . Penny Hardaway scored 26 points for the Magic , who are on the verge of being swept out of the playoffs for the fourth straight year . " It wasn ' t as bad as the first game . We got some positives that hopefully we can build on , " Penny Hardaway said . In Los Angeles , Shaquille O ' Neal scored 30 points as the hot - shooting Los Angeles Lakers raced to a 107 - 93 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers and a 2 - 0 lead in their Western Conference first - round series . O ' Neal , who scored a playoff career - high 46 points in Game One , was slowed down a bit , but not much . He shot 11 - of - 21 from the field and got some help from his teammates this time . " We knew that Game Two was going to be double critical for us , " O ' Neal said . " We let the lead slip away but we fought back . " Eddie Jones added 19 points for the Lakers , who shot 58 percent ( 36 - of - 62 ) from the field and used spurts at the start of the third and fourth quarters to dispose of the Trail Blazers . Los Angeles can complete a sweep of the best - of - five series with a win in Game Three at Portland on Wednesday . Rasheed Wallace scored 20 points - - two in the second half - - and Isaiah Rider and Kenny Anderson added 18 each for the Blazers , who were 3 - 1 against Los Angeles during the season . " We need to win three games and certainly we can do it , " Blazers coach P . J . Carlesimo said . " Absolutely we can do it , but it ' s going to be difficult . It ' s on us . "

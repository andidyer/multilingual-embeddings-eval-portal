Malaysia welcomes Singapore court ' s decision . Malaysia ' s foreign minister on Tuesday welcomed a Singapore court decision to delete remarks made by elder statesmen Lee Kuan Yew that had sparked a row between between the two neighbours . " If that is the case , then I think it is a good development , " Abdullah Badawi told reporters , adding he had not yet read the report . " Hopefully , this will lead to better ties between the two countries . " A Singapore High Court agreed on Monday to let former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew withdraw from an affidavit remarks that outraged Malaysia and sent its relations with Singapore into a tailspin . Lee , one of a dozen members of Singapore ' s ruling People ' s Action Party suing opposition politician Tang Liang Hong Tang for libel , had said in an affidavit it was irrational for Tung to flee to Johor Baru , a Malaysian city " notorious for shootings , muggings and car - jackings " . Lee , in a rare move , offered an unreserved apology in the face of Malaysian fury . When that proved insufficient to cool Kuala Lumpur ' s wrath , he promised to have the remark withdrawn from the affidavit . Malaysia said it would take time to heal the wound it said was inflicted when Lee questioned why Tang would flee to Johor Baru after a defeat in January ' s general elections . Tang said he had left Singapore after receiving death threats . Lee ' s promise appeared to end the crisis , but a report by a Singapore newspaper on Tuesday threatened to reignite the row . The pro - government Straits Times said it had analysed press reports of crime in the south Malaysian state of Johor and concluded Lee was justified in his perception . " An analysis of these reports shows that anyone reading them might well form a picture of Johor as being an unsafe place , " the newspaper said . Johor Baru is the capital of Johor state .

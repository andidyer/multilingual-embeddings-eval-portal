ALPINE SKIING - GIANT SLALOM WASHED OUT , OTHER RACES IN JEOPARDY . Steady rain throughout the night forced the postponement of a men ' s World Cup giant slalom Friday , and organisers rescheduled the race for Monday at the end of the four - race Park City programme . Continued rain on Friday and the forecast of wet , heavy snow falling in the evening , however , could threaten the entire programme . The unseasonable rain began about 9 p . m . Thursday and continued to pepper a race course already softened by warm temperatures and sunshine . A women ' s giant slalom was conducted under good conditions on Thursday , won by Sabina Panzanini of Italy . The revised schedule includes a women ' s slalom Saturday and a men ' s slalom Sunday , provided the weather and conditions cooperate . Race officials were working feverishly Friday to compact the snow and treat it with chemicals to restore the firm surface essential to racing . If the race course surface cannot be packed down sufficiently , the new wet snow that is expected could transform the course into a quagmire , threatening cancellation of the whole programme .

First Pacific unit to split share offer . First Pacific Co Ltd ' s Philippine based - Smart Communications is likely to offer the international tranche of its initial public offering sometime before the end of the year , said Executive Director Thomas Yasuda on Tuesday . Speaking at a Jardine Fleming Asia Conference in New York , Yasuda said that subject to the resolution of certain technical issues " we are likely to bifurcate the Smart offering and do the international piece sometime before the end of the year . " He pegged the value of the international offering at around $ 300 million and said it would be followed by a domestic IPO sometime by spring of next year . Smart Communications filed for an initial public offering in August this year . Yasuda said that Asia Link , the holding company for the group ' s telecom business , was the fastest growing of all the businesses . In the past year , it has ventured into the Indonesian , Chinese and Indian markets . In Indonesia , the company is currently in active talks with regional franchise distributors for the cellular market and may be in a position to make an announcement in the near future , Yasuda said . The Pacific Link unit which operates the group ' s telecom businesses has been awarded one of six Personal Communications Services ( PCS ) licenses in Hong Kong and is aggressively seeking to develop a PCS Network . Yasuda said the development costs would be funded from cash funds but the investment would " put some profit pressures on Pacific Link . " Going forward , Yasuda said profitability from the telecom business will probably not reach previous levels as start - up costs and market entry costs eat into earnings in the short run . " Days when there were no entry costs have gone , " he said and added that start - up costs associated with PCS development could mean a " growth rate that was flat or even negative over the next few years . " In answer to a question about whether the group would consider selling its Hagemeyer unit at a future date , Yasuda said " at this point we consider Hagemeyer a core company . We are encouraging them to refocus to capture growth in Asia . " " If it happens , we ' ll be more comfortable with the long - term holdings . If not , we ' ll see . " Earlier in the presentation , the company ' s group Financial Controller , Paul Wallace had said that " Hagemeyer will probably be able to manage low teen growth in EPS . " Hagemeyer is a trading house which is part of the group ' s marketing and distribution sector . - - New York Newsdesk 212 - 859 - 1610

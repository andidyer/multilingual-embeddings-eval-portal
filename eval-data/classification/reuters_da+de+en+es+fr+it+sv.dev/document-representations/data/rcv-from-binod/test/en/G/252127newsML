Former rebels back Cambodian co - premier Hun Sen . Thousands of former Khmer Rouge rebels on Thursday pledged their support to Cambodian co - Premier Hun Sen , who led a triumphant tour of their northwestern base . Analysts said the reception for Hun Sen , who was greeted with signs reading " Hun Sen is the best man for peace , " was the most partisan display yet by the guerrillas , who defected to the government in early November . " We completely support Hun Sen . We would like to support the policies of the government , especially the policies of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen , who is with the people all the time , " said Commander Ieng Pharn , who leads more than 4 , 500 former Khmer Rouge troops in the area . Ieng Pharn said about 1 , 500 of the soldiers and hundreds of their family members turned out to greet Hun Sen , who had persuaded the rebels to defect via a general loyal to the co - premier . A military observer estimated about 1 , 800 former guerrillas , dressed in government uniforms , and about 200 family members attended the reception ceremony . Hun Sen , who was accompanied by a large entourage of foreign diplomats , leading business people , top military brass and the director of the national bank , made a significant show of political strength at the ceremony , analysts said . " He was well - accompanied , " said one Western military observer . " It showed that all the top officials from his party are still behind him , and it shows the strength of his position . The region seems to be one hundred percent pro - Hun Sen . " Signs supporting Hun Sen ' s ex - communist Cambodian People ' s Party ( CPP ) were hanging outside most houses during Hun Sen ' s visit . " I come here with a good feeling , " Hun Sen told the crowds . " We must put the weapons away and try to develop the country . " He later pledged to build 10 schools in the area and a road to Battambang , Cambodia ' s second largest city located about 80 kms ( 50 miles ) northeast of Samlaut . Hun Sen ' s show of strength comes amid a rapid deterioration in his relationship with co - Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh in recent weeks as the two leaders have competed for the loyalty of Khmer Rouge defectors . The ceremony in Samlaut was likely to intensify their rivalry , analysts said . The Khmer Rouge , which led the brutal 1975 - 1979 " killing fields " regime , has been ravaged in recent months by mass defections to the government side . The hardline Maoist guerrillas are estimated to have been reduced to about 800 to 2 , 000 fighters , mostly in the jungle base of Anlong Veng in the northwest . The Samlaut area is the site of a 1967 peasant revolt that some historians say launched the Khmer Rouge ' s armed struggle . After being forced from power by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979 , the Khmer Rouge fought a Hanoi - installed regime before signing a U . N . - brokered peace treaty with three rival factions in 1991 . They later reneged on the treaty and have been fighting the current coalition since it was installed following 1993 elections .

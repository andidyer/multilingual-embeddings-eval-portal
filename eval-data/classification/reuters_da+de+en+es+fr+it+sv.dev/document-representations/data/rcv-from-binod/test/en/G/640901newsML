EU / U . S . deal on mutual standards still elusive . The European Union and the United States remained at odds Thursday over a final deal on mutual recognition of safety standards for a variety of products ranging from pharmaceuticals to pleasure boats . " There are some signs of backsliding on the U . S . side , " European Commission spokesman Peter Guilford told a news conference . He said the U . S . Food and Drug Administration appeared unhappy about last week ' s draft deal on mutual recognition agreements , or MRAs . " The FDA seems to want to go back on some parts of the pre - agreement , " he said . A U . S . mission official declined to comment on Guilford ' s remark about backsliding , saying only : " We agree with the EU that we are close to reaching an MRA . We do not see any problems in the current negotiations . " U . S . President Bill Clinton announced a breakthrough in talks on MRAs after last week ' s meeting in the Hague with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok and European Commission President Jacques Santer . Clinton said he hoped for a deal " within a few days " after negotiators had put together a last - minute agreement following failed talks in Paris . News of the breakthrough surprised many on the EU side , who said such movement was impossible without EU negotiators ' prior consultation with national capitals . Guilford said EU countries ' trade officials were due to discuss the issue on Friday . " There are still residual negotiations going on with the U . S . to reduce the ( draft ) text and , clearly , we want to give member states the opportunity to discuss this with their industries , " he said . Officials say a deal on MRAs , which would also cover telecommunications equipment , medical devices and information technology products , would cut costs in sectors worth a combined $ 40 billion annually .

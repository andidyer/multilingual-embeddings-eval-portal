The Proteus Column - Holocaust . . THE PROTEUS COLUMNAll insurance companies at some time have their public relations crises to deal with - but few can be as complex and as sensitive as the insurers facing allegations they benefited from the Holocaust . Yesterday Germany ' s Allianz agreed to talk to the Jewish community in France which had earlier threatened to boycott the company . This is a blow for an insurer which wants to fight its main European rival Axa on its own doorstep and only last week formally announced its interest in soon - to - be privatised French insurer GAN . Allianz was surprised by the boycott call in view of its actions to deal with the issue . It had launched a campaign and a telephone hotline to help relatives of Holocaust victims track down assets after having been named in a U . S . lawsuit along with six other insurers . A few days earlier Allianz had also come under the spotlight in German news magazine Der Spiegel , which reported it was among insurers which profited from victims and Nazis alike - - earning money on the insurance of deported Jews and the policies for the forced - labour companies run by the SS . Allianz acknowledged insuring SS weapons factories and prisoners ' barracks , material stores and vehicles in the concentration camps from 1940 to 1945 , and that representatives regularly inspected the factory halls . In March Italian insurer Generali ' s plans to acquire Israel ' s Leumi insurance were overshadowed by accusations that Generali has failed to honour life insurance policies taken out by people who died in the Holocaust . Others such as France ' s AGF and Swiss Re subsidiary Bavarian Re have also become embroiled in the issue , and have been forced to take some kind of strategy to deal with it . Bavarian Re last week said it had been dropped from the law suit , but was careful to note in a statement that " the plaintiffs ' request has our respect " . Later this month Switzerland ' s Winterthur is sponsoring a conference " Property and Restitution - the Responsibility towards History " in Geneva . From a financial point of view , the lawsuit must be taken seriously , as the plaintiffs ' lawyers say claims could run into billions of dollars . However , the public relations impact is vitally important to insurers . Demonstrations against commercial and industrial conglomerates have shown how potent they can be in undermining trust and respect for a company name no matter how well established . That trust is crucial in insurance . The success these companies have in responding to the challenge of keeping their reputations untarnished will be a measure of their calmness and compassion under pressure . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE PROTEUS COLUMN is an insight piece produced by Reuters journalists based on their own research and interpretations .

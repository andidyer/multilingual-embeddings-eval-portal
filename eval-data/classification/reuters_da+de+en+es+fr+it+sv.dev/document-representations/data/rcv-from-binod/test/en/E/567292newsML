UK manufacturing still blighted by rampant pound . A modest fall in manufacturing output in March highlighted the skewed nature of Britain ' s economic recovery , leaving economists hoping for fiscal rather than monetary tightening to restore an even keel . Britain ' s beleaguered manufacturers have had to cope with a stellar increase in the pound - - up 19 percent on a trade - weighted basis since last August - - pushing up their prices and compounding weakness in European markets . " It ' s still a tale of two economies , " said Stephen Hannah , head of research at IBJ International . " Manufacturing is being hurt by the strength of sterling . " Official figures showed a 0 . 1 percent fall in manufacturing output in March . That could be written off as a short - term blip but output in the first quarter is only 1 . 6 percent higher than in the same quarter last year . Meanwhile , consumer spending is rocketing up at about four percent on an annual basis . " Services are remarkably strong and that represents the bulk of our activity , " Hannah said . " That indicates that further policy moves will have to be dictated to moderating the household sector . " That means tax rather than interest rate rises . Having raised base rates by a quarter - point to 6 . 25 percent on Tuesday , Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will now hold a budget within two months . Economists say it is the household sector that needs restraining and that requires tightening of personal taxes . Despite Brown ' s pledge to leave the rates of income tax unchanged and not to extend VAT , Hannah said there was plenty of scope to increase personal taxation . Brown could tighten the personal allowances on which no income tax is paid . He could also cut , or abolish , tax relief on home loan payments , Hannah said . Looking at the breakdown of Wednesday ' s figures , David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy , said key export sectors like chemicals were obviously suffering . Output of chemicals and man - made fibres dropped by 0 . 2 percent in the first quarter of the year . " Now that monetary policy is out of Mr Brown ' s hands , the most likely away of addressing this problem is would be to tighten fiscal policy and take some of the upward pressure off the currency , " Coleman said . Of course , now Brown has given the Bank of England operational independence over interest rates , monetary policy could be tightened further despite the pound ' s strength . The Bank has long maintained that to regard a strong currency as a de facto monetary tightening is dangerous . But that would hurt manufacturing more if yesterday ' s rate rise is anything to go by . Sterling leapt about three pfennigs against the mark afterwards . And , as Hannah pointed out , not only would output be hit but high street spending could rise even faster as a further jump by sterling would cut import prices . The end result would be an even more skewed economy . Jonathan Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets , agreed another rate rise could be disastrous . " While it is too early to say whether the manufacturing recovery has ground to a halt , these figures serve as a timely reminder that industry needs more rises in interest rates . . . like a hole in the head . " He said there could be worse to come for manufacturing whether base rates stayed put or not . The full impact of sterling ' s rally has yet to be felt he said , noting that the Confederation of British Industry ' s latest industrial trends survey showed a sharp fall in business confidence . Industrial production figures , released alongside the manufacturing numbers , which represent the output of manufacturing and energy industries , showed only a 0 . 1 percent rise in output in the first quarter . Warm weather cut demand for gas and electricity in March . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5109

Sony half - year profits triple , sales surge . Sony Corp . ' s profits tripled in the first half of the year , boosted by robust sales in its electronics and entertainment divisions , and the diversified media group said Thursday it expects the upward swing to continue . " Our business was better than we initially thought . Actually it was extremely good , " a Sony spokesman said . Sony ' s net income , which included that of Sony and its units worldwide , leaped to 51 . 74 billion yen ( $ 461 million ) in the half - year to Sept . 30 . Sony ' s units include Sony Pictures Entertainment , which groups Columbia and Tri - Star Pictures , and Sony Music Entertainment , which has recording contracts with artists including Mariah Carey , Michael Jackson and Celine Dion . The group ' s revenues in the half - year rose 23 percent to 2 . 53 trillion yen ( $ 22 . 5 billion ) . Sony said it expects the upward trend to continue , and forecast its group operating profit would reach a record 305 billion yen ( $ 2 . 72 billion ) for the full business year , which ends on March 31 . " The rise in profit and sales was due to good performances at our electronics division and entertainment division . Sales of hardware and software helped each other to push up our overall sales , " the Sony spokesman said . The yen ' s weakening against foreign currencies also contributed to Sony ' s group earnings , because a drop in the yen boosts foreign currency - denominated revenue when it is converted into yen . A large part of the Sony group ' s revenue is in foreign currency . In the electronics division , the largest year - on - year rise in sales in the half - year period was marked by mobile phones and videogame machines , which jumped 34 . 5 percent . Sony ' s 32 - bit PlayStation home videogame players were a key factor , the company said . Sony said in October that global shipments of the PlayStations as of the end of October totalled nine million units , and that the company was boosting output of the players . In the entertainment business , sales grew due to the weak yen as well as strong sales , especially in the music group . There were still problems in the long - troubled motion picture group however . " In the picture group , some of the films in the half - year period did not do well . But the picture group ' s video and television business was strong , " the Sony spokesman said . Industry analysts say Sony Pictures has struggled to achieve the same performance as its peers , with a big part of its profits coming from television rather than feature films . Box office performance of its films " The Cable Guy , " " The Fan " and " Multiplicity " this summer was disappointing , they said . However , the Sony spokesman said video sales of " Jumanji " and " Sense and Sensibility " were strong in the half - year . In October Sony named a new management team for Sony Pictures headed by John Calley , president of United Artists Pictures . " We expect the company ' s film business to improve under the new president , " the spokesman said .

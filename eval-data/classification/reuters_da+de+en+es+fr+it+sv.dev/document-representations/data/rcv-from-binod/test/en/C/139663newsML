FOCUS - BAA told to cut London airport rates . Britain ' s Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) on Thursday ruled that airport operator BAA Plc must cut the charges it levies against airlines for using London ' s two main airports , Heathrow and Gatwick . The CAA ordered the BAA to cut charges by three percentage points below inflation each year for five years . Calling its formula comparatively benign , the CAA said it aimed to encourage BAA to go ahead with plans to double capacity at Heathrow to over 100 million passengers a year by building a fifth terminal costing more than 1 . 5 billion pounds ( $ 2 . 39 billion ) . BAA said the new formula was " workable " but challenging . It had asked to be allowed to increase charges in line with inflation but now faced losing 150 million pounds in expected airline income over the next five years . Finance director Russell Walls told a news conference that BAA would now seek ways to further improve retail revenues and to cut costs to make up for the missed revenue . He said the task was challenging , but he noted that regulated charges at BAA ' s three London airports bring in some 360 million pounds a year , accounting for only 28 percent of the group ' s total revenues of around 1 . 25 billion last year . Retail income rose 10 . 5 percent last year to 556 million pounds , making airport shopping BAA ' s biggest single earner . He said that figure was set to grow following a sharp expansion in shopping facilities at BAA ' s seven British airports . " We are always growing our retail side of the business and it won ' t be long before retail accounts for more than 50 percent of our business , " he said on Thursday . BAA ' s share price jumped 10 - 1 / 2 pence to 515 - 1 / 2 on the CAA news , bucking a weak market on relief the new formula , which takes effect from April , was not more demanding . The CAA ruled that charges at Heathrow and Gatwick be cut in real terms by the official Retail Price Index ( RPI ) measure of inflation minus three percentage points a year for five years . But it can raise charges at the much smaller Stansted airport by the RPI plus one percent . The CAA said current airline user charges average 4 . 60 pounds per passenger at Heathrow and 3 . 61 pounds at Gatwick . Under the RPI minus three percent formula , the price differential will widen by one percentage point a year , to reflect the need for more investment at Heathrow . The current five - year formula , which runs out next April , imposed annual price changes ranging from RPI minus eight percent in the first two years , RPI minus four in 1994 / 95 and RPI minus one in 1995 / 96 and 1996 / 97 . The CAA said the new regime could have been tougher and it had talked of imposing a much tougher formula of RPI minus eight percent a year for the five years to 2002 followed by a sharp hike in 2002 - 2007 of RPI plus 13 . 5 percent to take account of new investment . The CAA and BAA said that most of its airline customers had agreed with the RPI minus three formula . " The airlines . . . felt that the RPI - 3 formula would avoid the need for large and possibly unachievable increases after 2002 , once Terminal 5 is opened , " the CAA said in a statement . " The airlines all supported this ( agreed ) formula because when it came to the crunch they all want this infrastructure investment , " said Des Wilson , BAA ' s director of public affairs . BAA says it does not now expect a government decision on Terminal Five before late 1998 , since the public planning inquiry hearings are likely to run on until the end of 1997 . The CAA warned that if the project failed to go ahead there would have to be a mid - term review of the new pricing formula . ( $ 1 = . 6285 Pound )

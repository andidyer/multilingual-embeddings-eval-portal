Firefighters shield 100 homes from forest blaze . Firefighters on Wednesday successfully shielded some 100 homes from a forest fire that threatened a subdivision in this Atlantic County township overnight . A spokesman for the state Forest Fire Service said the flames were contained within a 2 , 000 - acre perimeter of brush and wetland . One firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion , but no other injuries were reported . Safety authorities had evacuated 100 homes in a development called Totem Villege , but scores of residents defied the order to protect their homes with garden hoses . The fire began about 4 : 30 p . m . EDT Tuesday in the Wharton State Forest and its plume of smoke could be seen 30 to 40 miles , as far away as Philadelphia and Trenton . It was the second major fire in as many weeks in the vast scrub forest called the Pine Barrens - - much of it a state wildlife preserve . On July 19 flames destroyed 800 acres but spared two retirement communities in Ocean County .

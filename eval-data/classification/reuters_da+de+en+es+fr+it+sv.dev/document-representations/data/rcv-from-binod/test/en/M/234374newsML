US Midwest spot propane prices leap near 7 - yr high . Propane prices in the U . S . midcontinent were near seven - year highs Wednesday afternoon amid fears homeowners may run out of the key heating fuel when winter sinks its teeth into the nation ' s heartland . But as prices hovered within six cents of the $ 1 . 00 mark reached Tuesday - - triple levels a year ago - - other traders said stock fears had pushed them to unreasonable heights . " It seems like there ' s a lot of hype in the market . Prices seem overvalued , " one Midwest trader said , adding players were awaiting fresh weekly data Wednesday to better gauge stocks . Propane for prompt delivery at the Midwest trading hub of Conway , Kansas , was offered at 94 . 00 cents a gallon at midday Wednesday , with parcels for late - December delivery sold at 97 . 25 cents in the morning , traders said . Conway prices jumped an electrifying 15 cents a gallon on Tuesday , traders said , on the heels of new American Petroleum Institute data showing a large Midwest stock drop in October . They said the monthly API report , released this week , estimated Midwest stocks by late October had fallen over 3 . 5 million barrels from late September - - leaving only about 12 . 5 million in primary storage . Midwest stocks have been battered by an early Midwest cold snap last month and sharp demand from farmers for drying a late corn crop - - exacerbated by the oil industry ' s recent drive to minimize inventories in order to free up working capital . Some players speculate the region ' s propane stocks may have shrunk another two to four million barrels since late October , leaving current primary stocks at barebones levels . But others said stocks are not low enough to justify current Midwest prices that are triple the 33 . 00 - cent deals seen this time last year , and the highest since the $ 1 . 10 - per - gallon summits reached during the 1989 price spike . " Inventories are low , but not inordinately bad , " one Midwest trader said , expressing surprise prices have blown out so dramatically even before the beginning of winter . On the Gulf Coast , spot propane at the trading hub of Mont Belvieu , Texas , remained about 71 . 00 cents , traders said , after rising 1 . 50 cents Tuesday in sympathy with Conway ' s blustering strength . " That ' s more than double this time last year , " one trader in the Gulf Coast " Refinery Row " said Wednesday , recalling the 31 . 00 - cent propane offered early last December . The latest API report showed October Gulf Coast stocks rising a million barrels over the prior month , traders said . Nationwide , API pegged total propane stocks in primary storage at about 49 . 5 million barrels at the end of October , traders said , about six million lower than prior year levels . The U . S . propane price drama comes amid a backdrop of current decade - high prices in Asia for liquified petroleum gas ( LPG ) , the catch - all industry term for propane and butane . The fuel is used for home heating as well as feedstocks for the petrochemical industry ' s plastic products . Saudi Arabia , the world ' s largest LPG exporter , has hiked its prices for December propane to $ 310 a tonne - - or 59 . 4 cents a gallon . That is its priciest level in a decade and more than $ 100 a tonne , or 19 cents a gallon , higher than a year ago . " The price rise has prompted retailers and wholesalers to seriously consider adjusting domestic prices , which have never been changed for the past 10 to 15 years , upwards , " an LPG trading source in Japan told Reuters . - - New York Energy Desk , 212 - 859 - 1632

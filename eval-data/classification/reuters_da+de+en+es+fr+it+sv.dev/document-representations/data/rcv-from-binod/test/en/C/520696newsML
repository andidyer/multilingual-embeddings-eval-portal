Great Western challenges Ahmanson merger . Great Western Financial Corp . Friday said the California State Banking Department has told the thrift the state ' s banking laws do not allow mergers such as the one H . F . Ahmanson & Co . has proposed . Great Western said restructuring the proposed merger to comply with California banking laws would require Ahmanson to file new regulatory applications , which could hold up the proposed merger and prevent timely achievement of cost savings . Ahmanson , parent company of Home Savings of America , in February launched a hostile bid for Great Western worth about $ 5 . 9 billion in stock . Great Western rejected the hostile bid and announced a friendly merger with Seattle - based Washington Mutual Inc . , orth about $ 5 . 7 billion in stock . Unlike the Ahmanson proposal , which involves the merger of a thrift with a non - California bank , Great Western said Washington Mutual ' s deal would be a merger between two thrifts . Representatives from the California State Banking Department and Ahmanson were not immediately available for comment . Ahmanson ' s stock fell 62 . 5 cents to $ 36 , Washington Mutual slid 62 . 5 cents to $ 46 . 625 and Great Western edged down 12 . 5 cents to $ 40 . 375 on the New York Stock Exchange .

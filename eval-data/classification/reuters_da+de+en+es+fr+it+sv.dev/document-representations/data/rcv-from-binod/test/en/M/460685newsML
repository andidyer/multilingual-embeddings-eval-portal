The uptrend looked safe while the contract stayed above a chart gap extending from 989 to 982 which is a crucial support level , they said . Traders called the market five stg up following sharp gains in New York . This would lift May immediately to the resistance level . " If it can break above that the market will look really good , " said Darren Gurner , technical analyst at Sucden . If 1 , 035 was cleared , May would head towards a test of the latest peak of 1 , 048 stg , which is a seven - month high , and then to 1 , 052 and the contract high of 1 , 075 . London ' s May made a double - top at 1 , 033 on Thursday but finished off its peak at 1 , 031 stg , 16 stg higher on the day . Although the RSI was still pointing to overbought , signalling further consolidation Gurner said : " In these kind of markets one can pretty well ignore this . It looks like everybody wants to be long of this market . " He expected the market to move sideways to higher in the coming days . Elli Gifford , technical analyst at Investment Research of Cambridge , said whilst support held at 980 , challenge to the critical resistance of 1 , 048 - 50 was likely to continue . " However , only if it were cleared would it be possible to put other upside targets in place , " she said in a daily report . New York cocoa prices ended sharply higher in a sudden burst of speculative buying on Thursday after an initial pull back . The CSCE May ended $ 42 higher a tonne at $ 1 , 473 . A projected supply deficit this year and forecasts of continuing dry weather in Ivory Coast ' s cocoa belt over the next few days were viewed as supportive , although cocoa trees show little evidence of being stressed , some analysts said . - - Clelia Oziel , London Newsroom + 44 - 171 - 542 8072

" There is not much fresh corporate news so we are looking elsewhere for impulses . Right now that is EMU worries . " Despite the concerns , some traders said the market may seek to again push above 3 , 700 points in the DAX index and take advantage of a firmer dollar and overnight Wall Street gains to push the DAX toward its all - time high at 3 , 724 . 96 points .

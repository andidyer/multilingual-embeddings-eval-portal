SIMEX Nikkei futures end firmer in thin trade . SIMEX Nikkei futures finished firmer in thin trade on Friday as participation was limited after a Japanese holiday and ahead of the weekend . The benchmark Nikkei 225 June contract ended 125 points higher at 18 , 555 after touching a peak of 18 , 610 . Market turnover was 8 , 010 lots . " It ' s a Friday and yesterday was a holiday . Nobody was doing anything today , " said a trader with a Japanese futures house . He said players were also likely to remain cautious ahead of Tuesday ' s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting , particularly after Fed chief Alan Greenspan repeated the need for the central bank to be pre - emptive in its fight against inflation on Thursday . " It ' s the third time he ' s talked about raising rates and I think they ' ll have to do it at next week ' s FOMC , " the trader said . " In this environment , I don ' t think anyone wants to buy stocks . " The prospect of a U . S . rate hike usually triggers market fears of the Bank of Japan following suit to prevent the yen weakening too sharply . The trader said the June Nikkei would need to breach resistance around 18 , 700 in order to climb above 19 , 000 . " As long as it stays above 18 , 200 , it should bounce around in a 500 - point range unless either side breaks , " he added . - - Sonali Desai ( 65 - 8703090 )

LME copper breaks above $ 2 , 000 level . A burst of investment bank buying and shortcovering pushed the benchmark three months delivery London Metal Exchange ( LME ) copper price up to $ 2 , 008 a tonne level at the end of the Thursday morning pre - market session . The move represented a near $ 40 a tonne gain from Wednesday ' s close but traders did not see it as particularly significant as the market was still well within its recent $ 1 , 950 to $ 2 , 040 trading range . " There was no news behind the rise which was mainly influenced by technical factors , " said Martin Squires at brokers Rudolf Wolff . Support held around the $ 1 , 950 / $ 1 , 960 a tonne range on Wednesday which prompted shortcovering and some bank buying in the morning , he said , while pointing out that the market was thin . Stoploss buying at $ 1 , 985 and $ 2 , 000 fuelled the advance but the target of the recent high of $ 2 , 042 may not be reached on this spike as producer selling will likely provide considerable resistance , traders said . The market was awaiting Friday ' s LME stock report to see if copper continues to flow out of warehouses at the same rate as during recent weeks . London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 7771

Briton hails gene - therapy step in cystic fibrosis . A top British geneticist said on Wednesday that he and colleagues had taken a first step towards gene therapy by using genes to treat cystic fibrosis patients . Dr Chris Higgins , chair of clinical biochemistry at Oxford University , said the tests showed the technique was safe . The hereditary disease , usually appearing in infancy or childhood , impairs breathing and digestion . Eight volunteers with cystic fibrosis were given one dose of normal genes to counteract the genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis . Six of them were cured , temporarily , of the debilitating symptoms of the disease . " It worked , " Higgins said . Higgins said the technique used was not strictly gene therapy . " What we are really doing is gene transfer , not gene therapy . But we believe it can also have clinical benefit . " True gene therapy would involve permanently altering a patient ' s genes , not just the genes in a cell that will eventually die . No one has done it yet . Higgins ' group delivered normal DNA to existing cells . To make a more permanent change , stem cells , which give birth to other cells , would have to be changed . A step further would involve germ cells - - which would permanently alter a person ' s DNA and allow them to pass on the changes to their children . " Not only is germ - line therapy not possible , but in many countries , like this one , it is not legal either , " Higgins told a conference organised by Britain ' s Royal Society - - the country ' s academy of sciences - - on the moral , legal and ethical questions of gene therapy . Higgins , who said he was preparing to publish his findings , said the important part was that the therapy was safe . " It did no harm , no damage whatsoever , " he said . But it only worked for three weeks , which did not surprise Higgins . He said the experiment delivered therapeutic genes into the nose , where cells are renewed frequently . Higgins ' team is now analysing the results of a trial involving multiple doses , which could have long - term effects . One in 20 people of European descent carries the cystic fibrosis gene . CF is one of the most commonly inherited genetic diseases and it is a favourite target for gene therapy . The CF gene , identified and cloned in 1989 , affects an iron channel - - an opening in the cell membrane that lets chloride , essential to cell function , in and out of the cell . That is why cystic fibrosis affects so many different organs , causing a buildup of mucus in the lungs and interrupting digestion . Most efforts towards gene therapy use viruses . Viruses work by injecting their own genetic material , either RNA or DNA , into a victim cell . They can be manipulated to deliver the correct gene instead , and are extremely efficient . But viruses can also be dangerous , and the body often develops an immune response that counteracts any good . So Higgins ' team is working with liposomes , fatty molecules that can bind to the cell membrane . They can be manipulated to incorporate whatever DNA the scientists want to deliver to cells , although they are less efficient than viruses . The volunteers were given a nasal drip of the genetically modified liposomes . The target was the epithelial cells that line the nose . Tests were then done to see whether the cells of the volunteers were working normally . They were . " We can deliver the DNA , it functions , it makes the protein , the protein works , " Higgins said . But he estimated it would be 10 years before true gene therapy was possible . " We are going to have to get a lot of smart science done , a lot of investment . There are going to be no quick fixes . "

Poll scandal rattles Romania ahead of elections . A scandal over an opinion poll has inflamed passions in Romania just a month ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections . Opposition leaders have accused President Ion Iliescu ' s Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) of dirty tricks and one called the scam a " Romanian Watergate . " The row has blown up over the way in which the PDSR was allegedly conducting an internal opinion poll . The opposition claims pollsters were phoning voters and asking loaded questions , intended to put them off voting for Iliescu ' s rivals . The flashpoint came late on Monday when reporters entered the offices of the polling institute and filmed panicked workers trying to conceal phone books and questionnaires . A video tape of the raid has been shown repeatedly on Romanian private television stations and the Association of Romanian Journalists has accused the PDSR of " dirty electioneering " . The ruling party has conceded some of the questions put to voters were " a bit less than usual " but denied wrongdoing . It has asked police to probe what it called the " commando " operation . Trying to defuse the controversy , Iliescu ' s spokesman Traian Chebeleu said on Thursday the issue had been " exaggerated by certain newspapers for electoral purposes . " Romania is the only East European country where former communists retained power after the 1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc . Latest opinion polls show Iliescu ' s PDSR trailing the opposition ahead of the third post - communist presidential and parliamentary elections due on November 3 . Independent pollsters question the ethics of the controversial PDSR poll , which blasts Iliescu ' s main rivals , academic Emil Constantinescu of the opposition Democratic Convention bloc and Romania ' s first post - communist prime minister Petre Roman . One question in the poll allegedly asked : " Constantinescu said he would bring ex - King Michael back to the throne if he is elected president . How does that affect your confidence in him ? " Another said : " If you knew that Roman ' s wife had asked to be named prime minister in January 1990 , on grounds that her husband was unfit for the job , how would your confidence in Roman be affected ? " The video tape was shot as part of an investigation into the PDSR campaign run by the journalists ' association with help from the December 21 Association , which groups fighters in the December 1989 revolt which ousted Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu . PDSR leaders say the party commissioned the opinion survey from IUP - - an obscure polling institute operating from offices rented in a building once used by Ceausescu ' s powerful wife Elena - - to gauge their popularity ahead of November ' s polls . The party , which fared poorly in local elections in June , has repeatedly denied the dirty tricks accusations . But the opposition has the bit between its teeth . " This is a Romanian Watergate , " said Radu Vasile , spokesman for the National Peasant Party , backbone of the Convention .

Earthquake dust clouds found to cause illness . The 1994 Los Angeles earthquake unleashed a fungus into the air that triggered an outbreak of respiratory infections that killed three people , researchers said on Tuesday . In the seven weeks following the Jan . 24 quake , there were 203 cases of coccidioidomycosis in Ventura County downwind from the quake ' s epicenter in Northridge . The cause of the outbreak , which peaked two weeks after the quake , was a fungus with sporelike cells that was dislodged from the topsoil and inhaled from dust clouds , researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta said . Coccidioidomycosis is commonly known as valley fever , or San Joaquin Valley fever , because the fungus , Coccidiodes immitus , is found mostly in the topsoil of semi - arid areas of the U . S . Southwest , Mexico and Central and South America . Residents who reported being in a dust cloud after the Northridge quake and its aftershocks were three times more likely to be diagnosed with an acute form of the infection , and the risk increased with the time spent breathing the dust . In the report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , Eileen Schneider of the Centers for Disease Control urged that those caught in an earthquake try to avoid areas of heavy dust . She said clinicians should be made aware that early diagnosis and treatment of the infection can forestall dangerous complications .

Canadian T - bills open weaker , eye on Fed decision . Canadian T - bills opened weaker in quiet trading on Tuesday with the market keenly awaiting a decision from the U . S . Federal Reserve on whether to hike U . S . interest rates , dealers said . " Basically it ' s 50 - 50 out there whether the Fed is going to move , " said a T - bill dealer with one bank - owned brokerage . " People are thinking if anything we ' ll consolidate here if not back up on a Fed move . " Canada ' s three - month when - issued T - bill softened to yield 3 . 11 percent from 3 . 08 percent at Friday ' s close . The Fed ' s rate - setting Open Market Committee is expected to announce near 1415 EDT / 1815 GMT whether they will hike U . S . interest rates for a second time this year . Economists are divided on the likely outcome because despite strong growth , there are few signs of inflation in the U . S . In Canada , T - bill trading has remained quiet and mostly dealer driven ahead of the Fed decision , with many traders unwilling to place bets . " People want to stay fairly close to home or where they went out on Friday . I don ' t think they are going to be strapping any major positions on , " the dealer said . The dealer said the Bank of Canada is not widely expected to follow a U . S . rate hike and the Canadian dollar would likely weaken on any Fed decision to raise U . S . rates . In other prices , the six - month when - issued T - bill softened to yield 3 . 45 percent from 3 . 41 percent . The one - year T - bill softened to yield 3 . 91 percent from 3 . 87 percent . The call loan rate traded at 3 . 0 percent , the center of the Bank of Canada ' s 2 . 75 - 3 . 25 percent target range . ( ( Jeffrey Hodgson ( 416 ) 941 - 8105 , e - mail :

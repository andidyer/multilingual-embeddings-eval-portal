Indonesian rupiah easier on ample liquidity . Indonesia ' s rupiah was easier against the dollar in thin early trading on Thursday on the back of ample rupiah liquidity and local dollar buying interest , dealers said .

Another dealer said the ample market liquidity was reflected in the fall of the overnight call money .

One - month swap was at 16 . 00 / 16 . 50 , two at 31 . 00 / 32 . 00 , three at 44 . 75 / 45 . 25 . Six - months swap was last at 88 . 25 / 88 . 75 points .

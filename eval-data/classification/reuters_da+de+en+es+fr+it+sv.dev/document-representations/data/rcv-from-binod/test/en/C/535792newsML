Iowa House approves 3 - year ban on new gaming . The Iowa House has approved a three - year moratorium on new gaming licenses in the state , but also granted exceptions for two communities that have been actively pursuing floating casinos . The House on Tuesday approved the moratorium 94 - 2 . The bill was sent to the Senate for technical amendment and it is expected to be returned to the House Thursday , a legislative aide said . Both Osceola and Keokuk have been excluded from the moratorium to allow them one more shot at receiving approval for casinos from the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission . Gov . Terry Branstad supports a five - year moratorium on new gaming , but would support a shorter period , Branstad spokesman Eric Woolson said earlier this month . Branstad will have three days to act on it once he receives the bill . The bill also bans the use of credit cards at automated teller machines at Iowa casinos and racetracks , but still permits the use of debit cards . When the moratorium ends , the legislation restricts new casinos to the Missouri and Mississippi rivers , where they are currently located . The state gaming commission in early April rejected an Argosy Gaming Co . application to operate a floating casino on West Lake near Osceola . A casino application for a Keokuk site is under consideration by the commission as well . ( ( - - David Bailey , 312 - 408 - 8647 ) )

Israeli bonds end little changed in dull trade . Israeli bonds closed little changed on Wednesday in what traders described as a dull session affected by a telecommunications workers strike . Indices : * Government bonds general : - 0 . 01 pct to 110 . 14 * CPI - linked government bonds : + 0 . 03 pct to 110 . 19 * Unlinked government bonds : - 0 . 01 pct to 109 . 93 * Dollar - linked government bonds : - 0 . 29 pct to 110 . 24 * Bank of Israel short - term Makam bills : + 0 . 02 pct to 108 . 02Volume including Makams was a low 120 million shekels . " Trading was quiet today . Early in the morning some of the telephones were still down because of the strike , so traders hesitated to make orders . I assume trading tomorrow will reflect the real situation in the market , " said Tiki Haddad of IBI Investment House . A strike at Israel ' s main telecommunications carrier , Bezeq Israel Telecom , left thousands of homes and businesses without full telephone services and forced the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to halt trading on Tuesday . The disruptions continued on Wednesday , although the exchange reopened for business . " CPI - linked long and medium bonds traded on very low volume . There was some downward pressure on unlinked bonds . The central bank issued 150 million shekels worth of unlinked bonds today that closed at 0 . 2 percent below market price , " Haddad said . " Tomorrow the market will react to the news of the budget cut and traders will return to CPI - long bonds because there is no fear that interest rates will rise , " she said . " The cut in the budget also means that the government will be raising less debt , further lowering yields . " The Israeli cabinet approved an 800 million shekel cut in the 1997 budget after a meeting that stretched into the early hours of Wednesday . The cuts were the third round of budget slashing since the draft 1997 budget was presented last autumn . The government had earlier approved some seven billion shekels in cuts and revenue - raising measures . Haddad said the rise of the shekel against the dollar recently had allayed fears of a very high July consumer price index . " People will return to unlinked bonds , " she said . The rise of the dollar against the shekel in June , which helped June ' s CPI to rise a steep 1 . 1 percent , had triggered fears of a series of high indices . The shekel has recovered some of its losses against the dollar in the past two weeks . The shekel rose sharply against the dollar on Wednesday . The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3 . 5140 shekels compared with 3 . 5300 on Tuesday . " The market has readjusted after June ' s high CPI and has now stabilised , " said a trader . The trader added that the central bank was now not expected to lower interest rates on July 28 . The Bank of Israel slashed its base lending rate in mid - June by 1 . 2 percentage points to an annualised 12 . 7 percent . The central bank will announce its monthly monetary programme for August on July 28 . Note : Makams are zero - coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year . The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity . ( $ 1 = 3 . 51 shekels ) - Shoshanna Solomon , Tel Aviv newsroom , 972 - 3 - 537 - 2211 x233 SAS DER

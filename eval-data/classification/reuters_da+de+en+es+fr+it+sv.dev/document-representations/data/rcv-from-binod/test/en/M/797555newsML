Italian shares end lower after Wall Street slip . Italian shares slipped back and ended lower on Wednesday after a short - lived rally on the back of better than expected U . S . economic data faltered and Wall Street started on a lower note this afternoon , dealers said . The market had pared back losses on the U . S . figures but concern over a warning from the Bundesbank over inflation and the lower Dow Jones finally outweighed the encouraging data . Trading volume was fairly thin with options expiry on Thursday and Italy markets closed Friday for Assumption holiday . All - share Mibtel index ended down 1 . 38 percent at 14 , 398 and the blue chip Mib30 index off 1 . 45 percent at 21 , 746 . The data showed U . S . July retail sales up 0 . 6 percent compared with a forecast 0 . 7 percent rise , while July producer prices marked the seventh successive monthly decline to show a fall of 0 . 1 percent with a consensus forecast of up 0 . 1 percent . Markets took the data positively , especially the further fall in PPI , but then slipped back awaiting further evidence of benign inflation from U . S . CPI July data on Thursday . The Bundesbank had earlier warned that it was scrutinising a recent upturn in inflation and would not hesitate to tighten its monetaty policy if warranted . Most blue chip stocks ended lower with energy giant ENI off 2 . 04 percent at 10 , 220 lire , Fiat down 2 . 09 percent at 5 , 723 and Pirelli down 0 . 95 percent at 4 , 781 lire , but Olivetti ended up 2 . 09 percent at 658 . 5 lire .

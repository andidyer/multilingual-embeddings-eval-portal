The Australian share market rebounded in afternoon trade led by a charge from market heavyweights BHP and CRA to close higher on Thursday after a midday dip and a fall on Wall Street on Wednesday . At 4 . 30 p . m . ( 0630 GMT ) , the All Ordinaries index ended 12 points up at 2247 . 1 . The September share price index also finished with a 12 point gain to 2246 but remained at a slight discount to the underlying index . Brokers said investors thought BHP and CRA had been sold down long enough and now represented good value , which attracted buyers and turned around market sentiment in the afternoon . " The market was looking fairly ordinary earlier on , but BHP and CRA started to come back a bit in the afternoon after people thought they had been sold down too far , " said Matthew Bloom , a broker at James Capel . Bloom said steady gains in bond prices helped lift bank stocks and other yield stocks . He said News Corp ' s annoucement that a budgeted strong profit rise in 1996 / 97 was attainable , was also a plus for a market which had lacked good news lately . He said the focus of the market on Friday would be BHP ' s first quarter result . " The market has got such a range on BHP that it ' s difficult to know which way it ' s going to go . " In other market news , the Australian dollar was trapped in a 30 point range despite an afternoon burst of samurai - related buying . At 5 . 15 p . m . ( 0715 GMT ) , the dollar was quoted at US $ 0 . 7892 / 97 . Australian bonds ended with modest gains after a lighter trading session with the short end supported by the possibility of a further domestic rate cut before the year end .

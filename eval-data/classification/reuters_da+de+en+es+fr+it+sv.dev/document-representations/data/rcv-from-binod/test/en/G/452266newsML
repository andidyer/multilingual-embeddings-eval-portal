SOCCER - PSG FACE TEST OF NERVE IN ATHENS . Holders Paris St Germain will have to shake off the dismal form that has characterised much of their season when they face a confident AEK Athens in the Cup Winners ' Cup on Thursday . The Greeks , looking for a place in a European semifinal for the first time in 20 years , managed an impressive 0 - 0 draw in the first leg of the quarter - final in Paris two weeks ago and have few worries ahead of the return tie . " We have a big chance to make Europe talk about us , " coach Petros Ravousis said . " The climate in the team is very good and we have no injuries . PSG remains a big club but we proved in France that we can advance . " AEK will play with three strikers in a bid to score an early goal . Demis Nikolaidis , who tops the Greek first division scorers ' table with 18 goals will team up with Christos Costis , who has scored 14 goals this season , and Daniel Batista from the Ivory Coast . " We want an early goal but we must watch PSG ' s counter - attacks , " an AEK official said . The Athens club are also expected to field Georgian midfielder Timour Ketspagia , who may play in England next season , and Yugoslav playmaker Toni Savevski . PSG , beaten 1 - 0 by Le Havre in a French league match last Friday , held one of their most intense training sessions of the season on Tuesday , concentrating on set pieces . " AEK pack the centre of their defence . We must take advantage of the spaces to counter - attack and develop our moves along the flanks , " PSG ' s Brazilian captain Rai said . Central defender Bruno N ' Gotty was nursing a slight thigh strain but looks fit to play . PSG ' s Brazilian manager Ricardo has decided against starting with either of his second strikers Julio Cesar , Dely Valdes and Cyrille Pouget , preferring to field fellow Brazilian Leonardo up front as a left wing with Patrice Loko leading the attack . Injured defenders Didier Domi and Alain Roche were not in the 18 - man squad but French international midfielder Vincent Guerin is back in favour after having been dropped for the last two matches . " If we lose this match we may have developments ( in PSG ) . If we win we will just think of the semifinal , " said Ricardo . He did not elaborate . Teams ( probable ) : AEK - Ilias Atmatsidis , Stephanos Borbokis , Michalis Kasapis , Stelios Manolas , Michalis Vlachos , Triantafilos Maheridis , Timour Ketspagia , Toni Savevski , Daniel Batista , Christos Costis , Demis NikolaidisPSG - Bernard Lama , Laurent Fournier , Bruno N ' Gotty , Paul le Guen , Daniel Kenedy , Leroy Jerome , Vincent Guerin , Rai , Benoit Cauet , Patrice Loko , Leonardo

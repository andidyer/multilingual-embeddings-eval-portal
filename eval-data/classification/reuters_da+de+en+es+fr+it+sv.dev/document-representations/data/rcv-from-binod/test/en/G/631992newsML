The EU withdrew its ambassadors from Tehran in April following the finding of a German court that Iran had been involved in the nmurder of Kurdish Iranian opposition leaders in Berlin . At the same time the EU suspended its so - called critical dialogue with Iran under which it was attempting to bring Iran closer to the West through talks . A move later by the EU to send its ambassadors back to Tehran was suspended when Tehran refused to accept the German envoy .

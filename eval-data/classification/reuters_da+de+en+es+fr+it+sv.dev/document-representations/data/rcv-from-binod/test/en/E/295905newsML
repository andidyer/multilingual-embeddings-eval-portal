Argentina says Brazil subsidies row drags on . Negotiations with Brazil over industrial subsidies are progressing " much more slowly than we expected , " Argentine Industry Secretary Alieto Guadagni said Thursday . Guadagni said he had cancelled a trip to Brazil planned for January 15 because of the delay in the talks , in which Argentina is demanding compensation for the neighboring country ' s investment policy . " It wasn ' t worth going because we are still in the preliminary stage of coming to an understanding , " Guadagni said at a news conference . He refused to specify what type of compensation Argentina wants . Brazil , Argentina ' s main trade partner , recently introduced a regime of tax incentives and subsidies to boost investments in poor areas in the north . The plan chiefly favors the automobile industry , reducing levies for imports of car parts and granting tax exemptions for purchases of machinery and other materials until 1999 , when Argentina and Brazil will launch a joint regime . The subsidies were rejected by car manufacturers in Argentina , who are demanding that imports of vehicles made in those Brazilian factories be taxed . Argentina and Brazil are the main partners in the customs union Mercosur , which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay . ( ( - - Patrick Adam , Redaccion Buenos Aires 541 318 - 0654 ) )

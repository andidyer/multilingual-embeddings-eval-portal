Chernomyrdin to present new Russian security chief . New security chief Ivan Rybkin , who wants an end to the public rowing which marred his precedessor ' s term in office , will meet members of the Russian Security Council on Monday . The government press service said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , would introduce Rybkin to his new colleagues . Chernomyrdin has taken over some responsibilities from President Boris Yeltsin while the president prepares for open heart surgery . Yeltsin named Rybkin as Security Council secretary on Saturday . He replaced disgraced general Alexander Lebed , sacked by Yeltsin last week and accused of blatant presidential ambitions and of failing to show team spirit . Rybkin , a loyal moderate , is also Yeltsin ' s new envoy to breakaway Chechnya . Yeltsin , 65 , is due to meet the communist speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow later on Monday . Yeltsin is chairman of the Security Council , which groups top defence , security and state officials . Rybkin , a former parliamentary speaker who turned 50 on Sunday , spent his first full day at work trying to undo some of the damage done during his tempestuous predecessor ' s term . He called for a stop to the kind of public rows between Kremlin officials which became the norm during Lebed ' s explosive four months in office . " Policies should be open and transparent for all to see , " he told Ekho Moskvy radio on Sunday . " But it is impermissible that there should be public fights between leading officials - - they should deal with their problems by the book , " he added . Rybkin suggested the work of the three " power ministries " should be much more closely coordinated . He said the interior , defence and security ministers should only report to Yeltsin when a coordinator was present and that a new body should be set up to control all weapons and equipment used by the three ministries ' forces . " It ' s difficult . I understand the full weight of the problem on my shoulders . . . I am sure we ' ll find a close partnership for the good of Russia , " he told Russian television . But it seemed highly unlikely that the three ministries , who jealously guard the right to operate their own armed forces , would agree to give up control of their weapons . The idea could annoy Lebed , who described Rybkin as a failed bureaucrat who had no idea as to how Russia ' s security could be guaranteed . But Rybkin declined to exchange taunts and was at pains to praise Lebed for the peace deal which ended the 21 - month Chechen war on August 31 . " The days have gone when we used to tease each other because someone ' s nose was too big or their ears were the wrong shape . We understood this was wrong when still at school - - it ' s totally useless , " Rybkin said . He won cautious approval from the Chechen separatists , who had previously seen Lebed as the only hope for a permanent end to the bitter war in which tens of thousands have died . " I want to assure ( the Chechen leadership ) that the talks will continue . We have no intention of stepping back from agreements which have already been signed . We want peaceful solutions to all aspects of this problem , " Rybkin said .

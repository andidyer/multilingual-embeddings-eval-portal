IPE natural gas futures slide , trade busted in January . IPE natural gas futures lost ground across the board in active trade on Wednesday , with traders taking advantage of falls to lock in prices for next winter , brokers said . A trade for January next year was busted by the Exchange , after a broker entered a bid of 16 pence a therm ( p / th ) as an offer in error , leading its client to pick up its own offer . " Obviously both parties agreed to bust the trade , " said a spokeswoman for the IPE . A total volume of 305 lots was traded , making for a comparatively busy morning session which generally sees volumes of less than 100 lots . Nearly half of the trade was concentrated in January and February . January shed 0 . 230 p / th to end the morning at 16 . 20 p / th , while February fell 0 . 210 p / th to 16 . 30 p / th . " It was certainly very active in Jan and Feb , " said one broker . " I guess at those levels it looks like a reasonable lock - in in the short term . " Selling of the well - supplied summer months continued , while May also shed 0 . 145 p / th to 10 . 005 as warm temperatures in Britain pressured the front end of the market . Independent forecaster Weather Services Crop said on Wednesday that temperatures in Northwest Europe will trend lower in coming days , reaching normal or below normal levels by late in the week . - - Rosalind Russell , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 5387

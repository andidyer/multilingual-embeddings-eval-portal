Dlr seen easy vs yen , mark in Tokyo , eyes on stocks . The dollar is expected to remain easy against the yen and the mark during Asian trading time on Wednesday , with the market looking towards the Tokyo stock and bond markets for its near - term direction . But importers and Japanese investors are likely to pick up dollars near and below 125 yen , keeping the dollar ' s downside solid around that level , dealers said . " We will watch closely moves in Japanese stocks to see if ( yesterday ' s ) strength in the Tokyo stock market was for real , " a city bank dealer said . A trust bank dealer said if Tokyo stocks continue to strengthen , this will keep the yen well - bid . " Overseas traders are still willing to sell dollars for yen , " he said . He added that if the greenback clearly breaks through psychological support of 125 yen , stop - loss sales may emerge to take it down even further . But the city bank dealer said Japanese importers and investors will be keen to buy dollars near 125 yen , providing support for the dollar . " Basically , fundamental factors in the market have not changed yet , so I think it is still in a downward correction period , " he added . In New York , the dollar was dragged down by comments from Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke that he does not welcome a further rise in the dollar . Against the yen , the greenback remained weak after Tuesday ' s strong rally in Tokyo stocks and a climb in Japanese market interest rates . Dealers said the dollar ' s topside remains heavy against the mark in Asia . The pound gained strength overnight after Britain ' s newly formed Labour government ordered an increase in interest rates to 6 . 25 percent from 6 . 0 percent . But the impact on currency markets may be limited in Asia , the trust bank dealer said . After a monetary meeting with Bank of England Governor Eddie George , Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday also announced that he was giving the central bank operational independence to set interest rates .

Church says 45 dead over land this year in Brazil . More Brazilians have died in disputes over land so far this year compared with the total number for 1995 , a Catholic church group said on Wednesday . Forty - five landless workers and union activists linked with their cause were killed between January and August this year , up from 41 in 1995 , said Irio Luiz Conti , executive secretary of the church ' s Pastoral Land Commission ( CPT ) . This year ' s rise was mostly due to a clash in April when police killed 19 peasants demanding land in Para state in Brazil ' s Amazon region , he said . The commission was also concerned about an expected surge in the number of forced evictions of squatter farmers after upcoming municipal elections , Conti added . " Our biggest worry is that several state governments have won a large number of eviction orders that will probably be implemented after the elections , " he said . Brazilians vote on Thursday in a first round of municipal elections with a second round due on November 15 in big cities . The CPT and the Landless Movement , which claims to represent more than four million of Brazil ' s landless families , have repeatedly accused the government of neglecting its programme to distribute large , unused farms to the landless . The United Nation ' s Food and Agriculture Organisation said in August that Brazil faced " a crucial challenge " to redress the imbalance of land ownership under which about 80 percent of arable land belongs to 10 percent of landowners . President Fernando Henrique Cardoso , responding to such criticism in a weekly radio address broadcast on Tuesday , said 35 , 000 families have been given land so far this year and the target of 60 , 000 settled families in 1996 would be met .

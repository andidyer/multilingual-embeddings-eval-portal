New immigration law won ' t hurt French ties - Charette . Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said on Monday he did not believe increasingly tough rules set for nationals of ex - French African colonies seeking entrance to France would harm ties with those states . " No , I don ' t think France ' s image will be affected in those countries , " de Charette told Radio Monte Carlo , which asked him about the negative effects of stiffer demands on North African Arabs or black Africans seeking tourist visas to France . " Those rules are indispensable in curbing illegal immigration . " It is also in the interests of those countries that we be able to fight efficiently against illegal immigration which is a tragedy for us , a tragedy for them and especially , a tragedy for those foreigners who enter France legally , " de Charette said . He was answering questions after thousands of demonstrators marched through Paris on Sunday demanding the withdrawal of the latest controversial immigration bill intended to shut loopholes in already tough existing laws . Government spokesmen say the proposed new rules will affect only about 150 , 000 people among 80 million annual visitors to France . Under the rules , people without sufficient means of support and hailing from those countries which provide the brunt of illegal immigrants to France will have to provide even more proof that they intend to leave when their visas expire . Critics say the rules are undemocratic and racist . De Charette said even tougher rules existed for tourist visas to the United States . Asked to comment about protests in West or Central Africa against the new French rules , de Charette said : " That will not change our attitude . We have decided to end illegal immigration and we will maintain this type of visa regulations . "

Nintendo boss zaps Sony as videogame war hots up . Nintendo Co Ltd ' s outspoken president Hiroshi Yamauchi on Monday fired a salvo at rival Sony Corp , saying its challenge to Nintendo ' s videogame market share " amounts to nothing " . Yamauchi , struggling to hold Nintendo ' s ground in Japan ' s dog - eat - dog , one trillion yen ( $ 8 . 1 billion ) battleground for videogame users , also attacked Sony ' s aggressive software strategy for the 32 - bit PlayStation player . " Most of its software titles are silly and boring , " he told a news conference . " A flood of uninteresting and boring software will destroy Japan ' s videogame market , " Yamauchi warned , adding that there would be a turning point next year for 32 - bit game players due to their technical limitations . Nintendo last June introduced its cutting - edge 64 - bit game player , Nintendo64 , in Japan in a bid to recapture the top spot in the harshly competitive videogame market . But sales growth so far remains slower than expected because of the overwhelming strength of newcomer Sony ' s 32 - bit PlayStation . Domestic sales of Sony ' s PlayStation by the end of December were five million since its introduction in December 1994 , compared to 1 . 7 million for the Nintendo64 , which was introduced in June last year . Analysts say the most decisive factor is the number of game software titles . While only about 10 titles were available for the Nintendo64 by early January , Sony has amassed more than 600 titles for PlayStation . Sony has said it plans to further boost the software titles to 800 this year . Nintendo was also dealt a major blow by Sony last year when two software houses said they would produce the latest versions of their best - selling games " Dragon Quest " and " Final Fantasy " for Sony ' s PlayStation . The Dragon Quest series , which has in six titles , has sold 19 . 3 million games since it was introduced for Nintendo ' s 16 - bit Famicon machine in 1986 . Some analysts believe the shift will substantially hurt Nintendo , with Sony taking more than two million Dragon Quest followers from it . Asked if there had been any impact on its business from the shift by software makers , Yamauchi declared : " There is virtually no impact on Nintendo ' s business . " He said although the maker of Dragon Quest had said the new version of the game would start selling in spring 1999 , nobody knew for sure when it would actually be launched or whether the new version would prove to be more popular than existing ones . Despite relatively slow sales in Japan , Nintendo enjoys booming sales of Nintendo64 in the U . S . , Yamauchi said . He said actual sales of Nintendo64 in Japan amounted to 1 . 7 million units as of the end of the Christmas season since its June 1996 launch , excluding retailers ' stocks of an estimated 130 , 000 to 140 , 000 players . The 64 - bit Nintendo machine was sold out in the U . S . market , where the company had shipped 2 . 14 million units since its launch at the end of September . ( $ 1 = 122 yen )

US Midwest direct hogs seen steady - off $ 0 . 50 - trade . U . S . Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady to mostly $ 0 . 50 per cwt lower , pressured by extended losses in pork prices , according to livestock dealers . Top prices for hogs delivered to plants in Iowa / southern Minnesota could range from $ 52 . 50 to $ 53 . 00 . Some packer buyers said they already had adequate supplies for Tuesday . Northern Minnesota buying stations had a tough time buying hogs on Monday because of a weekend snow storm and brisk winds , which plugged country roads with drifts up to ten feet deep , sources in the area said . Illinois top prices at plants were seen ranging Tuesday from $ 51 . 00 to $ 51 . 50 and Indiana / Ohio hogs could trade from $ 51 . 50 to $ 52 . 00 , sources in those areas said . Weakening pork prices were tied to abundant hog supplies late last week coupled with sluggish retail demand . At midday , lower loin , butt , belly and trimmings prices offset light gains in skinned hams . There were 27 . 63 fabricated pork loads and 15 . 5 loads of pork trimmings reported sold , according to USDA . But hog price declines could be curbed by colder weather moving into the Corn Belt , which was seen restricting hog movement later this week . ( ( Chicago newsdesk 312 - 408 - 872 ) )

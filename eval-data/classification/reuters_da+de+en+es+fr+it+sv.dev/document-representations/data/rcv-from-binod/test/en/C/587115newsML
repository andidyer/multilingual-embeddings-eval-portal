Global Industrial revs may not be recouped . Global Industrial Technologies Inc said Thursday it is " unlikely " that lost revenue at its Ameri - Forge flange operation can be made up during the current fiscal year , but it expects to be at full capacity before year - end . J . L . Jackson , chairman and chief executive officer , said in a press release that demand for the company ' s products " remains high " despite the fact that production at Ameri - Forge was " adversely affected by downtime due to repair and replacement of forging machinery . " Jackson said new equipment is being installed , but the company does not foresee lost revenue being made up this year . The company also said earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter , reported today , reflect a $ 0 . 05 per share negative impact due to a 39 percent year - to - year increase in the company ' s tax rate . The company reported net income of $ 10 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 45 per share , for the second quarter , ended April 30 . The results were flat with those of a year earlier . The company added that margins were hurt by higher depreciation expense as a result of added capital investment at Ameri - Forge in the past year . Global Industrial said the previously mentioned adverse impact of the strong dollar on sales and of higher natural gas prices on manufacturing costs in the magnesite business within the minerals division continue to affect operations . Adding to this downward pressure on margins , the company said certain high - profit property sales that took place in fiscal 1996 have not been repeated so far this year . Jackson said that despite these " mostly short - term , negative pressures on operating performance , " many of the company ' s operating units have produced " outstanding results " this year . Jackson cited for example the industrial tool division ' s continuation of double - digit growth in revenues and operating profit . " In spite of these short - term difficulties , " Jackson said , " we continue to see outstanding opportunities for profitable growth , both domestically and internationally , in each of our operating companies .

Rabbi warns of rift between Israel , U . S . Jews . A leading U . S . rabbi warned on Sunday of a " huge rift " between Israel and American Jews if the Jewish state passed a law regulating conversions . The law has reignited the feud between strictly observant ultra - Orthodox Jews who control religious institutions in Israel and Reform Jews who are a majority in the American Jewish community . A delegation of Reform rabbis representing thousands of U . S . Jews was in Israel on Sunday to urge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scrap legislation put forward by members of his ultra - Orthodox coalition and due for a parliament vote this month . " We want Netanyahu to know that if this law passes it will . . . create a huge rift between Israel and diaspora Jews , especially in the United States , " said Rabbi Eric Yoffie , head of the Reform movement ' s Union of American Hebrew Congregations . The law would enshrine a longstanding ban on conversions done in Israel by non - Orthodox rabbis . Non - Orthodox conversions done abroad would still be recognised by the Jewish state . Ultra - Orthodox parties , key components in Netanyahu ' s coalition , say Reform conversions are not stringent enough . They also insist the legislation would not affect Jews outside Israel . They have made passage of the law a condition for their continuing support in Netanyahu ' s government . " Even when we ' re not directly affected , what we ' re hearing from American Jews is that they ' re no longer prepared to tolerate a situation where the government of Israel does not recognise the legitimacy of their religious institutions , " Yoffie told Reuters . He said Reform rabbis would meet Netanyahu on Sunday . Members of the Chief Rabbinate , part of the ultra - Orthodox establishment in Israel , rejected initiatives for a meeting .

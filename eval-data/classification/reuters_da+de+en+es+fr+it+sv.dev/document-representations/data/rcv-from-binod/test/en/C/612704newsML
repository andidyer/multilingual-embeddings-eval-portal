Randgold finalises West Rand mine merger . Randgold and Exploration Co Ltd announced on Monday that the merger of its three West Rand gold mines has been finalised and will involve a deal worth about 700 million rand . Durban Roodepoort Deep Ltd will be the vehicle for the merger and will swallow up Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Co Ltd and Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Ltd , creating a single mining company with a market capitalisation of around one billion rand . Randgold also announced that it had been agreed in principle that Durban Deep acquire the mineral rights of Southern Witwatersrand Exploration Co Ltd in a deal worth about 55 million rand to be settled by the issue of two million Durban Deep ordinary shares of 26 rand each . Randgold will also receive a five percent royalty on any future revenue generated by the exploitation of these rights . Shareholders in Buffels and Blyvoor are being offered 77 and 20 Durban Deep shares respectively for every 100 shares held . This will involve the issue of 20 . 4 million new Durban Deep shares , valued at 519 million rand at last Wednesday ' s closing price of 25 . 50 rand on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange . Blyvoor option holders are being offered 20 new Durban Deep options for every 100 options held , resulting in the issue of 1 . 3 million new Durban Deep options valued at 13 . 5 million rand . Existing Durban Deep options and " A " options will be converted into new options to rationalise the number of financial instruments in the company . Chairman of Randgold ' s mining division , Roger Kebble , said the merger will benefit all three companies by meshing their operational and financial circumstances to capitalise on strengths and minimise weaknesses . " Buffels has a small ore reserve and resource base , but strong cash flows . Blyvoor has adequate resources but will have to complete a substantial capex programme to access these . Durban Deep has a very large surface and underground resource base and a solid infrastructure , " Kebble said . " A key component of our strategy will be to drive down the cost curve , and the significant synergies inherent in the merger will reduce the pay limits , increasing ore reserves and improving the flexibility of the mines , " he added . The broader mining base would make the new company less vulnerable to financial downturns which sometimes result from operating risks like seismicity and gold price fluctuations , Kebble said . The bigger company would also justify the establishment of new centralised services and facilities , including an elution plant and a refinery , he said . The enlarged group will be able to fund longer - term capex programmes from short - term profitable mining operations and its higher market capitalisation would facilitate access to additional funding . The South Wits mineral rights represent at least 16 million ounces in situ which translates into about 10 million mineable ounces . The ore body is contiguous with Durban Deep ' s existing ore bodies and the company is well - placed to exploit the ore body when it becomes feasible , Randgold said .

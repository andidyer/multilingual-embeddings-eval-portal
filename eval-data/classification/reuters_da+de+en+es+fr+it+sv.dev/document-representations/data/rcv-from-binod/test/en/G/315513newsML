Britain ' s first war crimes trial collapses . Britain ' s first war crimes trial collapsed on Friday when a jury ruled that the defendant , a former commander of police in Belarus during the Nazi occupation , was not mentally fit to be tried . Doctors had told the court that Szymon Serafinowicz , who is 86 and had lived in Britain for half a century , was suffering from dementia , probably caused by Alzheimer ' s disease . " The result of this ( decision ) is that all proceedings in this case are stayed , " prosecuting lawyer Sir Derek Spencer said . A doctor called by the prosecution during the eight - day hearing , held in conditions of complete secrecy for legal reasons , said he believed Serafinowicz was faking the symptoms . The hearing had been called to decide whether Serafinowicz was fit enough to stand a full trial for war crimes , which had been expected to last about eight weeks . The case was to have been the first held under Britain ' s controversial War Crimes Act , passed in 1991 despite huge opposition in the House of Lords ( upper house ) . Serafinowicz emigrated to Britain after World War Two and lived in Banstead , south of London . He was charged with three specimen counts of murdering Jews in his homeland Belarus ( then known as Byelorussia ) during the winter of 1941 - 1942 . He has admitted he was a senior figure in the police force set up by the Germans after they invaded in 1941 and which helped the Nazis wipe out almost the entire Jewish population . He always denied the charges . The prosecution told how Serafinowicz was accused of being involved in the massacre of hundreds of Jews on November 9 , 1941 , in the town of Mir , where he was police commander . They said he had also led police in convoys of horse - driven sledges through deep snow to slaughter Jews in surrounding villages during January and February of 1942 . Witnesses said Serafinowicz had been eager to go to trial so that he could clear his name . His defence argued that the accusers were either mistaken or lying . Serafinowicz ' s son Kazimierz and his granddaughter Helen told the court his mental condition had deteriorated over the past three years . The former carpenter had been extremely self - reliant , cooking , shopping and cleaning for his sick wife , who died in October 1993 . In recent years he had stopped taking care of the house , no longer watched the television or read newspapers and would get lost trying to get to the post office he had used for over 20 years , Helen and Kazimierz said . A specialist in old age psychiatry called by the defence said the pattern was consistent with Alzheimer ' s disease and an independent psychiatrist appointed by the court agreed . But the prosecution ' s expert witness , forensic psychiatrist Dr Phillip Joseph , suggested it showed only that Serafinowicz had lost interest in life following the death of his Polish - born wife and under pressure from the impending trial . Serafinowicz was charged with war crimes in July 1995 . The prosecution said replies Serafinowicz gave to Joseph in a mental test - - that a giraffe has two legs and that the season was summer on a day when it was snowing - - indicated he was feigning his mental difficulties . The defence dismissed the suggestion . " Are you looking at the best actor this country has produced in recent times or are you looking at a sick old man , near the end of his life ? " defence lawyer William Clegg asked the jury . Serafinowicz , a tiny , frail - looking man with a full head of white hair , sat quietly throughout the hearing , occasionally seeming to fall asleep but at others times proving very alert . When the lawyers talked of his happier early life in Belarus his face lit up with broad toothless smiles . Jews had made up around half of the 6 , 000 population of Mir before the war . They were almost entirely wiped out by 1944 .

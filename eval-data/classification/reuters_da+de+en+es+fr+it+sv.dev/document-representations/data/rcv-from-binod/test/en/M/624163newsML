FOCUS - Dollar set to push higher , eyes on EMU . The clash between the German government and its central bank over its gold assets is unlikely to derail European Monetary Union but safe - haven currencies such as the dollar may be boosted on perceptions the euro will be soft from the start , analysts say . " People will be going back to what they are used to , which are currencies not involved in EMU - and that is set to continue , " said Francis Breedon , senior foreign exchange economist at Lehman Brothers . The dollar surged nearly two pfennigs to highs of 1 . 7067 marks on Thursday , boosted by its safe - haven status after Germany ' s central bank , the Bundesbank , renounced government plans to revalue its gold assets . At 1145 GMT dollar / mark was trading at 1 . 7027 against 1 . 6904 in late Europe on Wednesday . Buba chief economist Otmar Issing condemned Bonn ' s plan to drum up extra profit by revaluing Bundesbank reserves as " even more creative " than steps taken in other countries . The Bundesbank ' s harsh attack on the government , which aimed to revalue the Buba ' s reserves to give a much needed injection to Bonn ' s public finances , sent jitters through the market in the run - up to EMU . And the brawl has added spice to EMU uncertainty in Europe , coming in the wake of an unexpectedly strong showing for the French left - wing Socialists party in weekend elections . " It is getting to the stage were you can ' t even make an educated guess about what the next stage is , " said Lehman ' s Breedon . Market expectations are that if the Socialists are elected during the final run - off this weekend , they will push for Italy and Spain to be included among EMU ' s founding members - in a move seen to be watering down the euro from the start . " The dollar should be favoured against the deutschmark because of the French elections and because the gold - revaluation rift has given a blow to Germany ' s reputation , " said Claudio Demolli , foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch . The gold plan , which would help Germany reduce its deficits to make the grade for EMU , will make it more difficult for Germany to reject countries such as Spain and Italy in the first round , said analysts . " Last night ' s developments ( Buba / Bonn clash ) reinforced that . If EMU goes ahead on time and Germany uses one - off measures to reduce the budget deficit , then it is going to be difficult to exclude other countries - particularly Italy from joining , " said Nick Stamenkovic , economist at DKB international . " Consequently , the euro will be significantly softer - this will be bad news for the deutschmark , " said Stamenkovic . And aside from getting a leg - up from EMU uncertainty , analysts said the dollar will also benefit from its own domestic influences . " Fundamentals are still dollar supportive , the U . S . economy is still growing at a healthy pace and there are still prospects of further rate hikes in the future , " said Stamenkovic .

Montenegro reformer deals major rebuff to Milosevic . [ CORRECTED 15 : 20 GMT ] President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia appears to have suffered a setback in his bid for uncontested power across federal Yugoslavia after his reformist rival in Montenegro prevailed over hardliners , analysts said on Tuesday . The Main Board of Montenegro ' s ruling Socialists ( DPS ) unanimously voted Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic back as party vice - president on Monday . Under pressure from Serbia in March , the same board had ousted the charismatic 35 - year - old Djukanovic as DPS party vice - president as a prelude to stripping him of the premiership . But the ploy failed as the tiny Yugoslav republic rallied behind the pro - Western politician who had roused Milosevic ' s ire by demanding his withdrawal from any role in troubled Yugoslavia ' s future and by courting support abroad . Milosevic ' s second term as Serbian president will expire this year and according to the constitution he cannot be elected as republican leader for the third time . Informed sources say the Serbian political strongman has set his sights on the federal presidency . But that post is now largely ceremonial , so Milosevic would need to change the constitution to give himself broad executive powers as Yugoslav head of state . If he won the federal presidency , Milosevic would also try to reduce the authority of republican authorities and the potential obstacle to this is Djukanovic ' s Montenegro , diplomats said . " That was the true reason why Milosevic ventured into a fierce settling of accounts with Djukanovic , " one said . " With Monday ' s outcome of the political conflict in Montenegro , Milosevic appears more and more at a loss to fully control all developments in the country . " The Djukanovic affair pitted pragmatists anxious to end Yugoslavia ' s international isolation , caused by Serbia ' s central role in Bosnia ' s war , against a Socialist old guard grouped round Milosevic that is resisting Western pressure for political reform . The attack on Djukanovic was spearheaded by Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic who wound up losing support within the Main Board and was finally forced to invite Djukanovic to return to the party post under pressure from his former patrons in Belgrade . " Apparently Bulatovic was told to back off , that he made a mess of things and that the entire manoeuvre to oust to Djukanovic had dismally backfired , " a senior political source in Belgrade told Reuters on Tuesday . " The political fallout of the messy would - be ouster and the outcome is certainly not good in an election year , " said a Western diplomat , referring to Serbian presidential and parliamentary elections that must be held by 1998 . Djukanovic said in an interview early this year that Yugoslavia had no future with a man like Milosevic at its helm , prompting Belgrade to accuse him of seeking Montenegro ' s secession from what remains of Yugoslavia . Montenegro , Serbia ' s only partner in the federation and its only access to the sea , has been frustrated by the slow pace of reforms and traditional leftist policies of its bigger ally . Djukanovic has pursued an open door policy towards the West in contrast to Belgrade , which is isolated by lingering international sanctions and faces Western pressure to improve human rights . Djukanovic enjoys widespread support including the liberal and popular speaker of the Montenegrin parliament , Svetozar Marovic , and most opposition parties . He is applauded for his success in launching a privatisation process involving up to 95 percent of Montenegro ' s economy . ( Corrects to show that not entire 95 percent of economy has already changed ownership . ) " Milosevic made a serious mistake by underestimating Djukanovic ' s popularity , " the source said . Since the start of the political showdown , Djukanovic has toured several countries securing tens of millions of dollars in loans and investment deals from Slovakia , Greece and Britain . Djukanovic secured $ 90 million in loans from Greece last month to boost his tourist industry . His success sent Milosevic scampering on an abortive mission to the Greek capital to personally scuttle the U . S . - approved deal , Belgrade independent media had reported . But in a bitter blow , Milosevic was rebuffed by his usually staunch Greek allies who in turn voiced concern over the lack of democratisation and privatisation in Serbia .

Kuwait official says Iraq must honor zones . A Kuwaiti official on Friday dismissed Iraq ' s decision to halt attacks against U . S . and allied warplanes flying over its north and south and said Baghdad had to recognise the no - fly zones . The senior official said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must recognise the Western air - patrolled zones that ban Iraqi aircraft flights , including an expanded one in the south up to the 33rd parallel on the outskirts of Baghdad . He was speaking after the Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) quoted an official spokesman for the ruling Revolutionary Command Council as saying Iraq " decided today to suspend our military reaction ( until further notice ) to the parallel lines " as of 2000 GMT . But the Iraqi agency said Baghdad still considered the five - year - old no - fly zones to be illegitimate according to international law and U . N . Security Council resolutions . The Iraqi announcement was greeted cautiously by Washington , which had assembled an array of warships and planes in the region for an expected attack on Iraq after Baghdad said it fired anti - aircraft missiles this week at western planes policing the no - fly zones . The U . S . Defense Department described as " encouraging " the statement but said the United States would watch the situation carefully . France also cautiously welcomed the announcement , saying such a decision would help defuse tensions in the Gulf region . The Kuwaiti official said that some of the 1991 Gulf War allies also demanded Iraq ' s " removal of air defences from the new section " between the 32nd and 33rd parallels in addition to its recognition of the zones . The expanded southern zone was announced last week following U . S . cruise missiles attacks against Iraqi defences in the area in retaliation for Baghdad ' s military role in factional Kurdish fighting in the north of the country . Like Washington the Kuwaiti official said his small Gulf Arab state would judge Iraq by its actions and not words , stressing that Saddam " cannot be trusted " .

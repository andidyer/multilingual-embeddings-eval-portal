Singapore launches new index for regional firms . Singapore launched a new regional share index on Tuesday in an effort to boost its position as one of Asia ' s top equity trading centres . Announcing the new index , Finance Minister Richard Hu said the Stock Exchange of Singapore ( SES ) had recently attracted a large number of foreign companies , which now represented about 25 percent of the market ' s total capitalisation . He said the Business Times Singapore Regional Index ( SRI ) , which has 38 component stocks ranging from shipyards and electronics firms to finance and telecommunications companies , would be a clear benchmark to measure the performance of Asian regional investment portfolios . " This reflects the increasing international dimension of the Singapore stock market , " Hu told a ceremony to launch the index . Hu said the Singapore government would also introduce a range of other measures to help promote Singapore as a centre for international securities trading and investment management . With immediate effect , foreign companies meeting certain criteria could apply to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to convert or list their shares in Singapore dollars , he said . The criteria included having more than 35 percent of revenue , profits or expenses attributable to Singapore operations , and having senior managers responsible for the business located in Singapore . Hu also said the SES was reviewing the structure of the local stock options market to open participation in it to firms that were not members of the SES , and was working with banks to allow quotation of unit trusts . The SES said in a statement the new regional share index would be weighted by market capitalisation and would only include large firms with a high exposure to regional markets . Of the 38 SRI stocks , 24 are quoted in Singapore dollars and 14 in U . S . dollars . Seven of the components are the foreign tranches of Singapore companies which have both local and foreign tranche listings . Hu said the Singapore International Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) would study the index ' s performance to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a futures contract based on it . He said six Singapore banks would jointly sponsor a unit trust to invest exclusively in the SRI component stocks . Analysts said the package of measures should help boost trading in the shares of foreign firms listed in Singapore . They said the new index should help companies such as Hong Kong - based conglomerate Jardine Matheson , which had not been included in a major stock index since it switched its primary listing to Singapore from Hong Kong two years ago . " It offers companies which are currently not on any index an exposure . That ' s important , " said Michael Tan , research manager at local brokerage Lee & Co . Inder Bethal Singh Thakral , managing director of electronic goods distributor Thakral Corp Ltd , one of the new SRI components , said he thought his company would benefit from being included in the new index . " The investor public will get more chance to look at it now and look at it more from a regional perspective , " he said . - - Singapore newsroom 65 - 8703080

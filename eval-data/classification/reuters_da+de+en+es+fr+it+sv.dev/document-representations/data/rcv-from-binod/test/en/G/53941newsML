" PADANIA " SOCCER FANS THREATEN ITALIAN SUPPORTERS . Supporters of northern soccer club Atalanta , declaring themselves citizens of Umberto Bossi ' s would - be state " Padania " , have threatened violence against fans from Italian club Fiorentina at a game on Sunday . Florence vice police chief Sergio Traviani said an anonymous letter postmarked " Bergamo , Padania " had been sent last month to his office and to Fiorentina , whose fans clashed with supporters from Atalanta during the Italian Cup final last May . Some 70 fans were injured at the match , won by Fiorentina . " Do not return to Bergamo , lest it become your grave , " the type - written letter read , according to Italian news agencies . " Here , among the brothers of the free land , you will pay for everything and pay a high price , " it added . Bossi intends to declare " independence " for " Padania " on Sunday evening in Venice at the end of a symbol - laden " March to the Sea " along the River Po , Italy ' s longest river . " The 15th of September will go down in history as a day of mourning for Florence and her sons , " the letter concluded . Traviani said Florence police would escort some 10 buses of Fiorentina supporters to Sunday ' s match in Bergamo . " We ' ve received similar threats for other games , " Traviani told reporters . " But we ' re taking this seriously because we know there ' s no love lost between these groups of fans . "

Tuapse oil pipeline repairs nearly complete - Tass . Repairs to an oil pipeline feeding the Black Sea export terminal of Tuapse were nearly completed , the Emergency Situations Ministry said on Thursday . A section of the line running from Tikhoretsk to Tuapse was closed due to a small hole in the link . The ministry , quoted by Prime - Tass news agency , said that an accident caused the hole to appear at 08 . 25 Moscow time ( 0525 GMT ) and that corrosion was probably to blame . Only a tiny amount of oil spilled , and the ministry said the leaked crude covered 104 square metres . The hole was in a section of pipeline near the town of Ust - Labinsk , west of Krasnodar . The ministry did not quantify the impact on total oil exports from Tuapse . Fuel oil , gas oil and crude are lifted from the port . - - Moscow Newsroom , + 7095 941 8520

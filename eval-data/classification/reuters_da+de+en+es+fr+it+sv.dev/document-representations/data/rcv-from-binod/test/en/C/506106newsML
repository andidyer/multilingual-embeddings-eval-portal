Banco do Brasil aims to expand in Sao Paulo state . Brazilian government bank Banco do Brasil aims to expand its activities in Sao Paulo state in a move to increase the participation of the state in the bank ' s total revenues , said a bank official . Currently , operations in the state of Sao Paulo account for 20 percent of the bank ' s revenues , said Roberto Barroso , executive superintendent at Banco do Brasil in Sao Paulo . But Barroso sees potential for growth . " We believe that Sao Paulo may contribute more to the bank ' s global revenues , " he told reporters , noting that Sao Paulo ' s economy represents about 40 percent of Brazil ' s gross domestic product ( GDP ) . Sao Paulo along with Rio de Janeiro , Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul states are considered the most important areas for Banco do Brasil , he said . Barroso said Banco do Brasil aims to increase the number of its Sao Paulo clients by 20 percent by the end of 1997 . To attract more clients , the bank plans to continue investing sharply in technology to offer global banking services , including credit , home banking and insurance products , he added . Banco do Brasil ' s strategy may also include the opening of new branches in the state , Barroso said . The bank now has 463 branches , of which 100 in the city of Sao Paulo . Barroso said the expansion of the branch network would not mean that new staff will be hired . He said the bank has been reducing personnel under its plan to cut costs , but he noted that he sees no reason for dismissals in the state ' s branches . The bank has around 15 , 000 employees in Sao Paulo . ( ( - - Fatima Cristina , Sao Paulo Newsroom 5511 2485412 ) )

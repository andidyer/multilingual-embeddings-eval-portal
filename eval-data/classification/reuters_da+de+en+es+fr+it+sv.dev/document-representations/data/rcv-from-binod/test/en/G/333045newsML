Japan apologises for spokesman ' s sex slave remark . Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto apologised to visiting South Korean President Kim Young - sam on Saturday for remarks by his spokesman that there was a " social background " to Tokyo ' s use of sex slaves during World War Two . " On the issue of comfort women , I am worried about the impact of reported remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary ( Seiroku ) Kajiyama , " Hashimoto told Kim during a lunch meeting at the start of their one - day summit . " I am sorry . That ( view ) is not our real intention , " he said . Remarks by Hashimoto and Kim were released to reporters by Japanese officials . The issue of the so - called " comfort women " , which historians say involved hundreds of thousands of Filipino , Korean , Chinese and Indonesian women , is one of the key topics on the summit agenda . In remarks reported by Japanese media on Friday , Kajiyama indirectly defended the Japanese military ' s use of the " comfort women " in front - line brothels during World War Two . " It is odd teaching them ( Japanese children ) of the comfort women issue , without teaching the social background of an authorised prostitution system at that time , " Kajayma said . " When they ( comfort women ) went to the fronts , they got money . Among them , there were some who were drafted , " he was quoted as saying . During the lunch , Kim told Hashimoto a clear explanation was needed on why Kajiyama made the remarks in order to satisfy outraged South Korean public opinion . " The timing of the reported remarks is unfortunate . Explanations must be given to satisfy the Korean people who were shocked by the remarks , " Kim told Hashimoto . " This issue is very sensitive on the part of the Korean people . " Hashimoto assured Kim that Kajiyama was not expressing neither his , nor the Japanese government ' s views on the comfort women issue . Repeating comments he made to Kim during a summit meeting between them last June in the South Korean resort of Cheju , Hashimoto said Japan had accepted that use of the comfort women was wrong and indefensible . " There is absolutely no difference between myself and the government on this issue , " Hashimoto told Kim during the lunch . " From the bottom of my heart , I apologise and I am regretful . At no other time has women ' s honour and dignity been hurt more than in this case , " Hashimoto said .

New minister vows health drive in Romania . Seven years of rule by ex - Communists have left Romania ' s health care system penniless and unable to cope with epidemics and malnutrition mainly hitting children , the new health minister said on Tuesday . " Up to 70 percent of the population live beneath the poverty line , while another five percent have so much money that they don ' t know what to do with it , " Stefan Iosif Dragulescu told his first news conference . " An irrational policy - - not oriented towards real democracy and a market economy but for the benefit of a handful of people - - destroyed the economy and the health of the people . " Dragulescu , a cardiologist , said he would seek an increase to four percent of state spending on health from 2 . 7 percent set by the leftist government ousted in last month ' s elections . Improving ante - natal and post - natal care was his priority along with a battle to reduce the country ' s six million smokers - - in a population of 23 million - - and ban smoking in public places . Romania ' s health care system , already crumbling under the Communists , has been thrown into total disarray since the 1989 execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu . Lack of equipment and medicines , bad water and food supplies and poor hygiene standards have contributed to outbreaks of typhoid , meningitis and hundreds of cases of diarrhoea and related illnesses . The birth rate is negative and falling . Romania accounts for half of Europe ' s child AIDS cases , a legacy of Ceausescu ' s refusal to admit that hundreds of cases of the disease were caused by transfusions of infected blood to anaemic children . The United Nations Children ' s Fund ( UNICEF ) says half the country ' s children aged five and under suffer from anaemia . Doctors remain among the country ' s lowest wage earners , with average monthly earnings equivalent to about $ 100 . Bribes to hospital staff are common practice . " I am stunned to see tuberculosis spreading again and more and more people dying of cancer and heart diseases , " Dragulescu said . " We are also witnessing a rise in child AIDS cases . " Dragulescu said improvements in health were linked to the new government ' s pledge to kick - start the economy and improve living standards which are far behind those in nearby Poland and Hungary . " It is unacceptable for a doctor to be paid less than a driver of an ambassador , " he said , comparing his monthly wage of $ 160 as a university rector with $ 400 earned by drivers at Romanian embassies . " But as long as the economy will not recover , health care will be in the same state , even worse . "

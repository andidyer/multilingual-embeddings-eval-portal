Iran ' s youth wait for new president to deliver . The children of Iran ' s 1979 Islamic revolution are waiting for new President Mohammad Khatami to deliver on promises of more social freedom . Everyday concerns of those aged between 15 and 21 take on important political significance in Iran , where the voting age is 15 and two - thirds of the population of more than 60 million are under the age of 30 . The clear message from this group is that Khatami must try to deliver on his election promises to lift some of the restrictions that penetrate most facets of daily life . " We need more freedoms and our views to be taken more seriously , " said 19 - year - old Mohammad in one of central Tehran ' s landscaped parks on Monday . The youth ' s agenda includes demands for jobs , more relaxed dress codes and a stop to the near - free reign of religious police forces who interfere in many citizens ' daily lives . Young women regularly complain about what they see as discrimination at the workplace and lack of career opportunities . " Khatami has promised much and we need equality in jobs and in our lives . . . But he has many political opponents and forces against him , " said a 25 - year - old woman student . Mohammad , his friend Nima and their girlfriends Linda and Maryam are playing a risky game in the park because they are not married or related . The four youths carry two basketballs so that when they spot a police patrol they can split off into single - sex groups and pretend not to know each other . " Patrols come into the park , arrest people and take them to their office in the park . They phone our parents and then fine us , " said Nima . The patrols are run by religious police who ensure strict observance of Islamic regulations , which include a dress codes for women requiring them to wear loose clothes covering everything but their face and hands . Patrols are regularly seen stopping traffic and publicly admonishing passengers for not observing dress codes . People of opposite sexes travelling together are asked to prove they are married or related . Fines and arrests , which often include spending a day in a police cell , are common , residents say . Police would see red if they knew the four friends regularly go to discreet private garden parties where they hear the latest in European techo - music . " I want Mr Khatami to ease off the pressure . The patrols just stop us because of the style of our shoes or because we wear make - up , " said Maryam , who allows her long pony - tail to peek through a colourful scarf . Analysts say Khatami will find it hard to ignore such concerns , which include complaints by young people that they cannot wear jeans and men cannot grow their hair long at school . Without the youth vote , Khatami would not have achieved the landslide vistory he won in the country ' s May elections , the analysts said . His election appeal came from his image as an educated moderate cleric who could curb some intrusions into the private sphere . Khatami , sworn into office on August 4 , will not be able to ignore this huge electorate and has already suggested he would appoint a vice president in charge of youth issues .

CBOT corn ends higher on funds , uncertain weather . CBOT corn futures ended higher on Friday , propelled by heavy fund buying amid ongoing concerns that hot , dry weather in the U . S . Midwest is stressing the developing crop , pit sources said . But gains were limited by midday weather updates that suggested a few scattered showers could reach central Illinois and Indiana this weekend . " I think the day was marked by a little bit more uncertainty , " John Kleist , president of the Commodity Advisory Group at Sagamore Partners , said . " There were some hints of moisture showing up in the central and southern Corn Belt . " Traders said this weekend ' s weather will be critical to crop conditions as signs of moisture stress were already visible in Missouri , Illinois and Indiana . " I can ' t believe that we haven ' t lost a fairly substantial portion of the corn yield , " said William Wiebold , agronomist at the University of Missouri . " The leaves are rolled and are actually sunburned . The tissue is actually turning gray and has been damaged because it has been so hot and dry . " Corn ended three to 3 / 4 cents per bushel higher with December up 1 - 1 / 4 at $ 2 . 69 . The December contract gained roughly 26 cents per bushel this week . Dry weather was also a continuing concern in northern China . Recent rains brought some drought relief but traders said the moisture came too late to reverse crop damage . The northern China Plains growing regions had been dry during much of the pollination period and likely caused yield losses , traders said . There was talk on the trading floor that a U . S . analytical firm had pegged China ' s corn production at 112 million tonnes . USDA in July projected China would produce 127 . 46 million tonnes . Fund buying was estimated at more than 20 million bushels , bringing the weekly tally near 150 million bushels . Traders noted CBOT data showed open interest in corn rose by roughly 18 . 7 million bushels on Thursday , suggesting that recent purchases represented new longs rather than short covering . " Funds for the week probably bought 150 million bushels of corn , " Kleist said . " There has been a decided change in ownership . " Cargill Investor Services led Friday ' s fund buying flurry , accounting for eight million bushels November , traders said . Goldenberg - Hehmeyer bought four million March and three million December while Refco Inc bought three million December . Refco also sold eight million December , sources said . Bull spreads were also active with Lind - Waldock spreading eight million September / December at two to 1 - 1 / 4 cents . LFG spread 2 . 8 million September / December at two cents . In options trade , $ 2 . 70 was the most active strike price as both the September and December flirted with that level . CIS bought 1 , 000 September $ 2 . 70 calls at six cents and sold 1 , 000 December $ 2 . 50 puts at seven cents . Prudential Securities bought 700 September calls at 6 - 1 / 2 cents and 700 September $ 2 . 80 calls at 3 - 1 / 2 to four cents . Volatility in the September closed at 32 - 3 / 4 cents , up sharply from Thursday ' s 24 - 1 / 2 . Corn futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 80 , 000 contracts , compared with Thursday ' s actual volume of 105 , 883 contracts . Options volume was pegged at 27 , 000 contracts , against Thursday ' s 36 , 896 contracts . ( ( Emily Kaiser 312 - 408 - 8749 ) )

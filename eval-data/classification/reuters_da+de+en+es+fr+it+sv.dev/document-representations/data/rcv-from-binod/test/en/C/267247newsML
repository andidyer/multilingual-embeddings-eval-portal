The Hartford drops ITT name on spinoff anniversary . ITT Hartford , whose name had caused confusion since its spinoff from ITT Corp . last year , said Thursday it was changing its name to " The Hartford " on the anniversary of its listing as an independent company . The change is to become effective immediately as the company ' s brand name , but shareholders will be asked to vote on the firm ' s legal name in May of next year . " During this first year , we have firmly established ourselves as a dynamic , international financial services company , " Donald Frahm , The Hartford ' s chairman and chief executive said in a statement . The company ' s stock price has risen by 35 percent since it ended its 25 - year marriage to ITT Corp . on December 20 of last year , Frahm said . The 186 - year - old company has also realigned itself into five core businesses to position itself for growth , he added . The nation ' s third - oldest insurer said that its research this year showed that the market and consumers were confused about who owned the company . " The Hartford and the stag have a strong brand identity , " said Connie Gurney , spokeswoman for The Hartford . " We ' re already widely known as The Hartford , and we ' re trying to capitalize on it and strengthen the brand . " As part of the image makeover , the company will launch a $ 10 - 12 million ad campaign created by Boston agency Arnold Communications early next year , said Gurney . The name change will not affect foreign subsidiaries of The Hartford . The Hartford is the nation ' s seventh - biggest property - casualty insurer and eight - biggest life insurance group . It had assets of $ 104 billion as of end September . ( ( - - Hartford newsroom ( 860 ) 727 - 0224 ) )

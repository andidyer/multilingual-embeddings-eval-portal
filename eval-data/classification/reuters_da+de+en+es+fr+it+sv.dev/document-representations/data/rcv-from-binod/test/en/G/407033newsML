Police withdraw from Albania student protest . Special police units surrounded a university building occupied by students in the southern Albanian town of Gjirokaster on Thursday but regular police officers later withdrew . Police had ordered the students to leave the building on the grounds that the hunger strike was illegal , said one witness contacted by telephone . Plainclothes police were still positioned in the area later in the evening , the witness said . Students had piled tables and chairs against doors and entrances to protect against a forced entry by police , he added . Forty - six students began a hunger strike on Thursday in solidarity with fellow students taking similar action in the southern town of Vlore . More than 600 other Gjirokaster students had occupied a nearby lecture theatre and were later joined by at least 15 lecturers . The Greek consul in Gjirokaster Nikos Kanellos met the students and told them he would inform the Athens government of their action . " I appreciate your civilised protest and I once again assure you I ' m ready to help you if needed , " he said . The Gjirokaster students , who were addressed by Berisha in the town on Wednesday , said they were unimpressed with his refusal to sack the government over its handling of a collapse of pyramid savings schemes . Tirana students also attempted to start a hunger strike but reporters saw police preventing them from entering their university building .

Surinam ' s new leader promises consensus government . Dennis SamsonSurinam ' s new President Jules Wijdenbosch , elected in a close run - off , moved quickly on Friday to dispel fears his victory would divide the country , promising a consensus government . Wijdenbosch , 55 , who is backed by former military strongman Desi Bouterse , told supporters in the early hours of Friday that he would consult with all sections of society before drawing up a government programme . " I will speak with as many people as possible from all over the country and from this we will form our programme , " he told about 2 , 000 joyous supporters at Bouterse ' s National Democratic Party ( NDP ) headquarters . His victory was expected to raise alarm in the Netherlands where the Dutch government has made its opposition to a Bouterse - sponsored government clear . The tense United People ' s Assembly ballot on Thursday ended months of political uncertainty following unclear election results in May and handed the NDP its first victory at the polls . The narrow victory over incumbent President Ronald Venetiaan by 438 votes to 407 was assured by major defections from Venetiaan ' s New Front coalition . Those who joined the NDP did so on condition that Bouterse would hold no public office . But many feel Wijdenbosch , a close friend of Bouterse who held key government posts under the military regime , will essentially be controlled by the 50 - year - old former dictator . Willy Soemita , who led his Indonesian Party of Unity and Solidarity ( KTPI ) out of the government to support Wijdenbosch , twice slipped and congratulated " Our new President Desi Bouterse . . . " in a speech on Thursday night . Wijdenbosch ' s victory evoked memories of Bouterse ' s military regime , which led the South American country into civil war and political isolation in the 1980s and provoked an armed uprising that lasted six years , cost more than 500 lives and saw about 15 , 000 people seek exile . A bitterly disappointed Ronny Brunswijk , who led that rebellion , told Reuters he would respect the new government only if it stuck to promises in a 1992 agreement that ended the civil war . Opposition politicians charged that Wijdenbosch would lead the country to financial ruin . Wijdenbosch , named by Bouterse as vice - president and finance minister , ran a lax fiscal policy as the government spent heavily on populist measures in an effort to garner support ahead of 1991 elections , running central bank reserves down to zero . Surinam , a multi - racial country of 400 , 000 , is one of the world ' s biggest bauxite producers . But civil war and a tough economic programme launched in 1993 have cut gross domestic product per capita from $ 3 , 000 to $ 1 , 200 in the last 15 years . Wijdenbosch , who will be sworn in Sept 14 for a five - year term , insisted that " as of tomorrow work has to start " on re - building the country ' s economy .

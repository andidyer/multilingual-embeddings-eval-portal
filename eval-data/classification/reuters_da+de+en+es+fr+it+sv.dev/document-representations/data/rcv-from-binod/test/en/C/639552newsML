Polish KGHM tentative price range at PLN 15 - 23 . Poland set a tentative price range for the privatisation offering of its KGHM Polska Miedz SA copper concern at between 15 and 23 zlotys per share , KGHM ' s president said on Thursday . " The price brackets have been set at between 15 and 23 zlotys . . . but the final price range might still be changed , " Stanislaw Siewierski told a news conference . Poland is offering up to 36 percent of its only copper producer with up to 32 . 5 percent or 65 million shares out of KGHM ' s existing 200 million shares on offer to domestic and foreign investors on subscription scheduled for June 30 - July 4 . Siewierski said book building among large domestic and foreign managers would determine a minimum price for the final bids for large investors and that the final strike price for them would be determined on the basis of offers . He said small retail players would buy shares at about a three percent discount to the minimum price to the large investor and foreign offer . " There is an incentive for small investors as they will be offered a three percent discount from the minimum price and that is the only preference for small players , " he said . Siewierski said that the price range for book building could still be changed ahead of the offer and that the final strike price could be set above the minimum price if demand proved strong enough . - - Warsaw Newsroom + 48 22 653 9700

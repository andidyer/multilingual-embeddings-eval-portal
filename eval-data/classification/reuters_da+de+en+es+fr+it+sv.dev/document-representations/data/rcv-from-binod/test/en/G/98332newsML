Indian protestors threaten beauty contest venue . An Indian farmers ' group in the southern city of Bangalore has vowed to set fire to the venue where the Miss World beauty contest is due to be staged next month . " We will set it ablaze . There is no way we will allow the contest to be held here , " said Nanjundaswamy , head of the militant farmers ' association in southern Karnataka state . India , a witness to a fast growing fashion industry , will be hosting the beauty pageant for the first time after a firm owned by Hindi film superstar Amitabh Bachchan secured contracts for the event . Since then various women organisations have protested against the event , saying it degraded women and would insult Indian culture . The main focus of anger is the swimsuit parade . Several women ' s groups have also threatened mass suicide if the event is not scrapped . " We will burn the stage and not allow the show . If we fail , we will go ahead with our plan to commit suicide , " said K . N . Sasikala , president of Mahila Jagarna ( Forum to Awaken Women ) . The groups have also complained to the local government of Karnataka , saying the event might " project the glamarous image of womanhood but was an insult to a vast majority of toiling women " . The government of Karnataka , the home state of Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda , has rejected the protests .

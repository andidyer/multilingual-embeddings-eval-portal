Iran moving closer to nuclear arms - U . S . general . Iran is moving closer to nuclear weapons capability and is likely to have such arms at or shortly after the turn of the century , the Army general in charge of U . S . forces in the Gulf said on Thursday . " I would predict to you that would be sometime at the turn of the century , in the near end of the turn of the century , " Army Gen . Binford Peay told reporters . He said such capability could be delayed only by Tehran ' s ability to get fissionable material for nuclear arms . Peay , who heads the U . S . Central Command with responsibility for American forces in the volatile Gulf , declined to be more specific . But he also voiced concern that Iran ' s current conventional buildup of submarines and cruise missiles might spark an accidental confrontation in the Gulf . " I wouldn ' t want to put a date on it . I don ' t know if it ' s 2010 , 2007 , 2003 . I ' m just saying that I think it ' s ( nuclear weapons ) coming closer , " he said in response to questions in an interview with reporters . " Your instincts tell you that that ' s the kind of speed that they are moving on today across the board in their biological and chemical and nuclear and conventional fields , " Peay said . Defence Secretary William Cohen said during a Gulf visit last week that Iran this month successfully tested air - launched anti - ship cruise missiles obtained from China and he warned Tehran against trying to halt shipping from the oil - rich Gulf . Peay said on Thursday that such missiles had cut down the reaction time of U . S . naval forces in the region but that both the U . S . and Iranian militaries were trying to assure that an accidental incident did not occur in the tense region . " It ' s a concern , " he said . " Politically , we ( the United States ) have sent the signal that our nation is not trying to have a fight with Iran . " Peay is scheduled to be replaced in August as head of the Central Command based in Tampa , Florida , and said again on Thursday that he did not feel he and other senior U . S . officers should be held responsible for negligence over a truck bomb that killed 19 U . S . airmen at Dhahran , Saudi Arabia , last June 25 . Cohen is now deciding whether to punish Air Force Brig . Gen . Terryl Schwalier , who was responsible for forces in Saudi Arabia , at the time of the bombing . A Pentagon report issued last year was scathing in putting responsibility for the explosion on senior officers on the scene and at the Pentagon , saying that not enough had been done to protect American troops from attack . But a subsequent Air Force report absolved Schwalier and other senior officers of any blame . It said they did all that they could , given the information they had at the time on possible threats .

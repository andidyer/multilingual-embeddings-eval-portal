Executive to run as independent in Singapore poll . The head of a garment manufacturing and retailing company said on Thursday he wanted to stand as an independent candidate in Singapore ' s next general election . Chia Shi Teck , executive chairman of Heshe Holdings Ltd , told a news conference he intended to put together a team of like - minded independents to stand as a slate against the government in a multi - member constituency . If he could not find enough people to stand with him in one of the city - state ' s Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) , he would probably stand alone in a single - member seat , he said . The governing People ' s Action Party ( PAP ) holds 75 seats in Singapore ' s 81 - seat parliament , most of which are elected through GRCs . There are currently four opposition MPs , all of them in single - member constituences . " This is be the first time an independent has proposed to run with a slate , " Chia said . Chia said he supported most of the PAP ' s policies and did not want to oppose the government . But he thought independent members of parliament still were needed . " I am a proposition , not an opposition . I hope to propose ideas , not oppose them , " he said . " The PAP is a very good government , but I want to add value . " Singapore ' s next general election , which Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong must call by April 1997 , is widely expected to be held in January . Chia , 48 , was an unelected MP between 1992 and 1994 , after being nominated by the government under a plan to introduce independent voices into parliament .

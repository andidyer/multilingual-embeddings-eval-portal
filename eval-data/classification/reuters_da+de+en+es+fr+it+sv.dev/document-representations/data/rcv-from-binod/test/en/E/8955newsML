Sickly UK manufacturing recovering slowly - CBI . Britain ' s sickly manufacturing sector showed a slight sign of recovery in August with firms reporting a modest rise in overall demand , the Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) said on Friday . But its August Industrial Trends survey found orders are still well below normal levels for the time of year , hit in particular by sluggish demand for British goods abroad . Only 19 percent of firms saw orders rise compared with 29 percent who saw them fall . Firms have regarded orders as below normal for the time of year for 12 months in a row . " Although manufacturing demand has improved to its best level so far this year , companies will find it difficult to raise more than one cheer , " said Sudhir Junankar , associate director of economic analysis at the CBI . He said total order books remain significantly below normal despite some improvement in home demand . The survey showed demand from overseas has weakened further leaving export order books in their worst state since February 1994 . Junankar said the European market in particular showed little sign of improvement with France and Germany very weak . Excessive levels of stocks continued to dog the industry , but fewer firms than last month reported stocks of finished goods are more than adequate to meet expected demand . Given the persistently low level of demand , firms said they did not expect to raise their prices over the next four months . - - Rosemary Bennett + 44 171 542 7715

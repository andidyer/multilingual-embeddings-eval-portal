CME hog and pork belly futures calls range mixed . Early calls on CME hog futures ranged from 0 . 100 cent a lb lower to 0 . 100 higher while pork belly futures indications ranged from 0 . 200 cent a lb higher to 0 . 200 lower , livestock analysts said . Some analysts look for renewed pressure in hog futures following weaker - than - expected early cash hog indications . However , others look for a further correction from recent sharp losses . Pork cutout values have stabilized somewhat and there could be a winter storm moving through the Midwest early next week which would hamper hog movement , they said . The CME lean index was off $ 1 . 07 at $ 78 . 12 per cwt . Although cash belly prices remain steady to firm and futures are at too small a premium to encourage hedging , some analysts look for mixed trade in pork belly futures . Futures look overbought after Thursday ' s sharp gains and the hog kill on Thursday was larger than expected , they said . Hog slaughter has been running about five percent under the year ago - level which made for firm cash belly prices as storage interests competed with slicers , they said . USDA estimated week - to - date hog slaughter through Thursday at 1 , 415 , 000 head , below 1 , 433 , 000 a week ago and 1 , 433 , 000 a year ago . ( ( Jerry Bieszk 312 - 408 - 8725 ) )

Egypt denies having military ties with Zaire . A senior Egyptian official said on Tuesday there has been no military cooperation for more than a decade between Cairo and Zaire which is fighting a Tutsi - led rebel campaign . Assistant Foreign Minister for African Affairs Marwan Badr was responding to an announcement in Kinshasa on Monday that Egypt had sent military equipment to help the government in its fight against the rebels . " There has been no military cooperation with Zaire since the 1980s , " Badr told reporters . " Zaire has asked for political support to reach a solution ( to the fighting ) , " he added . A senior Zairean defence ministry official also said on Monday that troops from Morocco , Togo and Chad were expected to help the army contain a rebel campaign that has spread to the mineral - producing Shaba Province . " Togo , Morocco and Chad are all prepared to send troops along with materials . Egypt has offered materials mostly to equip the infantry , " the Zairean official , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters . Tutsi - led rebels battling the Zaire army since October have extended their campaign and territory they hold from the borders of Rwanda and Uganda to Zaire ' s mineral - rich Shaba Province . Zaire accuses Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi of fighting along with ethnic Tutsis who launched an armed rebellion after local authorities threatened to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda .

Zaire rebel chief reports more battlefield progress . Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila reported more battlefield victories on Saturday after rejecting international mediation in the conflict with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko . Kabila told Reuters there was fighting in Punia , about 70 km ( 45 miles ) south of Lubutu , and that his forces entered the town early on Friday . Defence officials in Kinshasa admitted late on Friday that Punia , which guards the road to the key government - held city of Kisangani , was in danger of falling . Kabila ' s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo - Zaire ( ADFL ) has steadily eroded Mobutu ' s control in eastern Zaire since the rebellion began last October . The Alliance now claims to control a narrow border strip about 1 , 400 km ( 875 miles ) long . Mobutu returned home on Friday after medical tests for his prostate cancer in Europe and a three - day working visit to Morocco , a longtime ally . Leaving after talks with King Hassan , Mobutu denied he had asked for Moroccan troops and military material to combat the rebels , accused by Zaire of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda . But Kabila claimed to know Hassan had turned down Mobutu ' s request for troops and thanked the Moroccan monarch . " Our information is accurate and it indicates that Mobutu got nothing out of King Hassan . The King politely refused to send troops to Zaire but instead gave Mobutu confusing promises to supply him with some equipment , " Kabila added on Saturday . Kabila , who believes the end of Mobutu ' s 32 - year rule is approaching , on Friday rejected international mediation to end Africa ' s latest war . He said the war was an internal matter that must be resolved by the Zaireans . He was responding to calls from several African nations for international mediation in the war sparked off by Zairean attempts to expel the Banyamulenge - - an ethnic Tutsi group - - back to Rwanda , a land they left up to 200 years ago . The Banyamulenge took up arms to resist the expulsions and joined Kabila , a veteran opposition figure against Mobutu . Kabila said he was only willing to meet Mobutu on a one - to - one basis to discuss Mobutu ' s handover of power . The U . N . Security Council in New York expressed grave concern on Friday over the deteriorating situation in Central Africa and warned states to stay out of Zaire ' s civil war . " We are not at all interested in the internationalisation of the Zairean conflict . There is no need for international or regional mediation in our conflict , " Kabila said . " Mobutu must come and talk to us on how to hand over power , otherwise we shall continue with the military campaign and remove him . " On Friday the rebel leader said his forces were also besieging the airfield and army base at Kindu , one of two bases for Kinshasa ' s counter - offensive , saying his forces expected to take Kindu in the next few days . Kabila said his forces continued to advance on several fronts and had captured the refugee camp of Amisi outside the town of Lubutu , gateway to Kisangani . He reported advances in the north around the town of Isiro near the Sudan - Uganda border , and in the south on the town of Moba , a potential launchpad to attack government forces defending mineral - rich Shaba province . Kabila dismissed reports of government troops recapturing Shabunda and Watsa as " reckless propaganda by the government in Kinshasa " .

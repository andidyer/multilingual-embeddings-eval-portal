Seafresh confident of strong fishing year . Seafresh New Zealand Ltd said on Monday it was confident of a strong performance in the fishing year beginning October 1 , 1996 . Catches had already exceeded expectations , and a significant increase in revenue was expected from the upgraded squid fishing operation , the company said . Seafresh earlier reported a loss of NZ $ 2 . 39 million in the 15 months to September 30 . Net profit before tax had been NZ $ 2 . 02 million for the year , exceeding the revised profit projection announced in September . Seafresh had decided to write off of half of the goodwill arising out of the acquisition of the Seafresh fishing business in January 1996 . As a result , NZ $ 3 . 7 million had been written off against operating profit , leaving a book loss of $ 2 . 4 million . Net profit after tax was NZ $ 1 . 33 million . Turnover for the period reached NZ $ 21 million , down on the $ 26 million recorded last year , reflecting the percentage of the increased value of the New Zealand dollar . Seafresh said the year saw significant expansion of both the company - owned and joint venture fishing fleets , onshore processing facilities and markets . It has recently invested in a substantial parcel of squid quota to give greater access to this species . The company had negotiated for 17 squid jigging vessels to be chartered along with two freighters to ship the catches overseas . - - Wellington Newsroom ( 64 4 ) 4734746

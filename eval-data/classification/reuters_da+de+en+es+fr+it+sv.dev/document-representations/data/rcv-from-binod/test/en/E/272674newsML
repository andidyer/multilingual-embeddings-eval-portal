FORECAST - S . AFRICAN GROWTH SEEN AT 3 PCT IN 1997 . The latest survey by the University of Stellenbosch ' s Bureau for Economic Research indicated that the South African economy could repeat this year ' s expected growth of about three percent in 1997 . BER said that although recent interest rate hikes were likely to further dampen private expenditure , inventory investment and some fixed investment , it still expected growth of about three percent in 1997 . It said it had detected a marked improvement in business confidence while the rand ' s sharp depreciation in 1996 should have an overall stimulatory impact on the economy in 1997 . BER said its manufacturing survey results were encouraging . Increases in production and order volumes exceeded more neutral expectations and business confidence improved markedly . " This is a welcome relative improvement in manufacturing business conditions , " BER said . " However , it could be premature to identify a recovery . The situation appears to be stabilising , though , and prospects for a bottoming out towards the second half of 1997 remain in place . " In certain consumer goods industries such as food , beverages , wood and furniture , business conditions improved . In others such as textiles , clothing and footwear , however , business conditions remained weak . The slowdown of general demand conditions also filtered through to some heavier industries such as rubber , plastics , non - metal minerals , base metals and electric machinery . " It is encouraging , however , that almost all of the major manufacturing groups expounded optimistic 12 month export expectations , " BER said . " These positive aspects should , however , we weighed against the rather bearish 12 month outlook for general business conditions . " This outlook was based on an uncertain political climate , lacklustre demand conditions and high short - term interest rates . There appeared to be substantial spare production capacity and high stock levels while the outlook for order volumes in the first quarter of 1997 was " not that bright " . Real fixed investment had continued and was linked to exports but employment conditions remained weak , which would be a general drag on economic activity . The BER found that business confidence in the new vehicle and retail trade increased in the fourth quarter . But in the wholesale trade , confidence dropped from a high level in the third quarter to a low level in the fourth quarter as sales volume expectations failed to be realised . " Wholesalers do not expect much of an increase in their volume of sales during the first quarter , " BER said . Retailers and the new vehicle trade reported a surge in sales in the fourth quarter , which was " somewhat surprising " as respondents had expected the decline of the third quarter to continue . " Respondents , however , consider this a temporary upsurge in sales or a deviation from the downward trend , " BER said . - - Cape Town newsroom + 27 21 25 - 2238

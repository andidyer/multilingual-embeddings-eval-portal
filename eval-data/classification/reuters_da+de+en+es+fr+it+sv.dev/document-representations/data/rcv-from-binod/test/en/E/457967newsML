Strikes , bankruptcies dash S . Korean economic hopes . The failure of two big steelmakers and almost a month of labour strikes have dashed hopes for an economic revival in South Korea this year , a central bank official said on Thursday . The bank has lowered estimates for gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth this year to 6 . 0 percent from 6 . 4 percent , deputy bank governor Kim Young - dae said . He told reporters the economy appeared to have hit bottom , but there were no signs of a quick recovery . " Conditions have worsened since we made our first forecast late last year , " Kim said . " Strikes in January , the Hanbo collapse and Sammi ' s failure have all had a negative impact on the economy . " " Previously , we thought the economy would rebound in the second half of this year . But that possibility has fizzled . " Hanbo Steel Co went under in January with $ 5 . 8 billion in debts in the country ' s biggest corporate failure . On Tuesday , Sammi Steel Co filed for court protection along with a sister company . The failures hit an economy already reeling from strikes sparked by the passage last December of a labour law that made layoffs easier . The bill was watered down and a new version was adopted this month . Some of the worst industrial unrest in South Korean history cost the country $ 3 . 28 billion in lost production . Corporations are suffering from an export downturn and heavier financing costs . Overseas borrowing rates have gone up as the local currency sinks and foreign lenders become jittery over the health of South Korean banks . Some private economic think - tanks are predicting economic growth this year of 5 . 0 percent , the lowest since 1980 . Separately , Finance Minister Kang Kyong - shik said he could offer no quick fix . " I ' m sorry to say this , but I have no remedy to instantly end economic difficulties we are suffering , " he told an eagerly awaited news conference . There was " no room for short - term boosting measures " . " Even if the growth rate is lowered to the five - percent - level , we will have to endure it and make efforts to correct our economy ' s structure by stressing price stability and improving the balance of payments , " Kang said . Financial markets had been hoping Kang would offer concrete steps to boost economic growth and cut the trade deficit . Kang said tax revenues and government spending this year would be slashed as part of belt - tightening measures to keep inflation under control as the economy slowed . The government would cut two trillion won ( $ 2 . 26 billion ) from this year ' s budgeted tax revenues and reduce public spending by an additional one trillion won on top of an earlier announced one trillion won cut . Inflation is now running at below five percent , the same rate as last year . Budget growth would be held in single digits next year after a 13 . 7 percent rise this year , Kang said . Savings would come from job cuts and administrative reorganisation . The central bank said GDP grew 7 . 1 percent in 1996 against an 8 . 9 percent rise in 1995 . Private - sector consumption , investment and exports all slowed in 1996 . Exports rose 14 . 1 percent , down from a 24 percent gain a year earlier , while imports rose 14 . 8 percent against a 22 . 0 percent rise in 1995 . Last year ' s current account deficit ballooned to $ 23 . 72 billion against $ 8 . 95 billion in 1995 , according to earlier central bank figures .

Pulp firm ' s new Tongass offer draws mixed reviews . With the shutdown of its money - losing Ketchikan pulp mill likely , Louisiana - Pacific Corp . has offered to keep its two Alaska saw mills open as long as the federal government keeps a controversial timber - supply contract intact . That plan , submitted to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman last week , would save some 500 jobs that would otherwise be lost if Louisiana - Pacific unit Ketchikan Pulp Co . pulls out of southeast Alaska entirely . " This proposal is offered in good faith as a route to maintain a portion of the economy of southeast Alaska despite the shutdown of the pulp mill which is the centrepiece around which the economy has been built over the past 42 years , " Mark Suwyn , Louisiana - Pacific chief executive , said in a letter to Glickman . But the proposal contradicts the intent of the contract for timber from the Tongass National Forest , the largest U . S . national forest . The 50 - year contract , set to run out in 2004 , was set up to guarantee operation of a pulp mill to provide local employment and a market for low - quality wood . For the rest of Alaska ' s timber industry , the pulp mill - - not Louisiana - Pacific ' s saw mills , which use high - grade timber desired by other companies - - is the key benefit of the contract , one official said . " The Ketchikan Pulp mill has always provided a home for the low - end log , which is a difficult log to get rid of , " said John Sturgeon , chief executive of Anchorage - based Koncor Forest Products . " To have the pulp mill go away is very , very disturbing to us . " For several weeks , Lousiana - Pacific has been threatening to close the pulp mill unless Congress and the Clinton administration grant a 15 - year extension of the timber supply contract . The Ketchikan plant , the largest private employer in the southeast Alaksa city of 15 , 000 , is expected to lose at least $ 40 million this year , Ketchikan Pulp spokesman Troy Reinhart said . Under the new Louisiana - Pacific proposal , negotiations over a possible contract extension would be deferred . Louisiana - Pacific said its new offer would reduce Ketchikan Pulp ' s annual timber consumption from 192 . 5 million board feet to 165 million board feet . U . S . Forest Service officials have said Ketchikan Pulp is guaranteed only about 150 million board feet a year from the existing contract . One environmentalist scoffed at Lousiana - Pacific ' s latest offer . " KPC is giving up timber that it doesn ' t have and asking for timber it ' s not entitled to , " said Buck Lindekugel of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council .

NYPA shuts Indian Pt 3 nuke early for maintenance . The New York Power Authority ( NYPA ) said Thursday it has shut its 965 megawatt ( MW ) Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant for scheduled maintenance and refueling one day ahead of its original plan . " We ' re going into this ( outage ) a day and half early , " said company spokesman Joe Leary . Plant engineers decided to manually shut the unit after control room instrumentation showed increased temperature inside the reactor as the plant was coasting down for its scheduled outage , Leary said . " It ' s expected to be in cold shutdown tomorrow evening , " he added . The outage is expected to end in mid - July , he said . " We ' re looking at the outage to last two months . " The adjacent 975 MW unit 2 , operated by Consolidated Edison Co , was shut May 1 for a 43 - day refueling shutdown . The Indian Point units are located just north of New York City .

Benetton firm confirms Autostrade interest . Gilberto Benetton , chairman of the Benetton family ' s Edizione Holding , confirmed the holding was interested in taking a stake in Italy ' s motorway operator Autostrade , which is due to be privatised this year . He told reporters at the annual general meeting of Edizione ' s Benetton clothing group , " I think Autostrade represents a good business , " but added that its interest was for the moment just general and within a scenario of diversification of the family holding . He said earlier this month Edizione was interested in taking a considerable stake in Societa Autostrade , which is owned by state industrial holding IRI and due to be sold this year . Through another Edizione unit , the roadside catering company Autogrill , the group already has restaurant licensing agreements with Autostrade . Autostrade ' s privatisation had been due before the end of June but the head of one of the banks handling the operation , IMI , said earlier on Tuesday the sale may be delayed . - - Milan newsroom + 392 66129589

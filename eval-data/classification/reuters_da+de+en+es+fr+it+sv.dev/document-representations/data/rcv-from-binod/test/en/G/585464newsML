FORMER WORLD BOXING CHAMP BENN CLEARED OF ASSAULT . British former world boxing champion Nigel Benn was cleared on Thursday of attacking a former close friend and cornerman with a glass ashtray in a London night club . Benn , 33 , had pleaded not guilty to charges of intent to cause grievous bodily harm and of unlawful wounding . The London crown court had heard that Ray Sullivan required more than 100 stitches after the attack in October 1996 , which he said had sliced him open " like a pair of curtains " . Benn , known as the Dark Destroyer before his retirement in 1996 , told the court he was sitting 20 feet ( 6 metres ) away when Sullivan was attacked in the " Legends " night club . The former World Boxing Council super - middleweight champion said he had enjoyed a peaceful night out celebrating the birth of his girlfriend ' s twins . Bouncers whisked him away when a scuffle broke out , he said .

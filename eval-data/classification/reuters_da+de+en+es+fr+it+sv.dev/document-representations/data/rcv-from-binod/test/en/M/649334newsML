S . Africa rand / bonds closing report . Late South African bond yields were near their softest levels as PPI - inspired glee was replaced by glumness over the weaker rand . " The rand ' s looking a bit poor so the market is nervous and ( is also affected by ) that U . S . long bond , it ' s strengthening and then its weakening and so on which gives no clear trend . This market ' s going to be jittery for while , " said one bond dealer in Johannesburg . The R150 benchmark loan perked up to an intraday best of 14 . 595 around 0930 GMT after the release of producer price inflation data showing April ' s index up 0 . 4 percent after 0 . 1 rise in March . The resulting year - on - year rise in April was 8 . 8 percent after March ' s 9 . 6 percent rise versus a consensus forecast of 9 . 5 percent . But the fuss subsided in the afternoon and bonds along with it , leaving the R150 yield at 14 . 660 percent , up from Monday ' s 1430 GMT level of 14 . 590 . Debt traders said the overall mood was likely to remain muted as fears of capital flight persisted with the approaching July 1 deadline for the loosening of exchange controls . " That PPI figure was excellent and it confirms that the long term trend in rates is down , but that ' s long term . In the short term there ' s July 1 to get past . I don ' t think many will go long bonds before then , " noted one . The rand had a jittery day against the dollar after Monday ' s relatively orderly move through the 4 . 50 rand level . At 1400 GMT , the unit was priced at 4 . 5010 / 5040 , a whisker lower than Monday ' s late price of 4 . 5000 / 5030 but off its intraday worst on late exporter interest . " A few exporters have seen the rand go to 4 . 5040 and picked it up cheap but it ' s still very rangebound for the time being , " said one forex dealer . Dealers said higher volatilities in the rand options market reinforced the underlying nervousness about the local currency . The unit had mixed fortunes in cross rate trade . It was last quoted at 0 . 3807 / 3810 marks from 0 . 3793 / 3797 marks Monday , 7 . 3783 / 3877 on sterling from 7 . 3481 / 3575 previously and at 24 . 9906 / 0206 against the yen from 25 . 0194 / 0583 . South Africa ' s money market shortage rose to 7 . 190 billion rand on Monday from 6 . 427 billion rand on Saturday , the Reserve Bank said . On the money market , three - month NCD rates were stable at 16 . 05 percent offered , while the 90 - day BA rate was pegged at between 15 . 45 to 15 . 60 percent , also no different from Monday ' s late levels . Foreigners were net buyers of 346 . 63 million rand ' s worth of South African bonds on Monday after buying 167 . 56 million rand ' s worth on Friday , the Bond Exchange said . Nominal cumulative bond market volumes rose to 8 . 29 billion rand on Monday from 5 . 08 billion rand on Friday . - - Justin McCamish , Johannesburg newsroom + 27 11 482 - 1003

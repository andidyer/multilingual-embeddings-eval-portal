UK watchdog wants 2 - yr price curb on power supply . British power regulator Stephen Littlechild said on Monday that domestic and small business electricity customers would be protected by a two - year price cap after the electricity supply market is liberalised . Littlechild is half way through a consulation period with companies and other interested parties , due to end around summer 1997 , working out how to allow 25 million people in England , Scotland and Wales to shop around for their electricity . Littlechild said that a two - year price restraint should apply to electricity supply companies serving domestic and small business customers who use 8 , 000 to 20 , 000 kWh . With competition not expected overnight after the liberalisation date of April 1 , 1998 , the regulator is keen to protect those customers traditionally slower to move accounts to rivals when monopolies are slowly broken down . " We want to ensure that smaller customers are no worse off after competition than they were before , " a spokeswoman for Littlechild ' s office Offer said . Littlechild asked companies for information about their costs and business plans and said he would be analysing and discussing this information over the next few months . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7987

Widow asks court to let her use husband ' s sperm . A widow fighting to have a baby through artificial insemination using her dead husband ' s sperm took her case to Britain ' s High Court on Wednesday . The 30 - year - old woman , identified only as Mrs B , is contesting a refusal by the national Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) to allow the procedure because her husband did not give his written consent for it before he died . In a case that has sparked national debate , her lawyer told the court the HFEA had taken a narrow approach and " to destroy the sperm without good reason would be undeniably wanton " . " It is a crucial part of her husband . His genetic material is alive and in storage , " said Anthony Lester . " The humane course would be to allow insemination . " The woman has claimed that she and her husband had been trying for a year to have a baby before he died from bacterial meningitis . The sperm was taken from him at her request while he was on a life - support machine in a coma . " This is not a case about disregarding the wishes of the deceased husband . It is a case of furthering those wishes , " Lester said . " It is a case about advances in medical science being able to help his widow to have the child which they both so much wanted . " The HFEA , a regulatory body , argues that it would be illegal under the the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to allow the procedure in Britain or abroad without the husband ' s written consent . " They regarded themselves and their bodies as joined together in holy matrimony as part of one another , " Lester said . " They always intended to have children , regarding procreation as the central purpose of marriage and human life . " The couple , from the British Midlands , were married in 1991 . Her parents , as well as her husband ' s , support her fight to try to have his child . The case will continue on Thursday .

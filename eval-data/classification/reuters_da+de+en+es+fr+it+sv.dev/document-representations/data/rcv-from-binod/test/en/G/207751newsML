Earthlings find Mars rocks too expensive . Rocks from Mars were offered at an unprecedented auction on Wednesday but no one on Earth was willing to buy them . " We are unable to sell the lot , " said Arlan Ettinger , president of Guernsey ' s , the auction house that conducted the sale at New York City ' s 7th Regiment Armory on Park Avenue . " We are very disappointed that the meteorites did not sell tonight , " Ettinger said . It took only a matter of minutes for the opening bid of $ 500 , 000 to go to $ 1 . 1 million , the highest offer for the collection of three Martian meteorites . But apparently that was not enough of the green stuff for a piece of the red planet . Ettinger said that was not the price the collector was expecting to get for the rocks . There are just 90 pounds ( 40 . 82 kg ) of Mars rocks known to exist on Earth , according to experts consulted by Guernsey ' s . All but eight pounds ( 3 . 6 kg ) are owned by various governments and museums . What made Wednesday ' s meteorite sale noteworthy was that it contained all three known types of Martian meteorites , Ettinger said . Each type is named for where it was discovered : Shergottite ( Shergotty , India ) , Nakhlite ( Nakhla , Egypt ) and Chassignite ( Chassigny , France ) . Scientists believe that the type of meteorite that has life is a Shergottite . The rocks ranged from grapefruit - to golf ball - size . Separately , Phillips auction house plans to sell three fragments of meteorites from Mars in New York as part of a natural history auction on December 10 . " The rocks tonight were simply overpriced , " David Herskowitz of the Phillips auction house said at the end of the sale .

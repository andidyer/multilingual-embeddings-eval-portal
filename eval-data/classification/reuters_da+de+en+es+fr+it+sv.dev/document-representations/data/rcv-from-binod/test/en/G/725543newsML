Albright confident Czechs can contribute to NATO . U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , on an emotional visit to her native Prague , said on Monday she was confident the Czech Republic would do everything necessary to be ready for NATO membership . Albright , visiting Prague after NATO last week invited the Czech Republic and two other Eastern European states to join the alliance , said Czech leaders understood that first - class NATO membership would require a first - class contribution . " I am confident that the Czech Republic is ready to take the responsibility as a mature democracy for the wellbeing and security of others , " she told a news conference after talks with Czech political leaders . Albright said , in answer to a question , the Czechs would have to streamline and modernise their armed forces and that by 2000 they should be spending two percent of gross domestic product on defence . Defence spending is currently about 1 . 7 percent of GDP , and the government has said it wants to meet a target of two percent of GDP in the coming years . " We would also expect that the Czechs would take an even stricter look at its export control laws to make sure there is no trade with the rogue states , " she said , flanked by President Vaclav Havel . However , she said the Czech armed forces had performed magnificently in dealing with severe floods which have hit the north and east of the country in the past week . She said the U . S . government had offered help and added , " That is what friends are for . " Albright , who was born in Prague in 1937 and speaks Czech , was unhappy with some of the translation of her remarks . " Not exactly , " she said after a tribute to President Vaclav Havel had not been translated as she wished . After repeating the phrase in English , she then delivered her own Czech version . She later corrected another phrase and eventually the humilated interpreter stood aside and allowed Havel ' s personal interpreter to translate the rest of the news conference . Albright ' s first visit to Prague since taking on her new post has already proved an emotional affiar . On Sunday , she visited Prague ' s Jewish quarter and saw the names of her paternal grandparents on the memorial walls of a synagogue dedicated to some 80 , 000 Czechoslovak Jews who died in the Holocaust . Albright , who says she only recently became aware of her Jewish origins , said the image of the names " would for ever be seared into my heart " . Albright , whose family twice fled the former Czechoslovakia , met her only known relative in the Czech Republic , cousin Dagmar Simova , in her hotel on Monday . Simova ' s husband , Vladimir Sima , confirmed they had met but declined to say what was discussed . Simova lived with the young Albright after her father , diplomat Josef Korbel , escaped occupied Czechoslovakia for London in World War Two . " Of the various unbelieveable things that have happened in the last 10 years the fact that I am standing here , Czech - born and Secretary of State of the United States , is a great privilege , " Albright told the news conference . Prague has long seen Albright as a powerful friend and supporter of their NATO membership . " Let me say how moved I am that it is a secretary of Czech origin who has come to us to discuss an issue of such importance , " Havel said . Later she received the Czechs ' highest civilian award , the Order of the White Lion " for especially oustanding endeavour to the benefit of the Czech Republic " . Albright was later due to deliver a speech in Prague ' s Municipal House and have a private meeting with Havel before leaving for Washington .

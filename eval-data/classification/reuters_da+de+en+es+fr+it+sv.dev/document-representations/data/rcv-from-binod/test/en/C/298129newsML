Egypt seeking contractors for $ 150 mln canal bridge . The Egyptian government is inviting Egyptian and Japanese companies to tender from next week for a 500 million pound ( $ 150 million ) project to build a suspension bridge over the Suez Canal . The bridge , set 70 metres ( 230 feet ) above the water so that the largest ships can pass , will be the first overland road link between Africa and Asia since the canal was built in the 1860s . The only links between African Egypt and the Sinai peninsula are now the Ahmed Hamdi tunnel and a series of seven ferries . Fouad Abdel Aziz Khalil , chairman of the government ' s General Authority for Roads and Bridges , said four Egyptian companies had prequalified for one part of the project and that only Japanese firms would be eligible for the rest of the work . " That ' s because the financing will be grant aid ( from Japan ) , " he told Reuters on Thursday . But a spokesman for the Japanese embassy in Cairo said Tokyo had not yet given a commitment to finance the project , beyond the amount granted for the feasibility studies . Egyptian and Japanese officials have repeatedly contradicted each other on the financing . The Egyptians say the Japanese will pay many of the costs , the Japanese that nothing is decided . Official documents on the project say that an Egyptian contractor will build the approach bridges , up to a height of 49 . 5 metres ( 162 feet ) , and a Japanese contractor the rest of the approach bridges and the main bridge itself . Khalil declined to say how he expected the costs to break down between the two parts of the project . He also declined to give the deadline for tenders . The bridge , with four lanes , will be near the town of Qantara , 47 km ( 29 miles ) south of Port Said city . It will serve mainly northern Sinai , where the government is planning to irrigate 400 , 000 acres ( 160 , 000 hectares ) . The population of all Sinai is expected to rise to 3 . 2 million in 2017 from a few hundred thousand today . The documents say traffic across the canal is expected to reach 50 , 000 vehicles a day in 2015 . The ferries can take 12 , 000 and the tunnel about 10 , 000 , leaving 28 , 000 for the bridge . They say it will take 42 months to build the bridge , including six months for preparations . In a gesture to Egyptian style , the main pylons , 160 metres ( 525 feet ) high , will be shaped like obelisks .

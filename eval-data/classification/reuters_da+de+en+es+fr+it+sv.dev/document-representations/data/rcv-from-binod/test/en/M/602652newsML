FOCUS - European stocks rise on unchanged U . S . rates . European stock markets rose on Wednesday after the U . S . Federal Reserve decided against raising interest rates , although some investors believed it was only delaying the day when rates would inevitably rise . On the foreign exchange markets , the dollar was mostly steady after a fall triggered when the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , the policy arm of the U . S . central bank , announced on Tuesday that short term rates were unchanged . Markets had been divided over whether the FOMC would raise the Fed Funds rate by 0 . 25 percentage points as a pre - emptive strike against inflation . The FOMC decision on no change boosted Wall Street , which in turn lifted the leading European markets . The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down 70 points at Tuesday ' s European close , later rose to close up 74 . 58 points or 1 . 03 percent at 7 , 303 . 46 . But the mood remained cautious , particularly in London . " Everything is bright and breezy this morning but it is a bit of a knee jerk reaction , " said one dealer . One trader who deals in U . S . shares said : " In a couple of weeks people will start worrying about higher rates but for now the Dow looks like it will set new highs . " Some investors believed that , by delaying a move , the Fed would have to raise rates more when the FOMC next meets in early July . But this view was not universally shared . The FTSE 100 index of blue chips was up 32 . 3 points or 0 . 70 percent to 4 , 639 . 8 by midday on Wednesday . But domestic issues were also weighing on sentiment . A decision by new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to reform financial services regulation reinforced worries about his forthcoming first budget , they said . " He ' s proved that he is a man in a fair hurry , " said one dealer . " People will now be looking for the tax reforms that they were worrying about before the election . " But news of a slowdown in broad money supply growth in April took off the pressure for a near - term British interest rate rise , economists and strategists said . " We ' d have come off the top more if it hadn ' t been for the M4 numbers looking like they ' ve taken the pressure off the Bank of England putting up rates , " said another dealer . M4 grew by 10 . 4 percent in the year to April , well above the three - to - nine percent monitoring range adopted by the previous Conservative government but below the 11 . 3 percent growth economists were forecasting . The Paris market was also firmer following the Fed decision with the CAC 40 index up 47 . 32 points or 1 . 72 percent at 2 , 798 . 43 . But business was thin . " There ' s no volume , " lamented one broker . Germany rose the most of leading European markets on the Fed news . The DAX index was up 49 . 53 points or 1 . 40 percent at 3 , 592 . 96 despite the overnight tumble for the dollar , which lost nearly three pfennigs against the mark . A stronger mark adds to the problems German exporters face . The dollar was stable by midday after the overnight drop which followed the FOMC announcement , although it was slightly easier than morning levels . It also suffered after a senior Bank of Japan official was quoted as saying that the central bank was considering the timing of a decision on raising Japanese interest rates . But later the BOJ said the official had been misquoted and tried to soothe markets by saying there were no immediate plans for a rate rise . The dollar was at 113 . 85 yen at midday compared with 113 . 80 at the European close on Tuesday . It fell below 113 in late U . S . trading on Tuesday . It was at 1 . 6861 marks after closing in Europe on Tuesday at 1 . 6953 and hitting a low later of just above 1 . 67 . Bundesbank council member Hans - Juergen Koebnick said he had little objection to dollar / mark around 1 . 70 but there was no need to expect further weakness of the mark against the dollar . The comments had little effect . " What he said was a bit mixed so the market is a bit confused and taking it marginally negatively , " said Lee Ferridge , currency strategist at Commerzbank in London . Generally foreign exchange trading was slow before U . S . March trade data due at 1230 GMT on Wednesday . An average of analysts ' forecasts pointed to a $ 10 . 3 billion deficit , little changed from February ' s $ 10 . 4 billion shortfall . On precious metals , palladium was fixed at $ 180 . 50 an ounce , the highest level since April 1989 and up $ 0 . 75 from Tuesday afternoon .

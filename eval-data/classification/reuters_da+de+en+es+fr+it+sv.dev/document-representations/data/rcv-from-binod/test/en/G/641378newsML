U . S . sergeant cleared of rape in Germany . A U . S . military jury in Germany on Thursday acquitted an army sergeant of rape and sodomy charges but found him guilty of lesser offences in the latest sex scandal to taint the American armed forces . Sergeant First Class Julius Davis , 37 , of Fayetteville , North Carolina , was found guilty on 11 of 32 counts . The five - member all - male military panel will now decide on punishment for Davis , who Judge Gary Jewell said could face up to 32 years in prison and a dishonorable discharge . The convictions were generally for lesser charges than sought by military prosecutors and focused on allegations of indecent assault and obstruction of justice . Davis is the first soldier to be convicted outside the United States as part of the army ' s probe of abuse allegations at bases around the world that started after charges of rape and harassment surfaced last year at a U . S . base in Germany . He was one of three sergeants accused of sex - related crimes at the Darmstadt base . Defence attorneys had attacked the credibility of the 15 women soldiers who made allegations against Davis , saying there was no medical evidence to support the six counts of rape filed against him and that prosecutors launched a " witchhunt " .

Mexico Cetes rate closes flat after liquid session . Mexico ' s overnight Cetes rate closed unchanged at 24 . 50 percent on Monday after zigzagging during a heavily liquid session and more vigorous dealing than in many recent sessions , traders said . " We saw heavier activity combined with a market that has been awash with liquidity since last week , " a dealer said . Dealers said trading volume increased as local and foreign traders stepped into the market ahead of an expected drop in primary rates . Overnight rates on bank paper paralleled government rates , closing unchanged at 25 . 50 percent . Dealers said they expected primary rates on bellwether 28 - day Cetes to fall by 50 to 75 basis points at Tuesday ' s auction , given lower secondary rates and a firm peso . Banco de Mexico assigned 28 - day Cetes at 25 . 71 percent at last week ' s primary auction . Traders said that primary rates could fall further , to 23 percent , but only after the market had absorbed the effects of an inflationary spike in December and January . " Although rates are tending to fall , they could be reined in while the market awaits December inflation figures , " one dealer said . Banco de Mexico is due to publish inflation figures for December on Thursday . Many brokerages have increased prior estimates for inflation , traditionally high in December , in the wake of price hikes . The central bank offset liquidity shortages by auctioning one overnight credit for 4 . 461 billion pesos , which it assigned at 25 . 48 percent . Total credit maturities forecast for Tuesday were 4 . 464 billion pesos . ( ( - - Patricia Lezama , Mexico City newsroom + 525 728 - 9554 ) )

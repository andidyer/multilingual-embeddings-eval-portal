Vietnam , China rubber prices seen steady . Vietnamese rubber prices were seen steady on Wednesday on the back of good demand from China , but some traders said risks of trading with the country ' s northern neighbour were making other markets look attractive . High grade SVR L rubber was quoted at around $ 1 , 320 a tonne , unchanged over the past week . " It ' s been holding at these levels because Chinese demand is good . I think China will still buy several hundred tonnes this month , " one trader said . Dealers in Singapore said one reason behind the demand was a discount of around 17 Malaysian cents on the rubber from Vietnam compared with the same kind of rubber from Malaysia which was being quoted at 343 cents per kilo . A similar picture was confirmed by officials at state - owned Vietnam General Rubber Company ( Geruco ) , but for the semi - official trade which accounts for around 50 percent of known exports , the situation was less clear . Local dealers said exporting to China entailed risks of defaults and other problems making buyers in Europe or Taiwan Chinese rubber prices were similarly seen steady , but traders said they could rise in the short term despite relatively large stocks in the main producing province of Hainan . Prices of physical rubber were quoted at around 13 , 300 yuan a tonne , including value - added tax , in southern Hainan as offered by the Hainan Nongken Group , a company official said . The group is the biggest rubber producer and supplier in Hainan and effectively controls the market . One factor affecting prices was that output was expected to drop by 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 tonnes compared with 1995 following damage by a typhoon this month , another company official said . Last year , output was 200 , 000 tonnes , accounting for 65 percent of total domestic production , he said . The price on the Hainan physical rubber exchange centre was quoted at 12 , 950 yuan , excluding value - added tax . A local futures trader estimated physical rubber stock in Hainan at about 60 , 000 tonnes , and said this could put heavy pressure on both physical and futures markets .

Belgian analysts welcome scrapping of stocks tax . Analysts on Wednesday welcomed the Belgian government ' s 1997 budget decision to scrap the annual tax of 0 . 042 percent on listed stocks , a levy it said hampered liquidity on the Brussels bourse . " This can be an additional element to attract companies to the stock exchange . It is needed , because over the last 20 to 30 years we have seen a drop in the number of Belgian companies quoted on the exchange , " said Michel Ernst at KB - Securities . In its budget statement on Tuesday the government said the tax differentiated between quoted and non - quoted companies , and also between the Belgian and foreign bourses . It said the annual tax encouraged companies already listed to reduce the amount of their capital quoted on the bourse . The measure will have a negative impact on the budget of 600 million francs . Another analyst , who asked not to be named , said for the medium term the tax reduction could encourage companies to stay with the Brussels bourse once the planned single European currency was introduced . " When everything is in Euros , it would make no sense for them to stay on the Brussels bourse , so this could encourage companies not to take away their listing , " he said . Analysts said however a separate budget decision to impose a tax of 0 . 002 percent on the delivery of bearer certificates to the investor would have little discernable impact on the market . The government said this measure was aimed at boosting transactions with dematerialised certificates . " This means a change for private investors , but there numbers are small compared to institutionals , " one said . " The fact that they have installed it at all is interesting though as it gives them the opportunity to raise the tax in the future , " another added . The government said this measure would raise four billion francs . - - Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6810 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

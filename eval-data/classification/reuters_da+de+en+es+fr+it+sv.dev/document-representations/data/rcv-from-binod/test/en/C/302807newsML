RTRS - RESEARCH ALERT - QBE rated a ' buy ' . Morgan Stockbroking Ltd said it recommended major insurer QBE Insurance Group Ltd as a buy , based on a currently underperforming share price and improved fundamentals . " Recommendation is buy . Fundamentals have improved such that the premium it ( the company ) usually trades on compared with other listed insurance companies has narrowed , " analyst Nicole Ferro said in a report . Key factors driving QBE ' s profit growth over the medium term were strong international insurance operations , a solid outlook for the investment portfolio and an ongoing objective to reduce costs , Ferro said . " QBE ' s share price has underperformed since its bonus issue in October , 1966 , " Ferro said . QBE shares closed two cents lower at A $ 6 . 44 on Monday , compared with a 12 - month high of A $ 7 . 13 . The company was forecasting double digit growth from all divisions in the current year with Morgan forecasting a group net profit of A $ 149 . 1 million in the year ended June 30 , 1997 , compared with a reported $ 147 . 3 million in 1995 / 96 . The forecast current - year profit translated into expected earnings per share of 51 . 8 cents against 52 . 8 cents last year . " With a payout ratio around 50 percent , the company is expected to pay dividends totalling 27 cents per share ( 26 cents last year ) , partially franked , " Ferro said . With offices in Australia and 20 other countries , QBE ' s core strengths were a geographic spread of businesses and a diversified products mix , Ferro said . " Over the past 10 years , QBE has reported impressive rates of growth , averaging 22 percent per annnum compound as measured by adjusted earnings per share , " Ferro said . In a lower inflation , more competitive business environment and on a larger capital base , the company might find it difficult to meet these levels of past performance in the future , she said . " Nonetheless , strong management of both claims and expenses , backed up by a highly profitable and expanding international book will provide the impetus for future profit growth , " Ferro said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

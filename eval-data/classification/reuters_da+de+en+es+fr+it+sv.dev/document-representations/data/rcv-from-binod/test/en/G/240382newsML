Sri Lanka pardons pair in murder , rape case . Sri Lanka pardoned two soldiers involved in the rape and murder of a minority Tamil girl in exchange for testimony against nine other accused security personnel , Justice Minister G . L . Peiris said on Friday . Peiris said the action showed the government ' s determination to stamp out human rights violations by its security forces . The men were charged in the September 7 rape and murder of a 17 - year - old girl who was on her way home from school in northern Jaffna town . Her mother , 16 - year - old brother and a neighbour who went looking for the girl also were killed . Peiris told reporters the two soldiers , who were not involved in the rape and murders but allegedly helped dispose of the bodies , had been offered conditional pardons in return for testifying against seven soldiers and two policemen accused of the crimes . " A conditional pardon has been offered to two accused in order to buttress the case for the prosecution , " he said . The government has pledged to improve the tarnished human rights record of its security forces , which are involved in fighting a separatist rebellion by Tamil rebels in the north . " We have brought this case before the court - - justice will be done , " Peiris said . " It does not matter who is responsible - - army , police ; however high , however low , there ' s nobody who enjoys immunity from the law . " The court case against the nine remaining defendants is due to resume in Colombo early next year . President Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected two years ago on a platform of peace with the separatist rebels and an end to human rights abuses . Human rights groups have accused government forces of sweeping abuses , including executions , torture and disappearances . The government is investigating allegations of abuses , but denies that violations are still widespread . Peiris said Sri Lankans expect a sincere commitment to human rights from the ruling People ' s Alliance . " This is a fragile situation , it has to be constantly monitored and the government has to do everything in its power to see that fundamental rights are observed in practice , " he said . The government says more than 50 , 000 people have died in the 13 - year Tamil rebellion . The rebels say the death toll is much higher .

FORECAST - Scottish Hydro looks to future . Vertically - integrated electricity company Scottish Hydro - Electric should see half year profits up 10 percent or so on December 12 and raise its dividend , but analysts will want details on future strategy . " The big story really is what Scottish Hydro will do with its money , " said one analyst who asked not to be identified . The company has around 500 million stg to spend , analysts said , and could choose investments , shareholder benefits or a mixture of the two . Pre - tax profits for the six months are expected to come in between 63 and 70 . 7 million stg compared with 61 . 7 million stg a year ago while the dividend should be around 5 . 2 pence , up from 4 . 75 pence previously . " The vision thing , that is what the market will look for , " said the analyst . Scottish Hydro saw the supply business of British Gas in Scotland and northern England slip through its hands when talks between the two companies broke down in September . But analysts said these might not be ruled out as British Gas moves towards demerging its supply business . Scottish Hydro has ruled out buying a regional electricity company ( Rec ) or water and sewerage company and analysts said it was likely to focus on investment in generating assets . It has discussed taking full control of the Keadby power station near Scunthorpe , north east England , which it currently owns in a 50 : 50 joint venture with United Utilities . Analysts said the company might invest more in independent power projects and combined heat and power ( CHP ) schemes as a means of increasing its presence in generation . At the same time , it might decide to return some cash to shareholders through special dividends or a buyback , they said . " But it might want to hang on to some funds in case those British Gas talks light up again , " the analyst said . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

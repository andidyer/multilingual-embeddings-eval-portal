U . S . Spring / White Wheat - Bids up , demand increases . Spring wheat bids were higher on Thursday as MGE futures rose and spot demand increased , several U . S . cash grain merchants said . " It seems like the basis firmed up a little bit , " a Minnesota dealer said . " People are short and needing to buy some wheat before the lakes close up . " He said the Great Lakes shipping channels normally close in mid - to late December but the exact date depends on weather conditions . An early freeze would close the channels sooner . Farmer selling remained slow in most areas as farmers held out for higher prices . Many farmers opted to put new crop supplies under USDA loan for an average price of $ 2 . 25 to $ 2 . 50 per bushel . If prices go up by the time the loans are due , farmers would repay the money and sell the wheat at a profit , dealers explained . If prices fall , farmers can default on the loan and give up the grain to the Commodity Credit Corp . " They ' re willing to do just about anything to keep that grain out of market , " a Montana dealer said .

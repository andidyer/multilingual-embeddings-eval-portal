Solana rules out NATO intervention in Albania . NATO Secretary - General Javier Solana , stressing the alliance was not a world policeman , on Tuesday ruled out military intervention in Albania and said diplomacy was the key to solving the crisis . " In Albania at this moment , politics has to be done , diplomacy has to be done . It ' s not for any military operation by NATO or by anybody else , " Solana told reporters . " It is probably true after Bosnia the expectation has been created that NATO controls just about everything . Of course , NATO cannot be transformed into a world police , " Solana said . " There has to be something diplomatic . In fact it has been done last night and this morning . There have been some decisions and some meetings at EU level and some other institutions , " the alliance chief told reporters , without giving details . Solana , who then held talks with British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo , said the prime aim of the 16 - member alliance was to guarantee the security of its own members . Albania is not a full member of NATO . After meeting Solana , Portillo stressed : " What we have in Albania is a political problem . " It really is jumping a lot of hurdles to start asking about NATO . What we need is a political approach to a political problem . " He said that was best pursued through the European Union , possibly the United Nations and under Albania ' s obligations in the OSCE . The country is under a state of emergency after riots by people enraged by the collapse of risky investment funds .

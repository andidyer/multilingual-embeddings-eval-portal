Ringgit weakens against dollar , but stays in range . The ringgit stayed weak against the dollar in Asian trading but was kept within a tight range as fears of fresh central bank intervention capped the dollar ' s rise , dealers said . They said Bank Negara intervened on Friday to sell around $ 100 million to support the ringgit at 2 . 5250 a dollar after a heavy attack on the local currency . No confirmation was available from Bank Negara , which does not comment on its open market intervention . " The market looks set to test 2 . 5250 again , maybe to see how serious Bank Negara is , " said a dealer with a European bank in Kuala Lumpur . " I think Bank Negara was there merely to limit the dollar ' s rise rather than reversing its trend . " Dealers said there was no evidence of the central bank ' s presence in the open market on Monday . Month - end requirements and offshore demand supported the dollar although its upside was curbed by talk of Bank Negara placing orders to sell at 2 . 5250 , dealers said . At 1000 GMT , the ringgit was at 2 . 5245 / 55 to a dollar . It closed at 2 . 5228 / 35 in Kuala Lumpur on Friday . - - Syed Azman ( 603 - 206 2323 )

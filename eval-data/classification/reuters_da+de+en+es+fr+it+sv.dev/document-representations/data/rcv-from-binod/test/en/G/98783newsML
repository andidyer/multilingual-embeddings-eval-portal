Austrian right and left lock horns ahead of polls . Austrian voters , smarting from welfare cuts , job losses and tax rises , look set to vent their frustration on Chancellor Franz Vranitzky ' s Social Democrats in European parliamentary and Vienna state elections next Sunday . The far right is likely to pick up many of the protest votes to nudge it towards the 25 percent mark Joerg Haider has aimed for since he became Freedom Party chief in 1986 . Austria votes for the first time in elections for the European Union ' s parliament on October 13 , to elect 21 candidates to the Strasbourg - based legislature . A Vienna state poll on the same day looks certain to end half a century of Social Democrat rule in the capital . Vranitzky has focused his campaign on jobs , but with Haider clearly a serious challenger in the capital , the chancellor has warned voters to spurn the far right " fringe " and uttered the " F " - word most Austrians would prefer to forget - - fascism . " Let us be responsible about the far - right fringe . We must never again let fascism have a future in our country , " Vranitzky said at a rally in the industrial city of Linz . Fascists seized control of Austria in 1934 , four years before Adolf Hitler annexed the state into the Third Reich . Haider has taken up the employment theme , ridiculing government promises that EU membership would mean more jobs . " Jobs have gone in the textile industry and the food industry thanks to the EU . The government promised that membership would create 38 , 000 new jobs but in fact we have lost 40 , 000 , " Haider told working class supporters in Vienna . While the Social Democrats and their coalition partner , the People ' s Party , trumpet the value of European economic union and a single currency , Haider warns it will mean a dilution of the stable schilling by weaker southern European currencies . Haider also called for an end to an influx of foreigners , a popular idea among some Austrians worried about rising unemployment and a perceived increase in crime . The Euro - poll is the first nationwide test of Vranitzky ' s government since a snap general election last December and the introduction in March of a tough two - year austerity budget . Economic belt - tightening has coincided with growing discontent in Austria over the EU . A survey in June showed 57 percent of people felt EU membership had a negative effect on their lives . Most industrialists back the government ' s aim to be among the hard core of EU members ready for economic union and a single currency by 1999 but bankruptcies , insolvencies , takeovers and job losses have been on the rise since EU entry . In the first nine months of this year , 1 , 656 companies filed for insolvency - - the highest rate since 1945 . The huge supermarket chain Billa and big - name ski makers Blizzard and Atomic have been snapped up by foreign buyers , prompting many voters to blame the EU rather than out - dated management practices or high production costs . In the race for Vienna , the Social Democrats look set to lose control of the city they have ruled since 1945 . " Emotions are running high over the number of foreigners in Vienna because people believe they take away jobs , " said Werner Beutelmeyer of Linz - based research institute Market . The far right ousted the conservatives into second place in the last elections in 1991 and are poised to win more votes .

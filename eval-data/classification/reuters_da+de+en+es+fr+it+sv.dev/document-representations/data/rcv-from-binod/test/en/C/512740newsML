Canadian Senate passes anti - tobacco bill . The Canadian Senate on Wednesday passed an anti - tobacco bill that the federal government had been trying to rush through Parliament before a general election expected to be called in the next few weeks . Parliament ' s elected chamber , the House of Commons , had already passed the bill in March , and the Senate vote assured that the legislation will become law . The bill now only requires royal assent , which is routinely granted . The bill will restrict advertising and tobacco company sponsorship of sporting and cultural events . If the Senate had failed to pass the bill before federal elections were called , the legislation would have died . Introduced in response to a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that struck down a ban on tobacco ads , the bill will seek to restrict tobacco advertising and ban vending machine sales of tobacco . Both Liberal and Conservative senators were eager to pass the bill ahead of an expected election call , despite concerns from Quebec legislators over what the restrictions might do to popular sponsored events . Imperial Tobacco Ltd , a unit of Imasco Ltd controls about 65 percent of the Canadian cigarette market . Imasco is 40 percent owned by B . A . T . Industries Plc of Britain . The second biggest player , Rothmans , Benson and Hedges Inc , is owned 60 percent by Rothmans Inc and 40 percent by Philip Morris Cos Inc . Rothmans Inc is a unit of Rothmans International Plc , which is owned by Swiss luxury goods holding company Cie Financiere Richmont AG . Third place holder RJR MacDonald is wholly owned by R . J . Reynolds Tobacco International , a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp . ( ( Randall Palmer , Reuters Ottawa Bureau 613 - 235 - 6745 ) )

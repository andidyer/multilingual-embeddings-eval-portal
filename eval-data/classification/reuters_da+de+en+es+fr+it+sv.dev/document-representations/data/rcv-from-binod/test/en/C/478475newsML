CWB sees Pacific demurrage bill above $ 20 million . The Canadian Wheat Board ' s demurrage bill for ships waiting to load grain at Pacific ports has probably exceeded C $ 20 million since January , a CWB spokeswoman said . " We ' re probably looking upwards of C $ 20 million , " CWB spokeswoman Deanna Allen told Reuters . Heavy snow , extreme cold and equipment failure caused a backlog in railcar grain deliveries to Pacific ports from the Prairies since early January . The port backlog reached its peak early last month when one ship was berthed as long as 62 days in Vancouver . At that time , the CWB said its demurrage bill exceeded C $ 15 million and it had to shift 1 . 5 million tonnes of grain exports into the next crop year , beginning August 1 . The CWB acknowledged it had to defer February and March shipments of grain , but the board and Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale have said repeatedly that the CWB did not lose sales . One vessel had been waiting for 49 days to load at a Pacific port on Thursday , the last day for which figures are available . ( ( Gilbert Le Gras 204 947 3548 ) )

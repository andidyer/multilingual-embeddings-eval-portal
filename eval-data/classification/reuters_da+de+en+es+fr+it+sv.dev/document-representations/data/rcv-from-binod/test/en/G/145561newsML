SOCCER - NEW FOREIGN SAINTS SEND UNITED CRASHING TO ANOTHER DEFEAT . While Chelsea ' s tears flowed for benefactor Matthew Harding and Arsenal extended the hand of friendship to George Graham , Southampton outshone everyone on the pitch on Saturday by scoring six goals against Manchester United . A hat - trick from Norwegian Egil Ostenstadt , two from Israeli Eyal Berkovic and a chip from Matt Le Tissier gave Southampton a memorable 6 - 3 win over the champions who have now conceded 11 goals in their last two league matches following their 5 - 0 defeat at Newcastle last week . United ' s miserable trip to The Dell , where they were beaten 3 - 1 last season wearing their dismal grey shirts , was compounded by Roy Keane ' s dismissal after only 22 minutes . United ' s 10 - men battled gamely after he went following two illegal challenges , but Southampton , boosted by manager Graeme Souness ' s astute new overseas signings , are no longer the sort of team to whom opponents can donate a two - goal start and a one - man advantage . Berkovic , signed for 1 . 2 million pounds ( $ 1 . 92 million ) from Maccabi Haifa , two weeks ago , opened the scoring after six minutes , slamming home a rebound after Peter Schmeichel could not hold a drive from Ostenstadt . Le Tissier made it 2 - 0 after 35 minutes with a brilliant sidestep and a chip similar to the one Newcastle ' s Philip Albert lofted over Schmeichel last week . A superbly - struck David Beckham free - kick put United back in the match after 41 minutes but on the stroke of half - time Ostenstadt made it 3 - 1 . David May headed United ' s second after 56 minutes , before Berkovic made it 4 - 2 with a stunning volley with only seven minutes to go . There were still three more goals still to come in the last few minutes . Ostenstadt , signed for 900 , 000 pounds ( $ 1 . 44 million ) from Viking Stavanger at the same time as Berkovic , made it 5 - 2 five minutes from time , Paul Scholes made it 5 - 3 with two minutes to go before Ostenstadt claimed the match ball as his own , completing his hat - trick with seconds remaining . " My best friend in Norway is Manchester United - mad , " he joked afterwards , " I am going to go and ring him right away . " It must have been a great match to watch , " he added . " Scoring the first just before half - time helped my self - confidence . " Berkovic , 24 , was the architect of Southampton ' s victory and was outstanding throughout , his range of tricks and flicks continually undermining the United defence . He earned glowing praise from manager Graeme Souness who first saw him playing as a 17 - year - old and had never forgotten his silky skills . " He is a very special player , " Souness said , " He sees things differently to other players , he sees a different picture . " But he was quick not to write off United ' s title chances . " Only a fool would say United are anything but a very good side , even though they ' ve conceded 11 goals in a week . There ' s not a lot wrong with them , and they ' ll still be there or thereabouts at the end of the season . " Along with Souness ' s other recent foreign import , Dutchman Ulrich van Gobbel , signed from the manager ' s old club Galatasaray of Turkey , Southampton have been transformed from the side that went seven league matches without a win at the start of the season . They have now won three and drawn one of their last four , and are quickly moving up the table . United are still favourites to win the title , but although manager Alex Ferguson looked stunned at the six goals conceded this week after the five his side leaked last Sunday , he seemed remarkably upbeat afterwards . " What can you say after that ? " he asked . " It was just like the old days , the sort of scoreline you don ' t get any more . Everything they hit seemed to go in , but I thought it was a marvellous performance from us in the second half . " Jordi Cruyff missed a great chance and if that had gone in who knows what would have happened ? " The last time Southampton scored six in a league match was when they beat Luton 6 - 3 in November 1989 . United had not conceded six since they lost 6 - 0 at Ipswich in March 1980 . It was also a day of unfamiliar emotions at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea and Spurs fans stood in silent tribute to Harding , the 42 - year - old Chelsea vice - chairman killed in a helicopter crash on Tuesday . Across London at Highbury , Arsenal fans welcomed back Graham , their former manager dismissed for his part in shady transfer deals , with his Leeds team . Both Chelsea and Arsenal duly won on Saturday , a rare day when many fans temporarily put aside old rivalries and let their true feelings show .

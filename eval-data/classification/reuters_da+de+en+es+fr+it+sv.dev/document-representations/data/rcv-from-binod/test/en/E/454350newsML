ETLA sees Bank of Finland key rate hike in 1998 . The Bank of Finland is likely to tighten monetary policy in 1998 following the lead of other European Union countries , the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy ( ETLA ) said in its 1997 / 1 economic forecast . " This year a loose monetary policy is . . . justified by the tight fiscal policy of the EU countries , " ETLA said , referring to efforts to reach the public sector deficit criterion for the third stage of European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) . " Next year the Bank of Finland is anticipated to raise short - term interest rates in the wake of other EU countries as inflation picks up slightly , " ETLA said . Finnish inflation would accelerate , but only slightly , this year and next , it said . " Consumer prices will rise by one percent in Finland this year . Underlying inflation will remain lower than this . There is little reason to expect a rise in interest rates this year stemming from domestic reasons , " ETLA said . " There is no need to tighten monetary policy significantly even next year if wage settlements remain modest , " it added . In 1998 , short - term interest rates would edge higher in EU countries due to " the strengthening of economic growth and slightly increasing inflationary pressures , " ETLA said . " Efforts to meet the EMU criteria will nevertheless curb growth in continental Europe , " it said . " Fulfilling the EMU criteria for public finances will require tight fiscal policies in those countries seeking to join EMU right from the beginning of 1999 and where there is still a need to reduce public sector deficits and debt , " it said . At the moment , European growth was still slow and " there is no fear of overheating , " it added . In the United States , the Federal Reserve was expected to raise interest rates this year , ETLA said . - - Helsinki newsroom + 358 - 9 - 680 50 245 , e - mail news @ reuters . fi

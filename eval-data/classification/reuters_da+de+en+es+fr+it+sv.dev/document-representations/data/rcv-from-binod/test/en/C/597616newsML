Cable and Wireless buys 49 pct Panama ' s INTEL . Britain ' s Cable and Wireless won an auction Tuesday for a 49 percent stake in Panama ' s national telephone company INTEL with a bid of $ 652 million , Finance Minister Miguel Heras said . " Cable and Wireless exceeds the reference price , we will now proceed to signing the contract , " Heras said after Cable and Wireless beat GTE Corp in an auction for INTEL . GTE offered $ 452 million , below the government ' s base price of $ 500 million . No other companies had registered to bid in the auction . " It ' s a tremendously synergetic move for us , " Geoff Wiggin , managing director of Cable and Wireless West Indies , told reporters . Cable and Wireless represents 22 businesses in the Caribbean region , he said . " It was an excellent offer , well above what the government expected , " said Alfredo Macia , head of Panama ' s privatization program . Cable and Wireless ' concession to manage INTEL lasts 20 years . Government officials have said they expect the new operator of INTEL to invest at least $ 500 million in expanding and upgrading Panama ' s telephone system over the next five years . Line density is expected to increase from 12 . 2 per 100 inhabitants to about 25 per 100 inhabitants . The concession also requires Cable and Wireless to set up a Band B cellular service within 12 months . A consortium led by BellSouth Corp won the license to set up and operate Panama ' s first cellular network , Band A , with a $ 72 . 6 million bid last year .

Rwanda says any force for Zaire must be neutral . Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said on Friday that any international force deployed to help refugees in east Zaire would have to be part of a mixed force with African troops , and must above all be neutral . Earlier this week Gasana said in Brussels that Rwanda would strongly oppose any international military intervention in eastern Zaire . In Bonn he said European troops would be accepted as part of a mixed force . " All humanitarian help will be welcome , whether it is from an African intervention force which is strictly humanitarian or even a mixed European and African force , but only a neutral one . We insist on the neutrality of this force , " Gasana told reporters after meeting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel . Gasana said he wanted to rule out the risk of a repeat of " Operation Turquoise " - - the French military intervention in Rwanda in the wake of the 1994 genocide when Gasana said the French deported thousands of Rwandans to Zaire . Rwandan support for a protection force is vital as the easiest supply routes pass through its territory , and the rebels who have seized a chunk of eastern Zaire are allies of Rwanda . Around a million Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees are threatened by fighting in eastern Zaire , where 1 , 000 hungry people tried to storm a United Nations warehouse in the eastern city of Goma on Friday to seize the last scraps of food . Kinkel ruled out sending German troops as part of an international force , but he renewed appeals to the international community to do its utmost to help refugees . " A military solution must not at any price be used to resolve the difficult situation in the region . A political solution must be found , " he said . " German participation ( in any international force ) is not possible . " Gasana said the most important aim for his government was to see the safe return of Rwandan refugees from camps in Zaire . " All the refugees must return . We continue to make appeals for the repatriation of the refugees . " He said they were being held hostage in Zaire as prisoners of the Zairean government and military and of the RPR ( the former Rwandan army ) . As yet corridors to help the refugees return to Rwanda have not been established , and Kinkel told Gasana that Rwanda had a responsibility to make this happen . " Rwanda has a very , very important responsibility in the region and must recognise and assume this responsibility . " He said Rwanda must make its own airports available to aid flights and do everything in its power to persuade Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire to open the airports in Goma and Bukavu for humanitarian relief . " Our airport at Kigali is available to the international community for humanitarian assistance , " Gasana replied . Aid workers say many refugees are afraid to return for fear of revenge for the slaughter in 1994 of up to a million Tutsis and their Hutu allies by Hutus .

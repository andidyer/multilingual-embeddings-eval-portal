Stricken European oil refining still in the red . Two years of restructuring and plant closure in Europe ' s oil refining industry has done little to improve margins which are still not covering costs , oil industry executives said on Thursday . " I don ' t think we are are seeing any impact coming through from the recent closures in Europe even if margins are slightly better now . . . They are still not covering costs , " said Michel Bernard , a trading manager at Shell U . K . , a unit of Royal Dutch / Shell Group . Refining margins - - the difference in price between crude oil and refined products - - hit a low of $ 1 . 00 per barrel in July and August before recovering to $ 1 . 50 - $ 2 . 00 in September , still below the $ 2 . 00 a barrel cost of running a typical European refinery , Bernard said . " European margins are the best in the world at the moment , but even so they are not rocketing , " said an analyst at another major European oil company . " The third quarter this year looks about the same as the third quarter last year , and last year was awful , " he added . In 1995 , margins hit their lowest level in a quarter of a century , causing major corporate restructuring and some plant closures across the Western hemisphere . France ' s Total SA said in June that Europe still had 15 percent excess capacity and repeated its call for industry - wide action to combat weak margins . Bernard said the recent recovery in margins was more a result of market fears of stock shortages in the U . S . and Europe than of industry measures , but he was encouraged by the rising trend . " A lot of products are looking very supportive , " he said . " It ' s not often that products follow crude prices when crude prices are high , but over the last 10 days we have seen a parallel line between products and crude . " He said European heating oil , naphtha and fuel oil prices were all strong relative to Brent crude , which hit its highest level since the Gulf War on Thursday . Analysts say European moves to cut overcapacity have been somewhat negated by a huge expansion in East Asia . So far this year , South Korea and Thailand have added 475 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of new capacity , while Europe has cut about 250 , 000 bpd in the last two years and plans another 60 , 000 bpd closure next year . " If you look at last year , the Far East was a net importer of gasoline , but in the last two or three months it has been the other way round . I see that as a structural change in the market , " Bernard said . Low stocks remain one potential bullish factor for margins this winter , analysts said , while another was the switch to very low sulphur diesel in Europe in October . Traders say some countries , such as Portugal and Greece , are not yet able to cover their demand for the new fuel . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8145

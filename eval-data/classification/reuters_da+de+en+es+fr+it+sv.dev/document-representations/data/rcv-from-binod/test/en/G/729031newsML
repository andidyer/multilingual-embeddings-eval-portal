Israel ' s Netanyahu slams U . N . settlement debate . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a swipe at the United Nations on Tuesday over a General Assembly resolution requesting its members halt support for Jewish settlements . " While thousands or hundreds of thousands are dying in various wars or disasters in the world . . . the United Nations chooses to discuss two or three bulldozers that are building apartments for tranquil citizens in Jerusalem , " Netanyahu told reporters . " That ' s what the United Nations has to do ? Apparently so , " he said . The proposal , expected to be adopted later on Tuesday , asks countries to prevent individuals or companies from supporting settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to bar the import of goods produced there . It follows up a recent report by Secretary - General Kofi Annan condemning Israel for not abandoning settlement construction at a site in Arab East Jerusalem called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic . In a speech in Jerusalem on Tuesday , Egypt ' s ambassador to Israel Mohammad Bassiouny , dismissed criticism of the U . N . stand on settlements . " When all the world is against you , you don ' t see something is wrong ? " he said . " You can ' t make peace at the same time you make settlements . " The Assembly demanded at an emergency special session in April that Israel halt work at the Jerusalem site where bulldozers are carving the infrastructure for 6 , 500 homes . Its resolutions are non - binding . The start of construction last March plunged Israel - PLO peacemaking into crisis and triggered waves of Arab unrest in the West Bank and Gaza . Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it , viewing all of the Jerusalem as its capital . Palestinians want East Jerusalem for the capital of their future state and view the Israeli construction as a bid to pre - empt future peace talks on the city ' s fate . The Assembly resolution , sponsored by 15 Arab and Moslem nations , would also condemn Israel ' s " lack of cooperation " with the intended dispatch by Annan of a U . N . mission to the area . Last week , Bassiouny and U . S . ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk hosted a meeting between Israeli defence chief Yitzhak Mordechai and Palestinian cabinet minister Nabil Shaath on ways to resume formal peace talks halted by the settlement building . " They ( Mordechai and Shaath ) are trying to find ways to rebuild confidence by implementing the remaining issues in the Oslo process , " Bassiouny said . He was referring to discussions on opening Palestinian air and sea ports in Gaza and a " safe passage " corridor between the strip and West Bank as agreed in Israel - PLO interim peace deals signed since 1993 .

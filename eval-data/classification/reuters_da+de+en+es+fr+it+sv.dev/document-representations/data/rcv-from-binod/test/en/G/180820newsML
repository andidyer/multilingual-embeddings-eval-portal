Tourist industry launches new all - Ireland brand . The Irish tourist industry on Monday launched a new all - Ireland tourism brand to promote the island , both north and south , as a holiday destination into the next millennium . A 30 million punt ( $ 49 . 53 million ) advertising and marketing campaign will update Ireland ' s image overseas and focus on strengths such as its people , its warm welcome , its green environment and activities such as golf and horse - riding which can be enjoyed by visitors . Named Tourism Brand Ireland , the new strategy was developed by the Irish tourist board , Bord Failte , the Northern Irish Tourist Board and the tourist industry and is the first to promote the island as one entity . Speaking at the launch , Irish tourism minister Enda Kenny said the island of Ireland had everything to gain from promoting itself as a collective entity in brand marketing terms around the world . " I believe that Tourism Brand Ireland has the potential to make an enormous contribution to the ongoing search for a lasting peace on this island of ours . " Northern Ireland economy minister Baroness Denton said the benefits to the British - ruled province would be considerable . " We estimate the potential additional revenue in the region of 27 million pounds ( $ 44 . 50 million ) in the next three years alone . The expenditure could generate an additional 720 jobs sustained by visitor spend , " she said . Despite reports to the contrary , the new marketing campaign retains Ireland ' s traditional symbol , the shamrock , in a new logo which depicts two people embracing and exchanging the three - leafed plant . " We are not discarding the things we hold dear or the things which have made this country ' s tourism industry such a resounding economic success , " Bord Failte chairman Padraig O ' hUiginn said . " We are merely placing those strengths on a more solid footing to meet the challenges which lie ahead . " Tourism in Ireland has been hugely successful with total visitor numbers outstripping the number of inhabitants on the island in recent years . It is also a vital part of the Irish economy , providing 2 . 3 billion punts ( $ 3 . 80 billion ) in earnings and accounting for 102 , 000 full - time jobs in 1995 .

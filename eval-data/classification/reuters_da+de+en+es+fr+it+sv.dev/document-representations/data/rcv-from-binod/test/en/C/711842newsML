Asian Props says to proceed with EGM . Asian Properties Ltd said on Monday the sale of its interests in Malaysia ' s President Hotel Sdn Bhd was not completed on Friday . The sale of its one third interest for NZ $ 56 . 7 million was announced in October . When the board announced a capital reduction last month the company said the reduction could not realistically proceed without completion of the sale of the President Hotel . The company said it now appeared that the proceeds of the sale would not be received before the shareholders ' meeting on Thursday . Since the board ' s initial announcement Asian Properties has received its share of the purchaser ' s deposit and Asian Properties ' chairman has reaffirmed his commitment to withdraw from participation in the reduction . In an effort to preserve the proposal ( and the benefits to shareholders ) , the board said it had urgently reviewed funding requirements for the reduction . " The board is confident that the company could now undertake the reduction without the President Hotel sale proceeds . " Accordingly the EGM of shareholders will still be held on July 10 and shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the proposed reduction and the delisting of the company .

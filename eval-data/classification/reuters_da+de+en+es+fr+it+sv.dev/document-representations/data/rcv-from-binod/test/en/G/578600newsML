Witnesses in Pointe Noire said the Outeniqua docked at the harbour there on Tuesday . Spokesman Ricky Naidoo said Mbeki consulted by telephone with representatives of Kabila and Mobutu and with United Nations and Organisation of African Unity envoys .

" Mobutu has to go , to relinquish power to the alliance , that is on Wednesday , the day after tomorrow , " he said . Netshitenzhe said agreement was reached in mid - afternoon on the framework for an accord that could be confirmed on the ship .

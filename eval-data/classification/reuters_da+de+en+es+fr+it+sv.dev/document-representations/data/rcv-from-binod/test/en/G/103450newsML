Saudi interior minister departs Yemen after talks . Saudi Arabia ' s Interior Minister Prince Nayef left Yemen on Tuesday after a second round of talks with President Ali Abdullah Saleh , an official said . On Monday , he met with Saleh and delivered a letter from the Saudi monarch King Fahd . The message dealt with issues of mutual concern and ways of enhancing the " brotherly ties " between the two neighbouring countries , official Yemeni television said . It did not disclose details of the letter ' s contents . Prince Nayef one - day visit was aimed at following up on talks held in August between Saudi Defence Minister Prince Sultan and Yemeni officials , including discussions on their mutual borders . Yemen and Saudi Arabia had several minor clashes in a potentially oil and gas - rich border area before the two sides signed last year a memorandum of understanding to resolve the 60 - year - old border dispute . Prince Sultan ' s landmark visit appeared to put an end to years of tension and mistrust between the neighbours .

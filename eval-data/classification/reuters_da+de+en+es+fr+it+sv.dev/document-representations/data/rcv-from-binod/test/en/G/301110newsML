Argentina said seeking Falklands talks deadline . Argentina ' s Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella has asked British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to set a date for public talks on sovereignty over the disputed Falkland Islands , a Buenos Aires newspaper said on Saturday . " They tried to work on some kind of agenda to . . . set a date in which the sovereignty issue would be discussed , " a government official , who asked not to be identified , told the daily Clarin of the two - day talks in Britain . On Friday , Di Tella , under fire for his policy on the disputed islands that sent the two countries to a brief but bloody war in 1982 , made a surprise visit to Britain to talk with Rifkind at his country residence in Chevening , in southeast England . Although they tried to keep the talks discreet , news of the meeting leaked to the Argentine press . A British Embassy spokesman on Friday described the meeting as informal talks on bilateral ties and stressed : " No change to British sovereignty over the remote Falklands will be discussed . We are not offering or prepared to transfer or share sovereignty . " Argentina lost the war over the South Atlantic islands it calls Malvinas , in which nearly 1 , 000 soldiers , mostly Argentine , died . Both sides have resumed friendly relations , but Buenos Aires has not dropped sovereignty claims . Britain keeps a garrison there and refuses to discuss sovereignty . But since Peronist President Carlos Menem came to power in 1989 , he has resumed diplomatic ties , hosted visits by British royals and forged close trade links , while insisting he will win back the islands by the year 2000 . The two nations agreed in 1990 to set up an " umbrella " under which the sovereignty issue would be put on hold while London and Buenos Aires tried to make headway on other aspects of the conflict . This allowed them to discuss fishing rights and joint oil exploration in disputed South Atlantic waters . But government sources told Clarin that Di Tella had asked Rifkind to put the umbrella aside and set a date for public discussions on sovereignty .

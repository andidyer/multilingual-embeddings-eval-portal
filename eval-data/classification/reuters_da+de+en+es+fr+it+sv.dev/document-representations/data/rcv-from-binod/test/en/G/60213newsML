Friend of U . S . Ag Department exec given book contract . Agriculture Undersecretary Ellen Haas failed to disclose that she was close friends with the author of a book commissioned by one of her agencies , congressional investigators said Wednesday . Haas denied the charge . Investigators from the General Accounting Office said Haas violated ethics regulations by not reporting the relationship to the agency ' s ethics officer . They raised the issue during a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing that faulted several expenditures under Team Nutrition , a project to improve children ' s diets and school meals . On a number of counts , the GAO , the investigatory arm of Congress , said there was poor management or improper changes to the handful of contracts that were reviewed . Haas said she excused herself from any role in awarding the 1994 book grant to author Susan Shreve after making sure the department ' s top ethics officer , J . Michael Kelly , was aware of the relationship . The GAO disputed what Haas ' aides told Kelly and if he was the appropriate person to tell . Kelly has ruled there was no ethics violation because the rules were aimed at family members and business partners .

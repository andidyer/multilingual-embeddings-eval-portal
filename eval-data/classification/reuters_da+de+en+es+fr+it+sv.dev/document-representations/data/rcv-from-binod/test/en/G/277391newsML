Yeltsin warns tax dodgers , vows to help pensioners . President Boris Yeltsin , cracking the whip after his long absence from the Kremlin , vowed to get tough with tax - dodgers on Thursday and promised elderly Russians they would soon receive their unpaid pensions . Yeltsin ' s chief - of - staff , Anatoly Chubais , told a news conference the president had also decided to tighten government controls over the production and sale of alcohol in order to plug a gaping hole in state revenues . " The president characterised the situation regarding delays in payment of pensions as amoral , " Chubais said , adding that Yeltsin felt a personal responsibility to Russia ' s pensioners . Chubais , a liberal formerly in charge of the country ' s privatisation programme , was speaking after Yeltsin chaired a special commission set up to tackle tax evasion and serious arrears in wage and pension payments . The commission agreed that all debts to Russia ' s pensioners - - currently totalling some 16 trillion roubles ( $ 3 billion ) - - should be cleared by July 1 , Chubais said . Yeltsin , who returned to the Kremlin on Monday after completing his convalescence from heart surgery , said delays in the payment of pensions would not be tolerated after February . The president also ordered a thorough overhaul of Russia ' s country ' s creaking pensions system , Chubais said . At its next session in January , also to be chaired by Yeltsin , the tax commission will announce measures against 15 big companies that owe huge sums to the state budget and to the national pension fund . " Needless to say that these firms will face the most severe measures under existing legislation , " the youthful , red - haired Chubais said . He did not name them and gave no further details . Chubais said the government planned to tighten regulation of Russia ' s vodka industry and ensure that producers , traders and importers paid the required taxes and duties . Smugglers , bootleggers and moonshiners are estimated to be cheating the state of about two trillion roubles ( $ 350 million ) a month . However Chubais made clear Russia was not planning a return to Soviet - era state ownership of distilleries and liquor shops . " Nationalisation ( of the industry ) today is unthinkable , " he said . Vodka producers welcomed the long - awaited move , which they said should help legitimate producers and the state to cash in on Russia ' s favourite alcoholic beverage . " The state will have additional revenues , the overall quality will rise . Fewer people will get poisoned with bad vodka , " Vladimir Yarmosh of the producers ' association Spirtprom told Reuters . In Soviet times , as well as before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution , the state used to draw up to one third of its revenues from the vodka industry . Yarmosh said he expected that production and sales of vodka would account for up to 12 percent of all state revenues in the future , up from the present two percent . Thursday ' s flurry of measures on taxes and pensions underlined Yeltsin ' s determination to get to grips with the nation ' s problems after a period of uncertainty linked to his heart problems . Yeltsin has spent very little time in the Kremlin since his re - election for a second term on July 3 . The 65 - year - old president underwent a quintuple bypass operation on November 5 .

HORSE RACING - HELISSIO LOOKS FOR MORE GLORY IN JAPAN CUP . Helissio , winner of this year ' s Prix de l ' Arc de Triomphe , is likely to stay in the middle of the pack before being asked for a winning sprint in Sunday ' s Japan Cup , his jockey Olivier Peslier said on Friday . The three - year - old colt is already an even - money favourite to take the world ' s richest horse race from a field of 16 that includes seven top foreign entries . Turf experts expect the French colt to start at odds - on and given the way he has worked since arriving in Japan earlier this week it is difficult to argue with bookmakers ' judgements . " He is relaxed and running well . I am satisfied . This horse will have no problem with Japan ' s fast track , " Peslier said after the colt ' s final serious workout . " In Sunday ' s race , Helissio will not necessarily lead the race from the start . We are also thinking of staying in the middle , " he added . The French - bred three - year - old colt , drawn in the middle of the field at post position nine , has won six of his seven races this year , including a magnificent five - length win in the Arc at his last start on October 6 . His most likely challengers are Awad from the United States , last year ' s winner of the Arlington Million and runner - up in the same race this year , and Australia ' s Saintly who took the country ' s coveted Melbourne Cup nearly three weeks ago . The four - year - old horse Awad is the only one of the seven foreign entries who has raced before in a Japan Cup , leaving his run too late in coming a fast - finishing fifth last year . " It ' s going to be a good race , " his jockey Chris McCarron said . " There will be no change in our strategy - - come from behind and win . " Awad , at post position 10 , is drawn alongside Helissio . There is a question mark over the once high hopes for Saintly because the four - year - old gelding did not travel well from Australia and for the first two days in Japan struggled with a cold . But he worked well on Friday and seemed to have finally thrown off the effects of the long flight . The turf track should be near - perfect for the 2 , 400 - metre race which is worth 132 million yen ( $ 1 . 3 million ) for the winner . The race starts at 3 . 20 p . m . ( 0620 GMT ) Britain is represented by Strategic Choice , winner of the 1995 Irish St Leger and Pentire , winner of the King George V1 and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot but a poor 10th to Helissio in the Arc . Ireland ' s four - year - old colt Singspiel and Flag Down , a six - year - old horse from the United States , round out the foreign entries . Japanese hopes are pinned on Bubble Gum Fellow , a three - year - old colt who was the country ' s champion two - year - old last season . He has recovered from six months off with a broken leg and on October 27 won Japan ' s Autumn Derby .

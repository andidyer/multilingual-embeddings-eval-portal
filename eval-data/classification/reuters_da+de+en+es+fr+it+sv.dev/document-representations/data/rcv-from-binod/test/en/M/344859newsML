WORLD BONDS - U . S . pros shy away from gilts in ' 97 . U . S . investment strategists pared outstanding gilt positions in the first month of 1997 , spooked by Bank of England calls for a half - point interest rate rise and sterling ' s sharp rally to four - year highs . " We are a little bit cautious on that market , but not so much that we have completely gotten rid of our overweight position , " said Michael Faust , global portfolio manager at Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser in San Francisco . " We generally like the UK , but clearly in this type of environment there is some risk in the gilt market and in sterling , " he added . Some economists warned of a continued exodus in the coming months ahead of Britain ' s general election which must be held before May 22 . On Monday , Britain ' s cabinet decided that it would aim to hold the election on May 1 . " We think offshore investors will take profits in sterling assets as the vote gets closer and then look for a safe haven until the dust settles , " said Carl Weinberg , international economist and co - author of newsletter High Frequency Economics . However , the relatively high yield of gilts and the UK ' s isolation from the currency and economic risk associated with proposed European monetary union makes a buy - and - hold strategy somewhat appealing , money managers said . " What saves this market is the notion that the yield still looks attractive relative to most everywhere else , " said Richard Koss , international economist at MFR Inc . Investors ' major impetus to book profits in January was sterling ' s impressive rally to a lofty four - year high of $ 1 . 711 on January 2 , strategists said . However , a Reuter poll of 16 analysts surveyed last week showed sterling will rise to $ 1 . 6427 by the end of the first quarter and hold steady at around $ 1 . 6344 until the end of the year . In late trade on Wednesday , sterling traded at $ 1 . 6210 . Also worrying U . S . investors was the escalating battle between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George . The release on Wednesday of the latest monetary minutes showed George took the opportunity at December ' s monetary meeting to warn that a half - point increase in base rates may be needed early this year . " Clarke focuses on manufacturing and the strong pound doesn ' t favor manufacturing , " said Brian Gendreau , international markets strategist at JP Morgan . " Clarke also doesn ' t think the UK economy is accelerating and , in addition , he probably has a shorter time horizon than George , " Gendreau said , adding he has recommended an underweight position in gilts relative to the standard portfolio benchmark since October 1996 . All strategists interviewed expected at least one Bank of England rate hike this year , but none foresaw a rise at least until after the general election has ended . " George reports to Clarke so there isn ' t any question over who will win , " Koss said . ( ( - - N . A . Treasury Des , 212 - 859 - 1677 ) )

Hilton files ITT tender offer . Hilton Hotels Corp . on Friday launched its hostile $ 6 . 5 billion offer for rival hotel and casino operator ITT Corp . setting the clock ticking for a response from ITT . In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the hotel and gambling company said it would need about $ 3 . 5 billion in financing to acquire an initial 50 . 1 percent stake in ITT , as well as pay fees , commissions and other costs . Hilton ' s formal bid , at $ 55 a share for a 50 . 1 percent stake in ITT , would give Hilton control of the company . After that , Hilton would swap its stock , with a value of $ 55 a share , for the remaining ITT shares . The offer also includes the assumption of $ 4 billion in ITT debt , giving the deal a total value of $ 10 . 5 billion . The proposed acquisition would create a hotel and gambling giant with 30 casinos and roughly $ 2 . 5 billion in annual cash flow , making it three to five times the size of its nearest rival . Hilton will raise the cash initially using banks loans or other facilities , then it will turn to public debt markets for long - term financing , sources with knowledge of the deal said . The offer will expire at midnight Feb . 28 unless it is extended . The filing gives ITT , owner of Sheraton hotels , Caesars World casinos and a host of entertainment assets , 10 business days to respond . ITT ' s board is set to meet Tuesday to discuss the offer , but ITT said it did not expect to announce a decision by then . " It ' s highly unlikely their evaluation and analysis will be completed by then , and we expect them to take the full 10 days to make their decision , " said Jim Gallagher , spokesman for ITT . In a late amendment to the SEC document , Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach asked to meet with ITT Chairman Rand Araskog in advance of the meeting and if not possible , to be able to present Hilton ' s offer to the board . Gallagher declined to comment on whether Araskog would take up Bollenbach ' s offer . The filing also revealed Hilton has been amassing over 315 , 000 shares of ITT stock since Jan . 21 . On Wednesday , Hilton said it would make the formal filing on Thursday , but later retracted that statement , leading to speculation it was having trouble raising financing . But a spokesman for Beverly Hills - based Hilton scoffed at the rumors . " The fact is we have more than enough avenues open to us to get this done , " said Marc Grossman , senior vice president corporate affairs . Grossman also defended Hilton against criticism that the delay gave ITT one extra day to line up a defensive strategy . He said Hilton ' s intent always had been to take whatever time it needed within its five - day legal limit . ITT is expected to fight the bid vigorously and has several options available , including bringing in a friendly merger partner , making its own acquisitions or selling assets . Several rumors have been circulating regarding potential partners or acquisition candidates , including names like Mirage Resorts Inc . and Harrah ' s Entertainment Inc . . Officials from Harrah ' s declined to comment and Mirage executives were not immediately available . ITT also has a section in its corporate by - laws allowing it to raise the number of its board members to ensure a majority , but the entire board would come up for re - election at a shareholder meeting likely in May and Hilton has vowed to solicit proxies in order to win board control . Hilton also has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Nevada to block ITT from taking a so - called " poison pill " , a defensive maneuver that significantly dilutes a company ' s stock and makes it more expensive to acquire . ITT ' s stock gained 37 . 5 cents to $ 57 . 25 on the New York Stock Exchange . Hilton slipped 12 . 5 cents to $ 28 . 50 , also on the NYSE .

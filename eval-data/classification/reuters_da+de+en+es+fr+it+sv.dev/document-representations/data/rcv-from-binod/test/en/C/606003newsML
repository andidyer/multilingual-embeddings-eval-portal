India ' s TISCO 96 / 97 profits seen lower . Profits of India ' s largest private steelmaker Tata Iron and Steel Company Ltd ( TISCO ) are seen flat - to - lower in 1996 / 97 ( April - March ) because of a sluggish market and tight margins , analysts said on Thursday . " I don ' t see profits rising , " said Hozefa Topiwalla , steel analyst at brokerage firm First Global Finance . " Profits will be flat . . . there might be a minor downside . " He had forecast a net profit of 5 . 89 billion rupees against 5 . 67 billion in 1995 / 96 , but said the profit was likely to be lower . TISCO ' s full - year results are due on Friday . Analysts said the firm was unable to raise prices to cover higher costs because of poor conditions , and sales volume growth was lower than expected . The company said in April that it sold 2 . 44 million tonnes of steel in the year ended March 31 , 1997 , up three percent from 2 . 36 million in the previous year . " At the start of the year we had expected volume growth of six to seven percent , " said Aniruddha Dange , analyst at ICICI Securities and Finance Company ( I - Sec ) . " Margins were squeezed as it was not able to pass on higher costs to consumers , " he said . Dange forecast net profit at 5 . 05 billion rupees . The cement division made a small operating profit in the first half but weak market conditions would have hit operations in the second half , resulting in losses , Topiwalla said . Lower ferro chromium prices would also slice profits in 1996 / 97 , he said , adding that earnings the previous year were boosted by higher ferro chromium prices . TISCO ' s continuing capital expenditure programme was mainly to modernise or upgrade facilities without additions to capacity , Topiwalla said . " We are having a sell on the stock , " he said . Dange said he expected the share to be a market performer . Analysts saw little prospect of an upturn in 1997 / 98 with steel demand seen growing at four percent in the first half , and rising to six percent in the second half and to 7 . 5 percent in 1998 / 99 . " The modestly improving demand outlook may not translate into pricing flexibility for domestic manufacturers , especially of hot rolled coils ( HRC ) because of rising supply in 1998 / 99 , " Kotak Securities and its affiliate Goldman Sachs said in a recent report . It said domestic HRC output would rise by 2 . 1 million tonnes over the next 24 months . HRC is TISCO ' s major product category , which accounted for 1 . 04 million tonnes out of total saleable steel production of 2 . 81 million tonnes in 1996 / 97 . ( $ 1 = 35 . 7 rupees )

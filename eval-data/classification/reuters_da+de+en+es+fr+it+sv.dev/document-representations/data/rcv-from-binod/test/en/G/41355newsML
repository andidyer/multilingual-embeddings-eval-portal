N . Y . C . council to probe school overcrowding . As New York City ' s schools struggled to find room for 91 , 000 more students than they have capacity for , the Council vowed to investigate the problem , while the mayor turned for help to the Roman Catholic Diocese . " We do have a crisis , it is an ongoing one , and it should be treated as such , " City Council President Peter Vallone told reporters on Monday at a news conference at City Hall . The leader of the council , who is a Democrat , called upon Gov . George Pataki , a Republican , to help solve the problem , noting that the city gives the state more revenue than it receives back as aid . Vallone said sometime ago he warned Pataki and the legislature that the city ' s school system would add 20 , 000 new students each year until at least the turn of the century . City officials , who asked not to be named , said that some of the measures New York state uses to distribute its aid for education discriminate against New York City . For example , in school building aid , the state bases the amount cities and towns receive on average construction costs throughout the state , but such expenses typically are higher in New York City than upstate . Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , a Republican , on Monday continued to press for the archdiosese ' s offer to enroll 1 , 000 of New York City ' s public schoolchildren , whose performance puts them in the bottom five percent , in Catholic schools . " We should fight for those kids instead of fighting bureaucracies , special interests and fighting out of fear , " Giuliani told reporters at City Hall . While the proposal , first made in 1991 , would appear to violate the constitution that mandates the separation of church and state , there was speculation that this might be sidestepped . For example , New York City might make contributions to private Catholic foundations instead of paying the school children ' s tuition , who would have to volunteer for the program . Speaker Vallone , who scheduled September 17 hearings into the overcrowding problem , said the question of sending public schoolchildren to parochial schools , where they would receive religous education , required study . " We can ' t do it in violation of the law . " The Council increased the Board of Education ' s four - year capital plan by $ 1 . 4 billion in the city ' s 1997 fiscal budget , which totals about $ 33 billion . However , at present additional funds for the city ' s schools do not appear to be available , although Vallone noted President Bill Clinton has proposed spending $ 5 billion to help local communities and states rebuild schools . Clinton ' s plan would provide a subsidy of up to 50 percent of the interest for building new schools and renovating existing ones . - - Joan Gralla , 212 - 859 - 1654

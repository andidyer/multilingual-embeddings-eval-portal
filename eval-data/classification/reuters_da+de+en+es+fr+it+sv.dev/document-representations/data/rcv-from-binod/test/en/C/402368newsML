Including Pharmavene ' s product development portfolio , Shire has 30 projects in its pipeline . " This acquisition is our first strategic step to become a significant international pharmaceutical company , " Stahel said . Together with the Pharmavene acquistion , Shire reported a first - half pretax loss of 0 . 1 million stg , which compares with a 4 . 6 million stg profit a year earlier . The results were hit by licencing and co - development arrangements with Johnson and Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen for Galantamine . This depressed operating profit by 5 . 96 million stg . " Excluding the exceptional nature of these arrangements , the group ' s underlying trading position improved significantly in the half year under review , " Shire said . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

FORECAST - Digital signals sought from BSkyB . The stock market will be seeking an update on BSkyB ' s digital satellite plans when the pay television giant releases third quarter results next Wednesday . BSkyB has said it plans to launch 200 - channel digital satellite services into the UK by the end of this year but a delay now appears possible . The broadcaster said in February that an order for up to one million digital decoders was " imminent " but that order has yet to be placed with manufacturers . Some market analysts now believe the digital satellite launch may not come until early 1998 , missing the important pre - Christmas shopping period . Most analysts are forecasting pre - tax profit of around 80 million pounds for the three months to end - March , up more than 10 percent on the 71 . 2 million figure a year ago . BSkyB now has more than 5 . 5 million UK subscribers and is expected to add a further 200 - 300 , 000 in what is normally a quiet quarter . Most of the growth is likely to come from new cable subscribers as demand for satellite dishes stabilises . Progress on digital satellite has been complicated by BSkyB ' s plans to join forces with British Telecommunications Plc and other partners to form a new company to subsidise set - top boxes . Recent newspaper reports suggest that BSkyB is seeking a total investment of up to 700 million stg . It wants to subsidise the price of the boxes down as low as 200 stg from a full retail cost of around 400 pounds . BSkyB , which recently abandoned plans for a digital joint venture with Germany ' s Kirch Group , is aiming to be part of digital terrestrial television when that is set up in Britain next year . It has joined forces with ITV giants Granada and Carlton to apply for three DTT licences . The trio , grouped together under the British Digital Broadcasting umbrella , want to offer 15 pay channels . DTT will supply a minimum of 30 channels and can be received on ordinary set - top aerials . British Digital Broadcasting faces opposition for the licences from DTN , owned by communications company NTL Inc . The Independent Television Commission is expected to award the licences in late May . - - Keith Weir , London Newsroom + 44 171 542 8793

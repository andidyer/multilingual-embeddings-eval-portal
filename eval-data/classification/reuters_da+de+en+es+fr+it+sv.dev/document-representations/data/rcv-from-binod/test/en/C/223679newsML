Olivetti slips after Colaninno comments . Olivetti shares slipped on the Milan bourse on Thursday after comments by chief executive Roberto Colaninno linked to worries over a possible inquiry into the struggling group and delays in its sell - off plans . Colaninno told a parliamentary industry committee on Wednesday that the sale of its personal computer company , which was planned to be completed by the end of the year , could be delayed , while the sell - off of speciality computer group Tecnost could be reviewed . After Olivetti sold a stake in mobile phone consortium Omnitel last month to Mannesmann for 432 billion lire , the sale of PCs and Tecnost were hoped to provide most of the cash to bring Olivetti ' s target sell - off plan for 1996 up to 800 billion lire . Colaninno also warned yesterday that if an official inquiry were launched into Olivetti , the company would lose its customers overnight and the move could finish the group off . Olivetti shares were off 3 . 47 percent at 528 lire , while Tecnost shares were suspensed after a sharp fall . - - Milan newsroom + 392 66129502

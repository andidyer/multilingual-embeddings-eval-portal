INTERVIEW - Tesco eyes profits from j - v . British supermarket group Tesco Plc expects itself and partner Royal Bank of Scotland to invest around 40 million stg in their financial services joint venture in the first year , Tesco marketing director Tim Mason said . " There could be a five to ten million loss in year one , moving towards profit in two to three years , " he added in a telephone interview with Reuters . Mason said that Tesco hoped to see similar profits from the venture to those gained by retailer Marks & Spencer from its financial services , which were around 61 million stg in the year ending March 31 , 1996 . " If we didn ' t feel we could do that sort of level medium term then we would not be as interested as we are , " he said . Mason said some of the investment would be in setting up the joint venture , which will aim to offer an international credit card and , over time , savings accounts and personal insurance . There will be marketing costs , he said , and capital funding of products . " The better it goes , the more it takes , " he said . Tesco and Royal Bank announced they would link up in a financial services joint venture earlier on Thursday . Mason said Tesco expected the financial services venture to offer " simple products tailored to the individual , " adding that the supermarket was " determined the joint venture will offer outstanding value . " He said Royal Bank " shares that view . " Tesco spoke to a number of possible partners before linking up with Royal Bank , Mason said , but Royal Bank was able to meet the criteria , including offering a full range of services , along with its experience of Direct Line telephone banking . Mason said Tesco ' s current partner on its ClubCard Plus interest paying account , National Westminster Bank , had " done a good job . " Tesco will open Personal Finance Shops in stores , starting off with its largest outlets , with the aim of having the offer in the " first few branches by the end of the year , " Mason said . Mason said if the venture was a success , Tesco could open Personal Finance Shops in up to 300 of its outlets , which total over 550 currently . Mason said Tesco would not need a banking licence to operate in the financial services sector in the joint venture , but envisaged applying for one " as time goes by . " Rival supermarket chain J . Sainsbury Plc has just gained a licence for the launch of its Sainsbury ' s Bank , in which it holds 55 percent with Bank of Scotland taking 45 percent . Mason said he did not think Tesco was playing catch - up with Sainsbury by launching personal finance services . He said Tesco was waiting " to be absolutely sure we could add value to our relationship with our customers rather than just making money out of them .

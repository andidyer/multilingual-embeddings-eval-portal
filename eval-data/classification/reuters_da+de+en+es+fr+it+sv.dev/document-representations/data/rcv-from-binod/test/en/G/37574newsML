" So far , so good " in northern Iraq - Pentagon chief . The United States is so far satisfied that Iraqi troops are leaving Kurdish areas in the north but it will watch developments closely to ensure that continues , Defense Secretary William Perry said on Friday . " So far , so good , " Perry told reporters when asked if he was satisfied with the withdrawal of Iraq President Saddam Hussein ' s forces from northern regions of his country where Iraqi Kurds occupy a " safe haven " under U . N . protection . Iraqi military intervention in that region prompted U . S . retaliation earlier this week , with cruise missile strikes on anti - aircraft facilities in the south . President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday that the strikes had achieved his goal of forcing Saddam to withdraw from the north . U . S . intelligence and State Department spokesmen have said , however , that the withdrawal may not account for Iraqi security agents left behind among the Kurds . Perry offered a caution of his own , saying : " I do not want to be complacent about this at all . We are watching very , very carefully and we will base our future actions on what Saddam Hussein does . " His comment was in line with the U . S . position that it will not rule out further retaliatory strikes if need be . But it also continued the policy of accentuating the positive despite some skepticism , in Congress and elsewhere , that the U . S . strikes will have much restraining effect on Saddam . " The latest information we have is that the mechanized and the armored forces of the Iraqi troops have been pulling to the south , " Perry said . " The artillery shelling of Charchamal has stopped . Generally , we see positive developments in northern Iraq . " In addition to the attacks , the United States expanded a no - fly zone over southern Iraq which was established after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims from Saddam ' s forces . Saddam said this week that Iraq would no longer recognize the southern no - fly zone or a similar zone in northern Iraq established to protect the Kurds . The U . S . attacks have sparked strong opposition from Russia and China , and France said on Thursday its warplanes will not help U . S . and British warplanes police the expanded part of the southern no - fly zone . Some senior members of Congress have suggested that the United States might have to launch further attacks because Saddam was still in a position to threaten Kurds and other countries in the region . Former U . S . Ambassador to Iraq Edward Peck and former Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle on Friday were sharply critical of Clinton and the U . S . attacks in an interview on Fox television . They said the missile attacks were politically motivated , had done little to deter Saddam and had weakened the U . S . - led coalition that defeated Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War . " It ' s awful hard to find any advantages that accrue to the United States from this , " said Peck in response to claims by Clinton this week that the attacks were successful . " The only reason we are doing this to Saddam Hussein , I think , is because we said we were going to do it , and you ' re stuck with having to carry out your threats . " Perle said Saddam had gotten away with killing Kurds and paid little for it with his military strike into the north . " He was able to strike and make a tactical withdrawal and get away with it , " Perle said . " It ' s a little like saying that someone who robs a bank has failed because he withdraws from the bank , even though he has got the cash . "

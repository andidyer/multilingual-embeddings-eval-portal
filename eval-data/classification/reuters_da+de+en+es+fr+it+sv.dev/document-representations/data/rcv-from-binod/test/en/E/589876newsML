U . S . threatens to leave Americas trade talks . The United States slammed down its foot at a key ministerial free - trade meeting on Friday , warning its partners in the Americas it might " pack its bags " unless more concrete decisions were taken , according to Brazilian government sources . U . S . Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she could not sign the draft declaration prepared for her and other regional ministers from Canada to Argentina meeting to discuss setting up the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) . " If we remain in this half - way zone , it would be better to pack our bags and go home , " Barshefsky said , according to a Brazilian government source with access to the meeting . The top U . S . trade official was addressing trade and foreign ministers from 33 other countries in the region meeting in Belo Horizonte to decide when to start formal negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) . Launched at the Miami summit in 1994 , the FTAA envisioned a free trade zone of nearly one billion consumers and combined gross domestic product of over $ 9 . 0 trillion . " This declaration ( in Belo Horizonte ) is inconsistent with what happened in Miami . We are trying to rewrite Miami and this cannot be agreed to by the United States , " Barshefsky said , according to a Portuguese translation of her address . The Belo Horizonte talks have floundered on a north - south divide , with the United States pushing for speed in negotiating regional free trade and South America ' s Mercosur trade bloc of Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay and Paraguay urging caution . All would like to start formal talks after a presidential FTAA summit in Chile next March . But , while Mercosur wants to negotiate in stages , with tariff cuts left until last , the United States wants to discuss everything from tariff to subsidies at the same time . The result is that ministers will have to decide on Friday when they debate the draft declaration whether they " will " or " should " launch formal trade talks in March 1998 . " What is going on is a war of equilibrium ( between the United States and Mercosur ) , " said Stefan Bogdan Salej , president of the Minas Gerais industry federation FIEMG . Earlier on Friday , Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia reaffirmed his country ' s cautious stance as he opened the ministerial meeting . " We are not engaged here in some exercise of rhetoric that will lead us to a declaration of principles of a merely symbolic or exhortative value , " Lampreia said . " We are engaged in what might very well prove to be the greatest initiative of commercial diplomacy of the majority of our countries in the coming years , " he said . The ministers will also have to decide on Friday whether to allow the labour movement a greater role in the negotiating process . Business leaders already hold official parallel forums to FTAA meetings . Lampreia distributed to his counterparts a " Manifesto of the Workers of the Americas " , drafted earlier in the week by trade unionists meeting in Belo Horizonte and which demands workers ' rights be safe - guarded . Sebastiao do Rego Barros , executive secretary of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , said some countries criticised the distribution of the manifesto .

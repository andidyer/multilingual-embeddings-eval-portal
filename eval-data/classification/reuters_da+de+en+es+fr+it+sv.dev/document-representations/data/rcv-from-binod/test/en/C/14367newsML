Pemex head sees natural gas imports declining . Adrian Lajous , director general of state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) , said natural gas imports following a deadly accident last month would decline shortly to less than 200 million cubic feet per day . Lajous told reporters at a ceremony marking the anniversary of the Mexican Petroleum Institute that natural gas supply in Mexico was back to " 100 percent " following the July 26 explosion at the Cactus gas - processing . " We have good news . ( On Thursday ) the Pajaritos plant started to process 200 million cubic feet per day . This is enabling us to reduce imports of natural gas and we hope in coming days to cut them to less than 200 million cubic feet per day , " he said . He said one of the Cactus plants was totally destroyed in the blast , but parts of another one were still salvageable . At least six people died in the blast . - - Henry Tricks , Mexico City newsroom + 525 728 - 9560

Eurocopter sees 1998 profit , eyes Tiger contract . Franco - German helicopter maker Eurocopter expects to approach breakeven or make a small loss for 1997 and go into profit in 1998 , a senior Eurocopter executive said . " Eurocopter will be close to break even or make a small loss this year , " the executive said recently , adding that it expected to make a profit of between three to 3 . 5 percent of turnover in 1998 and hit five percent of turnover in 1999 . Eurocopter is 70 percent owned by French state - owned Aerospatiale and 30 percent by Germany ' s Daimler - Benz Aerospace ( Dasa ) . Eurocopter expects to sign with the German procurement authorities on June 20 , during the Paris Air Show , a 730 million mark contract for tooling up for the Tiger combat helicopter , the executive said . The contract is based on unit prices for 160 Tigers , equally split between France and Germany , agreed with the DGA French procurement agency , he said . He declined to detail the prices . He said the prices were similar to Eurocopter ' s tender to sell 80 Tigers to Britain , which in 1995 chose 67 Apache helicopters from McDonnell Douglas for 2 . 5 billion stg . The tooling up contract pays for setting up production lines in Donauworth near Munich and Marignane near Marseille , as well as full documentation for order specifications . Contract negotiations on the first production batch will begin in early 1998 , the executive said . Of the 80 Tigers being bought by the French army , 70 are ground support versions and 10 anti - tank models . Germany ' s 80 are all anti - tank Tigers . Eurocopter said in April its 1996 consolidated loss was between 350 and 400 million francs . The company has been hit by declining military orders and has only recently seen an upturn in civil markets following a stagnation which forced it into losses in consecutive years .

Thailand sees compromise in WTO on labour dispute . Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan predicted on Monday that a compromise would be reached over issues dividing the United States and developing countries at the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) meeting here . Amnuay told a news conference that disagreements on labour standards , the shape of an investment accord and slow implementation of previous agreements to liberalise the agriculture and textile industries should be ironed out . " We expect that in the next 48 hours , we will reach an agreement . I ' m sure we will find something acceptable to all . " Amnuay said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) is adamant against including labour standards in the WTO and will also oppose the granting of national treatment for foreign companies in a multilateral investment agreement . " It ' s another matter to link these social issues to trading processes . I don ' t think the world is ready for that , " he said . ASEAN is unanimous " that we will not accept national treatment in a multilateral investment agreement , " he added . Thailand also wants some flexibility on a telecommunications agreement , especially in the time frame of its implementation and the kind of products it may cover . ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam .

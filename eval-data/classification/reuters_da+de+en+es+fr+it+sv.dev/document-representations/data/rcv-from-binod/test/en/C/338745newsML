Shamrock interested in wider Koor stake . Shamrock Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it would offer to buy Bank Hapoalim ' s stake in Koor Industries Ltd if the bank were forced to divest the shares . Shamrock , a U . S . investment company controlled by the family of Roy Disney , already has a 22 . 5 percent stake in Koor , Israel ' s largest holding company . Hapoalim holds 22 . 7 percent of Koor . The offer , by Stanley Gold , Shamrock ' s president and Koor ' s chairman , was apparently in response to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ' s decision on Monday to explore the legal ramifications of forcing Hapoalim to sell its entire holdings in Koor and Clal Israel . A committee was named to report back within two weeks , but government sources said Netanyahu was unlikely to support the measure . Under existing bank reform legislation Hapoalim is required to divest its holdings in either Koor or Clal and lower its stake in the remaining company to 25 percent . Hapoalim holds 30 . 5 percent of Clal . Gold told reporters that if the Israeli government " really wants to get the most money for the Israeli taxpayer " it should change the law that prohibits companies from buying their own shares . " I assure you , Koor ( would be ) the highest bidder , " he said , referring to the Bank Hapoalim stake . " If that doesn ' t work , then Shamrock and its partners are very interested in the shares and I believe would be a bidder for those shares , if and when the government decides to put them up for sale , " Gold said . Amending the law is one of several measures recommended last October by the Brodet committee on capital market reform . The government has not yet approved the recommendations . Gold was speaking at a news conference after Canada ' s Nortel signed a deal completing its $ 45 million purchase of 20 percent of Koor ' s Telrad telecommunications unit . - Tel Aviv newsroom , 972 - 3 - 537 - 2211

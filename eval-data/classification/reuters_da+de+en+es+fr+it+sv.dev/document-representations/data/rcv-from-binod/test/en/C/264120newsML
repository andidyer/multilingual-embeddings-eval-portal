Mori Denki cuts share issue plan , mulls convertible . Industrial lighting equipment maker Mori Denki Manufacturing Co Ltd said on Wednesday that it would issue fewer new shares than originally planned and was considering issuing foreign currency - denominated convertible bonds . Mori said in a statement that president of shopping centre operator Shinshin Shoji KK , Shodai Nitta , would increase his stake in Mori by 1 . 3 million shares , far less than originally planned , on December 20 through a new share allotment . As a result , Nitta would hold 2 . 5 million shares , or a 10 . 6 percent stake , in Mori and remain as the largest shareholder , Mori said . Mori said in October that it had agreed on a business and equity tie - up with Shinshin and that it would issue eight million new shares in a third party allotment to Nitta . Mori said at that time that the new shares would be issued on November 19 at an issue price of 415 per share , but later on in November it postponed the issue by one month to December 19 . It also said that it changed its October plan and decided to issue 7 . 2 million new shares at an issue price of 456 yen per share .

RTRS - Fiscal cuts to slow Japan in short term - BOJ . The tightening of Japan ' s fiscal policy from April and depressed demand for funds will slow Japan ' s economy in the short term , an adviser to the Governor of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) told Reuters on Monday . Kengo Inoue , research and statistics adviser to the BOJ Governor , also said the research had not found any strong evidence that the banking sectors problems with bad loans had hit the economy ' s recovery . Inoue was speaking to Reuters at a business conference in Sydney where he delivered a speech on the Japanese banking sector and its effects on the economy . " Maybe temporarily , we do expect some sort of slowdown in the pace of recovery after April , but the capital investment by firms is increasing and that surely will be accompanied by a rise in the demand for loans , " he said when asked if the combination of depressed private sector demand for funds and the fiscal tightening from April 1 would impact on the economy . " So if the government doesn ' t borrow from the banking sector , firms will , I think . " He was also not worried about the prospect of " crowding out " of the private sector in the recovery despite the financial sector ' s current preference to lend to the public sector . Although the fiscal tightening would slow the economy , Inoue said there was a need to put Japan ' s " fiscal house in order . " If the fiscal spending had been to improve infrastructure that was a positive thing , but he said it was generally thought the money had not been well spent . " So that if money is spent by private entities there will be less distortion in resource allocation , and we will have better increase in productivity which in the long run enhances the living standards of the nation , " Inoue said . The question of the impact of the banking industry ' s problems on the economy was one that the BOJ was very interested in , and had done research on . " We didn ' t find any strong evidence that this problem has hit the recovery , " he said . " The evidence at best are mixed and we can ' t say that this problem hindered the recovery to a considerable degree . " On the banking sector ' s problems , he thought the sector as a whole had passed the worst , and with measures now in place such as deposit insurance , the system was better equipped to deal with future problems , he said . " Well there are some improvements in the way the problem is addressed , and the way many banks make provision for future writeoffs , so the system as a whole is in a better situation , " Inoue said . - - John Mair Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 1800

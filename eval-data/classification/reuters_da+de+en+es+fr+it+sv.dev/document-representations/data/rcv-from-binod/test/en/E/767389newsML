RTRS - Costello says govt policy to keep rates low . Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday that it was the government ' s policy to keep interest rates low . The Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) earlier announced a 0 . 5 percentage point reduction in official cash interest rates to 5 . 0 percent , the fifth rate cut in a year . " Having got interest rates down , I can assure you it is very much part of our policy to keep them there , " Costello told reporters . He said the rate cuts announced in late 1996 were still working their way through the economy and that the benefits of the remaining two rate cuts were yet to materialise . The central bank began lowering rates last July , with two cuts in the final few months of 1996 , one on May 23 this year , and again on Wednesday . Each time it reduced the official cash rate by 50 basis points . " Interest rates work their way through the economy on a 12 month to 18 month delay , " Costello said . " What that means is that we are now - business is now - - just starting to feel the benefits of rate reductions that were occurring in the latter part of last year , " he said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

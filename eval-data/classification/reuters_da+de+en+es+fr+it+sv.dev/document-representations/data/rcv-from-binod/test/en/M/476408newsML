INSIGHT - Dow tests critical support at 6600 . The Dow Jones Industrial Average was testing critical technical support at the 6600 level on Monday during a second session of steep losses . The 6600 level " is very important and if it should happen to break that would mean 6300 , " said Robert Dickey , technical analyst at Dain Bosworth . The Dow was off 105 points , or 1 . 5 percent , at 6637 in late morning trading on Monday . Earlier in the session the index hit 6599 before paring its losses . The Dow fell 140 points on Thursday in a selloff triggered by the move by the 30 - year Treasury bond yield over the seven percent level . U . S . financial markets were closed Friday . The seven - percent yield on the long bond is seen as drawing investors away from stocks into bonds . Analysts said that a move by the long bond yield through the 7 . 2 percent level would mean an even more serious psycholgical and technical breakdown for stocks . The long bond was down 1 / 32 to yield 7 . 09 percent on Monday . Techical analysts said the Dow support around the 6600 level was built by Dow highs in November and December and its January low . Ricky Harrington , technical analyst analyst , Interstate / Johnson Lane , pointed to 6400 as the next key support after 6600 . He said he did not expect any broad rallies off the support levels . " I would only look for a technical rebound , not much of a rally , from any one of these supports , " Harrington said . " I think the market has broken down and I think you ' re going to see continued and increased volatility . " Technical analysts said the put / call ratio has been relatively low in recent sessions , a sign that there was not sufficient bearish sentiment to provide support for stocks . A higher ratio would indicate investors are buying put options , which allow them to sell stocks at a specified price . Technical analysts view higher bearish sentiment as a contrary indicator and a positive for stocks . " I ' m pretty nervous the way people are so complacent about this pullback , " Dickey said . However , Frank Gretz , technical analyst at Shields & Co , said the put / call ratio had picked up Monday morning . European investors returning Tuesday from the long Easter weekend holiday could add to the selling , leading to a " washout " in U . S . stocks that would provide a near - term bottom , he said . " It all suggest we could be close to a low here , at least temporarily , " Gretz said . ( ( - - Wall St Desk , 212 - 859 - 1721 ) )

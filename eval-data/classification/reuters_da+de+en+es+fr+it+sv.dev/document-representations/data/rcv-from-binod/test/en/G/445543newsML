S . African justice minister welcomes Boesak home . South African priest Allan Boesak , undaunted by charges he stole anti - apartheid aid funds during his years of political struggle , returned home on Sunday to a hero ' s welcome with cheering supporters carrying him shoulder high and reaching out to touch him . Justice Minister Dullah Omar led a crowd of about a thousand in an ecstatic airport welcome for Boesak , who led the struggle against apartheid side - by - side with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu when emergency rule silenced most other opposition during the final decade of white rule . " I have come back to this country , my country , my home , because I am not afraid to face those who have charged me ; because I am , as they know , totally innocent of the charges they have levelled against me . " Boesak , former leader of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches , left the country two years ago when the Scandinavian DanChurch Aid agency laid charges of fraud and theft involving more than a million rand of funding intended for the poor . Boesak , who has spent the past two years preaching in the United States , was carried shoulder high to a giant tent while supporters cheered and reached out to touch him . Omar , who has been strongly criticised for publicly pledging his solidarity with Boesak a week ago , said he was instructed by President Nelson Mandela to welcome him home . " Comrade President said to me : Dullah , you ' re going to the airport . So as I speak here to welcome Comrade Allan on your behalf , I do so on behalf of the whole of the African National Congress ( ANC ) . " Omar , leader of the ruling ANC in the Western Cape province , denied that there was any conflict between his public support for Boesak and his position as minister of justice . " As minister of justice , I have not interfered in the ( judicial ) process . . . I have done my duty as minister . I did not interfere in the investigation , " he said . He said after hugging Boesak and his wife he could not forget the clergyman ' s role in the struggle against white rule , which , he said , was not yet over . " We think and President Mandela thinks . . . that the elections in 1994 did not do enough . We don ' t think that completed the democracy in our country . " While there was political change in 1994 , there was no economic change , there was no social change . The conditions of our people remained the same , " he said . Boesak , known during the struggle both for his commitment to democracy and for his lavish lifestyle , returned to Cape Town with his wife Elna and his five - year - old daughter Sarah Len after four days spent consulting lawyers in Pretoria . He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday to face 21 charges of theft and fraud in the 1980s . The case is likely to be postponed until April and possibly till August and an ANC spokesman said the trial was expected to last at least eight months . Supporters chanted " Boesak , Boesak " , danced the toyi - toyi that typified the struggle against white rule and jeered reporters , whom they accused of driving the popular Cape Town activist out of the country more than two years ago . " This is our man . He was the best leader we ever had in the Western Cape and I will support him to the end - every day while he is in court . Dr Boesak belongs to us , " said Miriam Ibrahim , who arrived with a busload of supporters . Provincial Health Minister Ebrahim Rasool , who joined the welcoming committee , told Reuters : " I am here because I don ' t believe that anything can erase 20 years of solid contribution to the struggle . " An ANC spokesman declined to confirm or deny that Boesak would meet Mandela soon .

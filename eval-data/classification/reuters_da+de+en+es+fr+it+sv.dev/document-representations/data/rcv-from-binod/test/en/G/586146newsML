Mexico vows more housecleaning on drug corruption . Mexico will continue to root out drug corruption throughout the government , even if it means more embarrassing scandals , Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria told the Mexican Congress late on Wednesday . " If that is the price , well , we ' re going to have to continue with the scandals because we are going to continue cleaning our house , " Gurria said . Just such a scandal rocked Mexico in February , when authorities arrested the country ' s top anti - drugs warrior , Gen . Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , on charges he was on the payroll of a leading drug trafficker . Mexico arrested Gutierrez Rebollo even though it was bound to create a stir just ahead of the U . S . " certification " process , in which the U . S . president and Congress determine publicly whether certain countries like Mexico are cooperating in the drug fight . Mexico eventually retained its certification after a heated debate in Washington and outrage in Mexico , where the U . S . judging of other countries is considered hollow because of the enormous demand for illegal drugs north of the border . Gurria said the Gutierrez Rebollo incident " damaged " Mexico ' s reputation in the United States , saying there was a " loss of confidence , questions over the ( anti - drug ) policy and the commitment of Mexico in in this area . " Mexico can expect even more U . S . criticism , but that will not deter Mexico ' s anti - drug effort , Gurria said . " It ' s a fact that the certification process is going to continue , " Gurria told Congress . The foreign minister had been called before the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to give his assessment of U . S . President Bill Clinton ' s recent visit to Mexico , the session turned to other bilateral issues . Clinton did not address the Mexican Congress during his May 5 - 7 visit , which many Mexicans considered a snub . But Gurria said such an address was impossible because of Clinton ' s tight schedule and that his visit was " a total success . " Clinton ' s trip coincided with a meeting of the Binational Commission - - a kind of joint annual cabinet meeting - - between the United States and Mexico . " It should be underscored that this is a unique mechanism , that the United States has this with no other country in the world , " Gurria said .

Hundreds of Tutsis flee Zaire capital to Congo . About 400 Banyamulenge Tutsis in dugout canoes escaped from Zaire ' s capital into Congo on Monday after a wave of anti - Tutsi feeling in Zaire whose army is battling Banyamulenge rebels . Refugee officials said the new arrivals brought to about 600 the number of Tutsis who have crossed into Brazzaville in the last two weeks from Kinshasa , the Zairean capital which is across the Congo river . They are believed to have sneaked through unguarded crossing points or bribed their way through . Congolese refugee officials registered the new arrivals , but neither the government nor international relief agencies have made plans to house of cater for them . The Tutsis all refused to make any statements on arrival . Anti - Tutsi passion is high in Kinshasa following two weeks of fighting in which the army has lost ground to rebels in Zaire ' s eastern border provinces of North and South Kivu . Protests gripped Kinshasa last week and many Banyamulenge families reported relatives missing . Many went into hiding . Another march is planned in Kinshasa for Tuesday . Fighting flared two weeks ago following attempts by provincial authorities backed by the army to expel Banyamulenge Tutsis whose ancestors settled from Rwanda 200 years ago . Zaire accuses them of being surrogates of Rwanda ' s Tutsi army which won civil war in 1994 , sending more than one million majority Hutus fleeing into Zaire .

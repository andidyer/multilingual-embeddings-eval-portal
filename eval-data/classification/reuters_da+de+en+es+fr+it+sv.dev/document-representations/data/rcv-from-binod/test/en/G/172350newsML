W . Africans pledge 2 , 200 more Liberia peacekeepers . Army chiefs of staff from West Africa pledged on Wednesday to provide 2 , 249 extra soldiers for their Liberia peacekeeping force but asked the international community to supply promised logistical support first . " The member states agreed to send the troops but logistical support promised by the international community must be delivered first , " said Edouardo Benjamin , executive secretary of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) . " We are doing everything to get those logistics from our foreign friends who promised them , " he told reporters . The chiefs of staff were meeting ahead of talks in Liberia ' s capital Monrovia on Thursday of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine , which is monitoring progress towards peace in Liberia . Ghana , Mali , Niger , Burkina Faso , Gambia and Benin promised to supply the extra troops . Ghana , Mali and Gambia already serve with the 8 , 000 - strong , Nigerian - led force , which restored peace to Monrovia after Liberia ' s almost seven - year - old civil war flared again in April and May . West African leaders brokered a deal in August in Nigeria . It envisaged disarmament by January and elections by May with individual sanctions against anyone derailing the deal . Benjamin said a ceasefire violation committee was reviewing cases with a view to action against guilty parties . The peacekeeping force is ensuring security of faction leaders on the interim ruling State Council after a failed bid last week to kill Charles Taylor , who launched the war in 1989 . Freed American slaves set up Liberia in 1847 .

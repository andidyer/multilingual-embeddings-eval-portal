LIPA optimistic on LILCO / Brooklyn Union merger . The Long Island Power Authority ( LIPA ) said it was cautiously optimistic that a proposed merger of Long Island Lighting Co ( LILCO ) and Brooklyn Union Gas was a positive step to lower rates for LILCO ' s 1 . 1 million customers . " The combination of LILCO and Brooklyn Union can be a positive step , " LIPA chairman Frank Zabb told a LIPA trustees meeting here . Trustee member Jonathan Sinnreich said a combination of public and private ownership of LILCO assets would maximize the potential savings for LILCO consumers . Zabb said the merger would allow the new company to compete effectively in a deregulated environment and hopefully result in savings of at least $ 10 billion for customers over a 10 - year period . On December 29 , 1996 , Brooklyn Union and LILCO agreed to merge in a stock deal that would create a $ 4 billion electric and natural gas company . LILCO charges some of the highest electric rates in the U . S . , saddled by a liability tied to its Shoreham nuclear power plant , which never opened . Zabb said he hopes the merger would result in double digit savings for local consumers and resolve the tax issue between LILCO and Suffolk County . On November 7 , a state judge ordered Suffolk County and the Brookhaven Town government to refund to LILCO as much as $ 1 . 1 billion in property taxes for the Shoreham plant . LILCO and Brooklyn Union previously said they will continue talks with LIPA over LIPA ' s plan to acquire the Shoreham plant along with its debt , which would be refinanced . Zabb said the LIPA board will negotiate " within a matter of weeks " with the two companies . Richard Kessel , another LIPA trustee , said the new company resulting from the merger must be made accountable to the public . " The utility has not been accountable in many ways , " Kessel said , referring to LILCO . " This must not be a paper transaction . " ( ( - - New York Power Desk + 1 212 859 1622 ) )

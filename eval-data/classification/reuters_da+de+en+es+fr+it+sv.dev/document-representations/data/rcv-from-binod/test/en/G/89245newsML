Afghan warlord moves to hold tunnel from Taleban . A strong Afghan faction led by Uzbek warlord General Rashid Dostum has moved to secure a strategic road tunnel and keep it out of the hands of the Taleban militia , a faction spokesman said on Tuesday . " Our forces moved forward three or four days ago and took positions abandoned by the government ( of deposed President Burnahuddin Rabbani ) around the tunnel , " Jumbish - i - Milli faction spokesman General Mohammed Yusef told reporters . The tunnel , situated around 70 km ( 45 miles ) northwest of the Afghan capital Kabul , forms part of the Salang highway , a vital link between the capital and the north of the country and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia beyond . Taleban said on Tuesday its forces had reached the southern mouth of the Salang tunnel , north of Kabul , where they had been stopped by Dostum ' s forces . The official Kabul Radio , monitored in Islamabad , said that there had been no clashes so far . The radical Islamic Taleban militia reportedly entered the nearby town of Jabal - Us - Siraj on Monday . Dostum , an ethnic Uzbek and the head of the Jumbish - I - Milli , or the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan , controls a large swathe of territory in northern Afghanistan . A few refugees have trickled out of Kabul along the Salang highway which cuts through treacherous mountain passes and trackless desert . Hassabullah , an ethnic Tajik , said he left Kabul with his brother , their wives and 10 children for fear of the Taleban . " They don ' t like Tajiks , " he said simply . The Taleban are predominantly ethnic Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan . Hassabullah arrived in Mazar - i - Sharif on Monday , about 450 km ( 300 miles ) northwest of Kabul , inside Dostum ' s territory . His gaggle of dazed children , in bright pink and green shirts , found shelter at a refugee camp of mud bricks originally built for those displaced in fighting around Kabul four years ago . Dostum ' s men and armour are strung out along the Salang highway at scattered intervals , some in small mud forts . The road was mostly empty as we drove down it on Monday save for goats , camels and wrecked armoured vehicles left over from the Soviet occupation . They loomed like skeletons out of the haze of a sandstorm . As the Taleban move northwards following their lightning seizure of Kabul last week , Dostum ' s territory is gripped with tension . Dostum has kept silent on his next move after the fall of Kabul . His aides will not confirm widely rumoured meetings between Jumbish - i - Milli and both the deposed government and the Taleban . " We do not want to start fighting , we ' ve never fought the Taleban , " said the faction ' s spokesman , General Yusef . " We are ready to talk to them . " But the majority of Afghans in the north fear a Taleban advance and their fundamentalist brand of islam . An Afghan man working for an international aid agency in Mazar - i - Sharif paused momentarily to find a word to describe the Taleban . " Animals , " he concluded vehemently , " They are animals .

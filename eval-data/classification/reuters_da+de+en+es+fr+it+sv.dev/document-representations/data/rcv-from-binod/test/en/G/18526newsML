U . S . ARMY SELLS EXCESS EQUIPMENT TO HUNGARIANS . Hungarians will have an opportunity to buy excess equipment from the U . S . IFOR peacekeeping contingent based in Hungary , a U . S . Army official said on Wednesday . The excess property - ranging from livestock to pontoon bridges - does not include military equipment , U . S . Army Colonel Greg Gustafson told reporters . Most of the equipment , such as the pontoon bridges and winter clothing , is no longer needed as it was used during the initial phase of the IFOR operation at the turn of the year when the 20 , 000 - strong U . S . contingent was brought into Bosnia through Hungary , he said . Gustafson was unable to say whether the sale means that the U . S . contingent is leaving Hungary in December , when the current IFOR mandate for Bosnia is due to expire . " This decision will be taken at a much higher level , it ' s a political decision , " he said . The sale will be mediated by the Hungarian Defence Ministry ' s Logistics Directorate . Despite the exhaustive list of equipment on offer , some Hungarians are likely to be disappointed as it does not include any vehicles . Hungarians were expecting to be able get their hands on the so - called Humvee , a jeep that rose to icon status during the Gulf war . " The Hummer does not meet civilian safety regulations , " Gustafson said .

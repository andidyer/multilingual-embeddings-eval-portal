Indonesian rupiah firms on liquidity , swaps up . The Indonesian rupiah firmed against the dollar in moderate early trading on Wednesday on the back of relatively expensive overnight rates , dealers said . They said the spot market was driven by liquidity while forwards inched up on the tight money market and also on fears of the Thai factor . One European bank dealer spoke of underlying concerns that Indonesia would emulate Thailand in a swap squeeze despite denials by the central bank . " The Thai factor and relatively high overnight rates have driven forwards higher , " the dealer said . Overnight rupiah eased slightly to 14 . 5 percent from 17 . 0 percent . Overnight swaps declined to 0 . 6 from 1 . 0 , equivalent to about 20 percent . One dealer in Singapore said the rupiah came under upward pressure following the tight market , however , the rupiah was likely to hit strong resistance at the 2 , 425 . 0 level . " I think the rupiah is a good sell at the 2 , 425 . 0 level . Further upswing is limited by the ( intervention ) band . " The dealer said offshore focus was largely on the Thai baht and the ringgit , causing a spillover on Jakarta forward rates . Spot rupiah was at 2 , 426 . 7 / 27 . 0 at 0300 GMT , compared with an opening of 2 , 427 . 0 / 28 . 0 . Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2 , 426 . 40 / 26 . 70 and 2 , 425 . 70 / 26 . 00 , respectively . One - month swaps edged up to 13 . 75 / 14 . 50 from 13 . 25 / 14 . 00 , two to 28 . 5 / 20 . 0 from 26 . 25 / 26 . 75 , three to 42 . 5 / 44 . 0 from 39 . 5 / 41 . 0 and six to 82 . 5 / 85 . 0 from 80 . 0 / 82 . 0 points . The European bank dealer said local operators were seen taking profits from the forward market although offshore players continued to overborrow the rupiah . The central bank kept its intervention band at 2 , 422 / 2 , 614 and its conversion band at 2 , 422 / 2 , 470 on Tuesday . - - Jakarta newsroom + 6221 384 - 6364

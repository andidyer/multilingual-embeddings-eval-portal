Coffee prices resume climb , drinkers seen paying up . Coffee prices resumed their climb on Friday , raising prospects of dearer cups of coffee as European roasters hiked retail prices to make up for soaring bean costs . Bean prices are already up by 32 percent since the start of the New Year and traders said the market looked poised for further gains after recent consolidation . London March robusta coffee futures prices surged to a high of $ 1 , 628 a tonne on Friday , just short of five - month peaks of $ 1 , 630 set on January 23 , on fresh investor short - covering . But the contract ' s rally was shortlived , falling back to $ 1 , 540 by the close for a $ 14 loss . Traders however said the short - term uptrend remained intact . Fundamentally , the market remained firm boosted by worries of lower central American supplies and amid forecasts of lower 1997 / 98 Brazilian harvest . Coffee stocks in both producing and origin countries are also low . Western manufacturers had been running down on stocks since the Brazilian frosts in 1994 pushed prices to 10 - year highs . Coffee drinkers will now have to pay for roasters ' stock - keeping policy . Roasters , caught by the sudden hike in bean prices , scrambled to rebuild their supplies . But with the 32 percent hike in raw material costs , many would have no choice but to pass some of the costs to consumers . Large German roaster Kraft Jacobs Suchard is the latest firm to announce a retail price hike , announcing on Friday that it would have to offset the surge in futures prices and the dollar . Dutch roaster Douwe Egberts also toook a similar action earlier this week but Nestle UK , part of the Swiss food conglomerate , reiterated on Friday it had no immediate plans to raise retail prices but was watching the situation very closely . Despite the hike in bean prices , major producers said they would not like to see prices rising to levels that would deter consumer demand . The head of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries Rubens Barbosa said that the group would like to maintain a policy of stabilising prices at renumerative levels . " As far as the ACPC is concerned we are not looking for sky - high prices , " Barbosa said . " It is neither in the interest of the consumers nor the producers to have boom and bust cycles agains , " he told Reuters in an interview . ACPC countries agreed additional cuts in exports of robusta and arabica coffee totalling 1 . 3 million bags in the first six months of 1997 , aiming to narrow the premium of New York - traded arabica over London ' s robusta . Barbosa denied comments that ACPC ' s export retention programme may have backfired , threatening consumer demand , saying the price spike was a result of changes in fundamental conditions . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4985

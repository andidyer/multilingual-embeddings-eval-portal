On May 27 , the central bank eliminated its fluctuation band within which it would fix the crown up to plus / minus 7 . 5 percent of a mark / dollar basket , and now uses the fixing only as a daily reference point reflecting the market . The fluctuation band was dropped after the central bank was forced to intervene on numerous occasions in recent weeks to defend the crown which had been under heavy downward pressure . - - Prague Newsroom , 420 - 2 - 2423 - 0003

SOCCER - BRAZIL RETAIN FLAVIO AGAINST ENGLAND . Brazil will face England with the 11 men who finished the memorable 3 - 3 draw with Italy when they play their final Tournoi de France match on Tuesday . Coach Mario Zagallo said on Monday he would retain Flavio Conceicao , who came on in the second half in Lyon on Sunday , as a replacement for his Deportivo Coruna team mate Mauro Silva who has picked up two yellow cards in the tournament . Flavio actually stepped into the more advanced midfield role of Dunga with the captain dropping back in front of the back four when Zagallo took off Mauro Silva shortly after he was booked against the Italians . Zagallo said at the end of a light training session at the Parc des Princes , venue for Tuesday ' s match with tournament winners England , that he would also make a change or two in the second half . England won France ' s World Cup dress rehearsal tournament as a result of the draw in Lyon after they had beaten the hosts 1 - 0 in Montpellier on Saturday . The Brazilians fly to South America on Tuesday night , immediately after the match , to take part in the Copa America in Bolivia starting on Wednesday . Brazil play their first match on Friday . Zagallo said the tournament has been extremely valuable for assessing the state of the world champions one year before they defend their title in France . He is more concerned about a defence that has conceded eight goals in their last three games than an attack that scored two fine goals as Brazil came from 3 - 1 down to draw with Italy in their rematch of the 1994 World Cup final . " It ' s not normal to concede so many goals . We ' re looking for better co - ordination . It ' s the result of a lack of attention by one or another player , " Zagallo said . " I ' m looking for a compactness and defensive block that France , England and Italy already have . In the second half we had an offensive compactness against Italy , " he said . " Our goals were much more worked out than Italy ' s , " Zagallo said , comparing the second - half strikes of Ronaldo and Romario with the defensive mistakes that brought Italy ' s second and third goals , a deflected free kick and a penalty . " We had much more difficulty of penetration in the defensive sector than they did , " he said referring to the gaps in the Brazilian rearguard which Italy profited from . " Against France we had defensive compactness in the first half , " added Zagallo , whose team drew 1 - 1 with the hosts five days after falling to a shock 4 - 2 defeat to Norway in Oslo in a friendly .

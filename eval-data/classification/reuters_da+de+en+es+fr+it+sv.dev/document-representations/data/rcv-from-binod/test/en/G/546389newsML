Blasts prompt fears Chechnya tension may escalate . Two fatal bomb blasts and a skirmish on the border of Russia ' s rebel Chechnya republic have raised fears that tensions could boil over again , less than a year after Moscow signed a peace deal with the separatists . " The situation in the north Caucasus is becoming extremely tense . I am afraid it could become uncontrollable , Chechen pogroms may start , " Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said on Tuesday . The violence , in which at least four people were killed and more than 20 injured in less than a week , broke out amid difficult talks on a long - term settlement of a 21 - month conflict between Russian troops and Chechen rebels . In a by - now familiar formula , Moscow alleged that Chechen separatists had launched the latest attacks and the Chechen leadership retorted that it was the work of Russian security services trying to discredit them . Russian defence analyst Pavel Felgengauer said the situation was extremely delicate . " It ' s not just fragile - - there ' s a big fat possibility of escalation , " he told Reuters . He and other analysts said the Kremlin was unlikely to send troops back into Chechnya after being so thoroughly humiliated by the rebels during its disastrous military campaign . But they said there were some in Moscow who were considering trying to seal off Chechnya and who , if the Chechens fought back , could press for air strikes . " The problem is , the real problems were not settled , " Felgengauer said . The last soldiers pulled out in January but the peace talks are hamstrung over the very row which caused the conflict in the first place - - Chechnya ' s insistence on independence and Moscow ' s flat refusal to grant it . The Chechens have found their military victory soured by the fact that their region is in tatters and trade is restricted by Russian officials wary of terrorist attacks , leaving crime virtually the only means to make money . Chechnya ' s leaders desperately need funds to rebuild homes and create jobs but Moscow says it will pay up only if they agree to remain in Russia . Russian officials said an unknown number of people had been killed when police guarding the borders of Chechnya clashed with 20 fighters who crossed into the southern region of Dagestan on Monday night . Defence analyst Dimitry Trenin said the clash may have resulted not from a military incursion but from Chechens trying to steal cattle from Dagestani farms . But he said it was impossible to be sure who was behind the two blasts at railway stations in southern Russia in which four people were killed . " I don ' t think Russia wants to restart the war , but some people may be willing to put pressure on Chechnya , just as there may be some in Chechnya wanting to pressurise Russia , " said Trenin , of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think - tank . Negotiators on both sides agreed on Tuesday that the violence should not be allowed to affect their talks , but splits were visible both in Moscow and the Chechen capital Grozny , ruined in the fighting which took tens of thousands of lives . Both Kulikov , who commanded Russia ' s forces in Chechnya until he became interior minister in July 1995 , and the Chechen leadership said the attacks showed the other side could not control the situation . The deputy Secretary of Russia ' s Security Council Boris Berezovsky , in remarks which could apply as much to Kulikov as to the Chechens , criticised what he said were " hasty statements ( which ) could destroy the negotiating process " . " Today people who have apparently not had enough of fighting in Chechnya are coming out with irresponsible announcements , " he told Interfax news agency , adding that there should be a meeting between influential people in Moscow and the Chechnya soon . Analysts agreed urgent and decisive steps were needed . " The momentum for a treaty between Russia and Chechnya is slipping away , " said Trenin .

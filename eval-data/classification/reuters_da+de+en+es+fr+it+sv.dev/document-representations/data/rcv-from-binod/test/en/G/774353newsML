MOTORCYCLING - DOOHAN WINS SEVENTH RACE IN A ROW . Australia ' s Michael Doohan won his sevnth race in a row and left himself on the verge of his fourth succesive 500cc world motorcyling title at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday . The apparently unstoppable Australian led from the first lap , although he was pushed hard all the way by his Honda team mate Tadayuki Okada of Japan . Italy ' s Luca Cadalora , riding a Yamaha , finished third as he headed a pack of riders that also included Nobuatsu Aoki and Norick Abe of Japan and German Jurgen Fuchs . The only surprise was the fact that Okada , who received his trophy from Brazilian soccer star Romario , made Doohan work so hard for his ninth win in 10 races this season . After the pair had broken away from the pack in the opening laps , Okada remained stuck on Doohan ' s tail throughout the race and made several attempts to pass . However , on a track where a narrow riding line made overtaking difficult , he was foiled each time by the 32 - year - old Australian . " He rode a good race but he wasn ' t able to pass me , " said Doohan . The champion complained that the race , held on a hot , dry day at 11 o ' clock in the morning , began at a diffent time of day to the practices on Friday and Saturday . " We didn ' t have any qualifying at 11 o ' clock in the morning so we didn ' t have any idea what the ground temperature would be . Tyres are very sensitive to ground temperature and choosing them was a real gamble for everyone . " Okada said : " I think my front tyre was a little better than Michael ' s because the front of my machine did not seems to be sliding as much as his . " Okada ' s second place took him above compatriot Aoki into second place in the championship . However , Doohan ' s lead is a massive 116 points with just five races left and the Australian seems set to wrap up the title , possibly at the British Grand Prix later this month . Doohan could have settled matters on Sunday if Okada and Aoki , who finished fourth , had ended in lower positions . Spain ' s Carlos Checa , who briefly led for the first half of the first lap , crashed out in spectacular style in the second lap after clipping Abe ' s back wheel but walked away unscathed . " I made a mistake , " he said . " I saw that Doohan and Okada were opening a gap and I tried to catch up too early . " Brazil ' s Alex Barros had a miserable day in front of his home fans , coming off his bike on the last lap when he was in ninth place . Italian Max Biaggi lost his lead in the 250cc championship , the only category in which the title is being tightly contested , after slipping off the track in the last lap as he tried to overtake Japan ' s Tohru Ukawa . Biaggi , third at the time , managed to complete the race in fifth place but the two dropped places meant he was overtaken in the overall standings by Japan ' s Tetsuya Harada . " I tried to brake late but a bump in the track forced me off , " said Biaggi . Harada , riding an Aprilia , finished second behind Frenchman Olivier Jacque on a Honda , enough to take him two points ahead of Biaggi . A thrilling tussle between the pair ended with Jacque pipping Harada on the last lap . Italy ' s Valentino Rossi , who has emulated Doohan by turning the 125cc category in a one - man race , overtook Japan ' s Noboru Ueda on the last bend to claim his eighth win of the season . He extended his championship lead over Ueda to 77 points with five races left .

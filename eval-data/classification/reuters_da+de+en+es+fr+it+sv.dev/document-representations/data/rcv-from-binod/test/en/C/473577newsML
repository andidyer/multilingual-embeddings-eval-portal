Hollinger sells 5pct Fairfax stake . Conrad Black ' s Hollinger Inc has sold its remaining 4 . 99 percent stake in Australian publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd for A $ 3 . 00 a share , brokers told Reuters on Thursday . Brokers said the transaction of the 37 . 844 million shares was handled by Merrill Lynch ( Australia ) Equities Ltd . The stake sold for about A $ 113 . 5 million . Black agreed last December to sell his 25 percent stake in Fairfax under a deal approved by the Australian government . An initial 20 percent stake was sold to New Zealand ' s Brierley Investments Ltd for A $ 447 . 1 million . Hollinger said at the time that the sale had been prompted by suggestions that the Australian government would not review foreign ownership limits in the media sector . Brierley Investments later sought shareholder approval to lift its stake to 25 percent without making a full takeover bid , but was rebuffed by shareholders last month . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

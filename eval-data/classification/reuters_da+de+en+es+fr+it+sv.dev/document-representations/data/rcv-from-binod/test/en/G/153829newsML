Vatican says Zairean archbishop killed in fighting . Roman Catholic archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa Mwene Ngabo of Bukavu has been killed in a military attack on the eastern Zairean city , the Vatican said on Wednesday . " Monsignor Christophe Munzihirwa died yesterday afternoon during a military attack on the city . We still don ' t know all the details of what happened , " Father Ciro Benedettini , the deputy Vatican spokesman , told Reuters . Church sources in Rome said they believed that Munzihirwa , a Zairean Jesuit , had been killed in an ambush . Bukavu , the capital of Zaire ' s South Kivu province , has been under attack from ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels and Zairean troops have been on a looting spree in recent days . On Wednesday evening it was not clear who was in charge of Bukavu , Zairean troops or rebels . The news of Munzihirwa ' s death came only hours after Pope John Paul had made an impassioned plea for the world to help end the " interminable tragedy " of Central Africa . " With unspeakable sorrow , I am following events in north - eastern Zaire , where ferocious fighting and looting has forced thousands of Rwandan and Burundian refugees , especially the elderly , women and children , into an aimless flight , " he told pilgrims in St Peter ' s Square . " It is agonising to see how human beings , who are sons of God and brothers of ours , are being treated . " Munzihirwa was the fifth senior Catholic figure in two years - - and the second in just over a month - - to be killed in the fighting that has gripped the region . Vincent Nsengiyumva , the archbishop of the Rwandan capital Kigali , was killed by soldiers on June 7 , 1994 along with the bishop of Byumba , Joseph Ruzindana , and the president of the Rwandan episcopal conference , Thadee Nsengiyumva . Last month , the Tutsi archbishop of Burundi Joachim Ruhuna was killed in an ambush . The Pope later condemned the killing as " the latest link in a chain of unheard of violence . " " I sincerely hope the international community will do all in its power to bring help effectively to the catastrophe which is raging , " the Pope said on Wednesday . " It is anguishing to see how human beings who are children of God and who are our brothers are being treated . The Lord will call everyone to account , " said the 76 - year - old Pope who has visited all the countries involved in the crisis . The conflict has already forced half a million refugees to flee camps . More than 150 , 000 people have been killed in three years of massacres and civil war between the army and rebels in Burundi , the southern neighbour of Rwanda where one million people , mostly Tutsis , were slaughtered in ethnic bloodshed in 1994 . " I pray for guns to be silenced , for hatred and ethnic rivalries to be placated and that an end to be put to the shameful manhunt that is taking the place of negotiations , " the Pope said . Zaire has warned Rwanda it would fight to defend its territory and its vast mineral wealth against its neighbour . Rwanda ' s military strongman replied by threatening to retaliate against the Zairean shelling which he said had killed many people in the Rwandan border town of Cyangugu .

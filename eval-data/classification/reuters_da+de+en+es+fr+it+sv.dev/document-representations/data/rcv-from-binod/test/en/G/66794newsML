Yugoslav opposition leader convicted of libel . A Yugoslav opposition leader was given a suspended four - month jail sentence on Friday after a court found him guilty of libel over allegations he made against Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic . Zoran Djindjic , leader of the opposition Democratic Party , made allegations against Marjanovic involving a wheat and gas deal with Russia in a paid advertisement run in the Belgrade weekly Telegraf last January . Belgrade district court sentenced him to four months ' jail , suspended for two years . It cleared the newspaper of any wrongdoing . The court gave Djindjic 15 days in which to lodge an appeal . His defence lawyer told reporters he would appeal , though Djindjic himself told Reuters he was not sure whether he would . His laywer described the sentence as lenient , saying his client could have faced up to three years in jail under Yugoslav law . Djindjic argued he had not intended to belittle Marjanovic but to warn the public about alleged abuses of power . The Serbian government rallied to the prime minister ' s defence , saying all his dealings were in keeping with the law . Djindjic called the decision politically motivated but said it would not stop him speaking out over what he regarded as government abuses of power . He told a news conference after the ruling that he was grateful to the public prosecutor for bringing the trial since it had given the public an opportunity to see how the government operated " and see for themselves the extent of the despair that these authorities have brought us to " . Djindic described the court ' s ruling as a compromise " to the extent that a naive part of the public will believe the honour of Mirko Marjanovic has been saved while international public opinion will not be upset because members of the opposition are not being arrested " .

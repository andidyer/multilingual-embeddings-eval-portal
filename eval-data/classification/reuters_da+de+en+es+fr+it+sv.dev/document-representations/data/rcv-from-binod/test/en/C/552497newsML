RESEARCH ALERT - Ramayana rated a " buy " . Brokerage joint - venture firm Societe Generale Crosby Securities rated retailer PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa a " buy " due to sound fundamentals . " Ramayana ' s fundamentals are as sound as ever and investors should use the recent price weakness to accumulate , " Crosby said . Socgen Crosby said in its latest report that the firm ' s 1996 net profit of 82 billion rupiah was higher than its estimation of 80 billion rupiah . Crosby expected the firm to book a net profit of 105 billion rupiah and 135 billion rupiah for 1997 and 1998 respectively . The report said that in the first quarter of 1997 , Ramayana had already achieved 31 percent of a full year ' s sales which was in line with past 31 - 32 percent trends . " We see no downside risk to our profit after tax forecast of 105 billion rupiah , and may in fact raise the numbers marginally , based on detailed 1996 results , " Crosby said in the report . Crosby said that with long - term earnings sustainable at 25 to 30 percent growth , a solid debt - free balance sheet and 21 percent return on equity , Ramayana deserves a 25 to 30 percent premium to the market . The report said that rumours about Ramayana ' s sales being hurt by retailer Matahari ' s promotion campaigns were untrue because only seven of its 56 stores were in the same location as its rival , making the impact marginal . Crosby said the Indonesian retail sector was in its infancy and Ramayana faced little organised competition in its target segment - - the lower middle class . - - Jakarta newsroom + 6221 384 - 6364

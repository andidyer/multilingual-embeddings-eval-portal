SOCCER - DUMITRESCU STAYING AT WEST HAM SAYS ANGRY REDKNAPP . West Ham manager Harry Redknapp angrily denied reports on Friday that Romanian Ilie Dumitrescu is leaving the English premier league club because of a poor attitude . Redknapp insisted : " That is so far from the truth it is scandalous . I think he is a top - class person and he certainly has not got a bad attitude . " He is a good pro and works his socks off . You don ' t play that many internationals without being a class player . " Redknapp originally signed Dumitrescu from Tottenham last Janaury for 1 . 5 million pounds ( $ 2 . 39 million ) , but he could not play him until March because of work permit complications . Since then Dumitrescu has only made 10 appearances for West Ham , five of those as substitute , and has actually only played one full match for the club - - a league cup tie against third division Barnet . He was left out of the 14 involved in the League cup win over Nottingham Forest on Wednesday but Redknapp explained : " I need him to get fit and over his hamstring injury completely . " Dumitrescu will be restored to the bench for Saturday ' s league clash with Blackburn along with West Ham ' s other Romanian international Florin Raducioiu , now fit again after injury .

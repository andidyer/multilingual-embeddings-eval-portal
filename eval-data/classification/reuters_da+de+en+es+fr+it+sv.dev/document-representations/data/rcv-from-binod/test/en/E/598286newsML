U . S . Fed leaves interest rates unchanged . The U . S . Federal Reserve opted on Tuesday to hold interest rates steady at a closely - watched meeting of its policy - making committee . The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee left the federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans at 5 . 50 percent and the discount rate that the Fed charges the banks for money at 5 . 0 percent . " Should the expected slowing in the growth of demand fail to materialize , we would need to address any emerging pressures in product and credit markets , " Greenspan said . The economy grew at its fastest rate in more than nine years in the first quarter , expanding at a 5 . 6 percent annualized clip , fueled by a consumer spending boom . But growth looks set to slow sharply in the second quarter , to perhaps half the pace of the first three months of the year , economists said . Retail stores saw their sales slump in April while production at the nation ' s factories was flat . At the same time , inflation has remained quiescent . Consumer prices rose a mere 0 . 1 percent in April from the previous month , for a year - on - year increase of 2 . 5 percent . But there are doubts about how long that combination of moderate growth and tepid inflation will last , analysts said . Jobs are plentiful and consumers are confident , pointing to the possibility of a pick - up in growth later this year . At 4 . 9 percent , the unemployment rate stands at its lowest point in nearly 24 years and is at a level that in the past has led to stepped - up wage demands and higher inflation . In his speech at New York University earlier this month , Greenspan said the central bank needed to be wary . " While there is scant evidence of any imminent resurgence of inflation at the moment , there also appears to be little slack in our capacity to produce , " he said . The Fed holds its next policy - making meeting on July 1 - 2 . At its meeting in March , the central bank tightened credit for the first time in more than two years , bumping up the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point . Greenspan has defended that move as a small step to stay ahead of inflation and has likened it to taking a vaccination to guard against the risk of getting a serious disease . But he has also acknowledged that the increase generated more than the usual amount of criticism . " They ' re sensitive to the political pressure , " Gary Thayer , senior economist at St . Louis - based brokers A . G Edwards and Sons , said . " The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 12 : 45 p . m . ( 1645 GMT ) , " central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said . " There is no further announcement . " The Fed ' s decision to leave interest rates unchanged was welcome news for many lawmakers , businessmen and labour unions who sharply criticised the inflation - wary central bank for tightening credit in March . Wall Street analysts had been deeply divided over whether the Fed would raise rates , with a slim majority polled by Reuters ahead of Tuesday ' s meeting expecting it to leave them unchanged . In a speech in New York earlier this month , central bank Chairman Alan Greenspan forecast that economic growth would slow and inflation would stay stable in the months ahead . But he warned that the central bank was ready to raise interest rates if that did not prove to be the case .

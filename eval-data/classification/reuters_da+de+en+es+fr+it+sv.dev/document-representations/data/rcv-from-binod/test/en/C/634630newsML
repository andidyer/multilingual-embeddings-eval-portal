" Consumer spending and personal income are leveling off and we ' re seeing signs of a second - quarter pause in the economy , " Yale Gieszl , president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc . , said in a statement .

He said GM ' s car sales results were probably affected by the Oklahoma strike more than anticipated , and added that truck sales were helped by strong inventories and incentive spending , particularly on sport utility vehicles . " Some of the money they ' re throwing at the trucks has been moving the metal a bit , " he said . GM also had some help on the truck side from its trio of all - new minivans , which tallied sales of 15 , 484 units , up 138 percent from year - ago sales of predecessor models . GM ' s Chevrolet division posted its best May truck sales ever , with 143 , 884 units topping the May 1996 record of 140 , 216 .

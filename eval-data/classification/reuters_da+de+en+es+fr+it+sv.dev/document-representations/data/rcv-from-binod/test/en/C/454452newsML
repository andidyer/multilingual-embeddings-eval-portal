FOCUS - C & W reported to be eyeing Sprint . Britain ' s Cable and Wireless Plc was reported on Wednesday to be mulling a bid for Sprint Corp of the U . S . in a move that would create one of the world ' s largest telecom companies . The Wall Street Journal reported that C & W had held talks with Sprint shareholder France Telecom on a possible C & W bid for Sprint that could be worth more than $ 15 billion . The report , citing people familiar with the talks , said the bid would be for the 80 percent of Sprint that was not already owned by France Telecom and Germany ' s Deutsche Telekom AG , each of which own 10 percent of Sprint . A C & W spokeswoman declined to comment on the report . Separately , France Telecom denied that it had held talks with C & W about raising its holding in Sprint . " I deny that we had talks with Cable & Wireless about increasing our stake in Sprint . We are very happy with the 20 percent we own in Sprint with Deutsche Telekom , " the France Telecom spokesman said . The spokesman added that France Telecom had held talks with C & W regarding Global One , the French firm ' s alliance with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint . C & W ' s shares firmed 2 . 0 pence to 508 by 0940 GMT as some traders said a bid for Sprint would make sense after rival British Telecommunications Plc ' s planned $ 20 billion merger with MCI Communications Corp . " If ( C & W ) are going to compete in a global market , they have to find a partner , " the head of trading at a large brokerage said . The newspaper report said C & W had yet to make a formal offer to Sprint and noted that many financial , managerial and regulatory details would have to be worked out before an approach could be made . A link - up between C & W and Sprint would create the world ' s 15th largest telecoms group in terms of market capitalisation , according to Reuters Securities 3000 . Sprint ' s current market capitalisation was about $ 14 . 5 billion , while C & W was valued at $ 11 . 3 billion . By comparison , Concert , the proposed merger between BT and MCI , would create the world ' s second largest telecommunications company with a combined capitalisation of $ 66 . 89 billion . C & W remains one of the few major international telecoms players that can boast access to lucrative Asian markets via its majority stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .

Havel tells Herzog east bloc has to join EU . The presidents of the Czech Republic and Germany stressed the importance to former east bloc countries of joining the European Union on Thursday and said the Union would not be complete until this happened . " The countries of Central Europe in no case want to become a separate political grouping between East and West , but want to belong to the West , " Czech President Vaclav Havel said at the Berlin state parliament . Havel was in Berlin on a one - day working visit and observed a discussion with German President Roman Herzog and 12 dissidents , six from the Czech Republic and six from the former east Germany . Before the panel discussion Havel joined in from the audience with Czech dissidents who sang old Cold War - era songs . Herzog said the EU would not be complete until the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland became members and said its survival depended on the enlargement . " Enlargement of the EU is imperative so Europe speaks with one voice on the fundamental questions of future world politics , " said Herzog . Earlier in a speech at Bellevue Castle in Berlin , Herzog praised Havel as a fearless opponent of communist despotism and said his courage gave others the strength to fight oppression . The 60 - year - old former poet Havel was jailed for almost five years in the former communist - led Czechoslovakia . " Czechs and Germans share responsibility for learning the lessons of dictatorship and making sure the horrors of the past are not forgotten . Forgetting leads to the danger of new errors and crimes , " Herzog said . " Only by remembering can we pass on the truth ( to future generations ) . . . only by discovering the truth do we do justice to the victims . " East German pro - democracy activists presented a smiling Havel with a large white banner that had been waved at two large anti - government rallies in 1989 in East Germany which read : " Freedom for Vaclav Havel and for all political and religious prisoners in Czechoslovakia .

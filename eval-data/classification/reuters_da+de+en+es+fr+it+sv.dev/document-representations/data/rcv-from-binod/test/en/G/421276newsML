German nuclear waste convoy arrives at dump . A controversial nuclear waste shipment on Wednesday completed the last leg of its journey to a dump in northern Germany , greeted by boos and whistles from a crowd of anti - nuclear activists . A convoy of six flat - bed trucks carrying containers of spent fuel rods arrived at Gorleben storage depot under heavy police escort after protesters tried to disrupt its 20 - km ( 16 - mile ) journey from a loading station in Dannenberg . What should have been a relatively short journey took three hours as some 5 , 000 demonstrators posted along roads leading to the dump did their best to block the way . It took Germany ' s biggest post - war security operation , involving 30 , 000 police nationwide to ensure that the radioactive shipment completed its journey across the country and arrived safely at the dump . Each phase of the journey was hindered by protesters pressing demands for a nuclear - free Germany . The operation was estimated to cost at least 66 million marks ( $ 39 million ) and surpass the 46 million marks spent on bringing a smaller shipment to Gorleben last year . The waste from two German power stations and a French reprocessing plant was transported by train from the southern town of Walheim early on Monday and was unloaded on to trucks in the northern town of Dannenberg on Tuesday . Along the route from there to Gorleben , militant demonstrators fired flare pistols and pelted riot police with stones . Police retaliated by turning water cannon on the protesters . Border guards in helicopters hovered over the area . Explosives experts were called to a spot where an anonymous caller said a bomb had been planted . It was not yet clear whether the object was an explosive device or a dummy . Earlier , police turned water cannon from three trucks on hundreds of protesters for three hours to clear them from the gates of the loading station in Dannenberg . They warned the activists by loudspeaker the drenching would continue unless they stopped their sit - down blockade . Activists have already tried to make roads to Gorleben unusable by damaging the surface of some , tunnelling underneath others . Local farmers set up barricades with tractors and haystacks . On Tuesday hundreds of masked militants lobbed petrol bombs and pelted police with stones to protest against the shipment . Two police officers were injured in the clashes .

Berlin hands decaying Olympic Stadium to investors . The German government and the city of Berlin said on Friday the Olympic Stadium built by Adolf Hitler ' s Nazis to host the 1936 Olympics would be turned over to private investors for redevelopment . The German Finance Ministry and Berlin ' s city - state government said in a joint statement that the 76 , 000 - seat stadium would be transferred to an investor of their choice prepared to foot the bill for an estimated 660 - million - mark ( $ 382 . 5 - million ) overhaul . The announcement ended four years of wrangling over the future of the stadium and its grounds , notoriously linked to Hitler ' s Third Reich regime and immortalised in German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl ' s 11 - hour epic film of the 1936 games . Berlin government officials said Bonn had originally insisted on a sale price of 160 million marks for the stadium , which is federal government property and protected as a historical monument . But driven by the dire state of both federal and city finances , the Bonn Finance Ministry and Berlin authorities said they would hand it over free of cost . Berlin government sources said there were investors interested in the stadium . " Due to the federal and city authorities ' tight finances the partners in negotiations have agreed that . . . public financing of the Olympic grounds including the stadium is out of the question , " the joint statement said . " The government has declared that the whole property will be placed at the disposal of investors free of cost , " it said . The German government and Berlin city authorities said they would decide by the end of the year on a concept for privatising and modernising the stadium . They would consider whether the project would include building a second stadium on the grounds as well - - which , according to Berlin government officials , could cost another 300 million marks . After World War Two the Allied British military headquarters were located on the ground of the stadium and used it for Queen Elizabeth ' s birthday parade every May , until the Allied powers left Berlin in 1994 following German unification . The stadium has been in regular use since the war as a sports venue . It was also the arena chosen for a mass given by Pope John Paul to some 100 , 000 people during his visit to Berlin last year . And in 1990 , the stadium played host to a Rolling Stones rock concert . ( $ = 1 . 725 German Marks )

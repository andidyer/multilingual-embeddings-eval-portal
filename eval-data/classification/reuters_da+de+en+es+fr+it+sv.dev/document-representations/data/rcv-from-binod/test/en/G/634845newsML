Sombre mood in bomb - hit Algerian city before poll . In Algeria ' s sunlit capital , few residents filling the crowded pavements on Tuesday cast a glance at the election posters seeking their vote in Thursday ' s parliamentary ballot . A sombre mood of subdued tension , provoked by four deadly bombs in the past three days blamed on Moslem guerrillas , seems to dominate this city of three to four million people . The bombs , which killed at least 22 people and wounded more than 120 , have not stopped Algerians from going out . The shops are full of goods though many people are only window - shopping . In the pavement cafes , men sip coffee in the sunshine , their conversation touching on politics but as often focusing on the cost of living . Few of those prepared to speak openly to a stranger about politics see the election ending five years of civil strife - - an avowed aim of President Liamine Zeroual in holding it . " I will vote because it is my right and my chance to say what I think about what is going on around me , " a taxi driver said . " I will not be voting because I think my vote will help bring an end to this madness . It won ' t . " Other residents interviewed by Reuters shared this view . In one reflection of the sour mood , only about 60 people turned up on Monday night to attend a concert organised by the National Democratic Rally ( RND ) , the party tipped by many to win most seats in the 380 - member National Assembly . RND , formed in April by Zaroual ' s supporters , cancelled the activity . " You can ' t have a concert while people are still burying their dead , " one resident said , referring to the bomb on Monday in which officials said seven people died . A newspaper on Tuesday said several of the 37 wounded had died and the toll was now 11 dead . But political rallies on Monday did attract thousands of committed supporters of the Islamist - leading Movement of a Peaceful Society , and the anti - Islamist Rally for Culture and Democracy . In the streets , faces of candidates peer down on the city from posters of the 39 competing parties , almost all focusing on peace . Most carry a large picture of the party leader in the centre , with supporting candidates around . Local political analysts said they expected a substantial turnout by voters among the 29 million people but doubted it would equal the 1995 presidential election won by Zeroual . They said people had been disappointed by how little things had changed since . The authorities see Thursday ' s poll as a key step toward ending the crisis sparked in January 1992 when they cancelled elections that radical Islamists were poised to win . About 60 , 000 people have died in the conflict since . With economic hardship often cited as a main reason behind the rise of support for radical Islamists in Algeria in the late 1980s , many people are feeling the pinch of reforms which have brought praise abroad for Algeria ' s macroeconomic status . " Will this election lead to security ? Will it find me a job ? " asked one unemployed 25 - year - old , who did not give his identity . " The bombs and massacres continue and even the candidates of the various parties have not promised to resolve the economic crisis so what can we expect ? "

FedEx has good first year at Subic Bay hub . Federal Express Corporation is celebrating the first anniversary of its Asian hub and company officials say the $ 60 million network centre at Subic Bay in the Philippines is continuing to grow . But FedEx could not say when more direct destinations would be added to its network and declined to give any reason for the delay . This week Hong Kong became the 13th direct destination for FedEx following new services begun two weeks ago from Beijing and Shanghai to Subic Bay . " It has been a very good first year and we are delighted to be here , " John Allison , FedEx Vice President , South Pacific region , told Reuters . Subic Bay , four hours ' drive north of Manila , used to be the Asian home of the U . S . Navy . Five FedEx freighters now operate from the refurbished runway of the former base . FedEx officials said one of its largest customers was the Acer computer factory which was building another factory at Subic . Other computer chip and component assemblers also provided high value business , officials added . The FedEx hub can handle 6 , 000 packages an hour . The U . S . express operator will not release statistics about its first year ' s trade but officials said business was expanding in double - digits and its intra - Asian network was growing faster than its trans - Pacific traffic . A FedEx spokesman added that it might eventually build another Asian hub if the market continued to grow . " The next big step is our around - the - world flights from the USA , through Europe to the Middle East , India and Subic Bay , which will turn around and go back , " Allison said . " We would also anticipate adding additional points in the future and expanding our AsiaTwo network . We don ' t know where , and we don ' t know when yet , but we would hope to add Bangkok and Jakarta . And there could be multiple hubs serving the north and south of Asia . " We have made a substantial investment in Subic Bay and would expect it to be part of the network in the future , but at some point it will reach capacity and there could be well be more hubs opened in Asia as we have done across America , " he said . The current parking space for 12 aircraft could easily be doubled and there was substantial space to expand its logistics service , he said . FedEx employs 320 people at Subic Bay and enjoys a virtual monopoly of the airport . A spokesman for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority said FedEx had been crucial in attracting foreign investment which has totalled $ 1 . 6 billion since the U . S . military pulled out . Exports from Subic had risen from $ 23 million in 1994 to $ 173 million last year and $ 212 million had already been reached this year , with a projected total of more than $ 400 million for the year , he added . - Air Cargo Newsroom tel : + 44 171 542 7706 fax : + 44 171 542 5017

GM Korea exec says no agreement with Ssangyong . Discussions between General Motors Corp and Ssangyong Motor Co are nowhere near the point of public comment , the president of General Motors - Korea told Reuters on Thursday . Alan Perriton said GM had concluded no agreement with Ssangyong and he didn ' t understand why Ssangyong would be making public statements at this stage . He was referring to remarks by a Ssangyong Group executive that discussions were underway with GM and other foreign companies about a $ 300 million capital investment in Ssangyong Motor . " We ' ve had discussions with Ssangyong , but they haven ' t proceeded to any level where we would be making confirmations or issuing statements , " Perriton said . " Ssangyong is just one of the South Korean car companies we ' re having discussions with . " Cho Nam - do , a vice president of the Ssangyong Group , told Reuters earlier on Thursday that no agreements had been concluded and that he was not suggesting that GM would be the largest investor in Ssangyong Motor . Cho said the other foreign companies included several Southeast Asian companies owned and run by ethnic Chinese businessmen . " We are discussing with many foreign companies and General Motors is only one of them , " Cho said . In a front - page story on Thursday , the Korea Economic Daily , a major business newspaper , quoted an unidentified Ssangyong official as saying the company would conclude by June negotiations on the capital investment by GM and others . The paper said the deal with GM was at the centre of Ssangyong ' s plan to reduce its debt - to - equity ratio to about 1 , 000 percent from 10 , 000 percent at the end of 1996 . Ssangyong Motor , which specialises in making four - wheel drive vehicles and trucks , posted a net loss of 228 . 49 billion won in 1996 , compared with the previous year ' s 126 . 23 billion loss .

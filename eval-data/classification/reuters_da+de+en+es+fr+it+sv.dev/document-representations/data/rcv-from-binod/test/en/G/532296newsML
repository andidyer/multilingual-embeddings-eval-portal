U . S . had " some indications " of Peru commando raid . U . S . officials had " some advance indications " that Peruvian troops were about to storm the rebel - held Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima on Tuesday , but insisted on Wednesday they were not officially informed . The State Department also said the United States had given no advice on the raid or provided any training to the military commandos who carried it out , freeing 71 hostages held for four months by Peruvian Marxist guerrillas . " We had some advance indications that something of this nature might occur , " department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . He refused to say what the indications were or how soon in advance the United States had received them . " The important thing is we had no advance warning by the government ( of Peru ) . . . that they were going to do this , " he told reporters . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior U . S . officials found out about the raid from live coverage on CNN television , he added . Burns stressed that the United States had played no role of any kind in the raid , which led to the deaths of 14 guerrillas of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) , two Peruvian soldiers and one hostage . " The Peruvians from day one of the crisis never requested assistance from us on how to handle this , and therefore no assistance was given by the United States , " he said . " Did we provide training for the raid , for the military assault team ? - - no . Did we ever provide training to the military assault team ? - no , " Burns said . Burns and other officials said the United States had in recent years provided crisis response and anti - terrorism training as well as " non - offensive " equipment such as flak jackets and radios to the Peruvian police . But they said Peru ' s police had played no part in the raid itself , only moving in later . The United States sent a contingency team to Lima soon after the residence take - over on Dec . 17 because six Americans were among the 500 or so hostages originally held . The Americans were released soon afterwards and the team returned to Washington in early January . Burns reaffirmed U . S . support for the Peruvian government ' s handling of the crisis , saying it had acted " responsibly " and dismissing as " impossible " the guerrillas ' demands for the release of jailed comrades . He said the United States sympathised with the families of the dead hostage and the dead soldiers . " And our sympathies go out to the families of all killed , " he said in a formulation apparently including the families of the guerrillas . Burns said there was " no indication of specific threats against U . S . citizens " as a result of the drama . He added that Washington expected that there should be no retaliation from the side of Peruvian authorities against New Yorker Lori Berenson , sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru in 1995 for alleged involvement in an MRTA guerrilla plan to take over Congress .

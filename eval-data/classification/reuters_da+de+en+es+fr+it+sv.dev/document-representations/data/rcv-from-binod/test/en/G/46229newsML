China says nuclear test ban pact is welcome move . China on Wednesday welcomed the nuclear test ban treaty passed by the United Nations , and took the rare step of urging worldwide accession to the pact . " This move will surely contribute to the advancement of the nuclear disarmament process , the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation and promotion of international peace and security , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told the official Xinhua news agency . " This undoubtedly conforms to the common interests of the entire international community , " he said . The General Assembly overwhelmingly endorsed the treaty banning nuclear explosions in the atmosphere , underground or in any other environment , in a 158 - to - three vote on Tuesday led by Australia and adamantly opposed by India . Beijing , which usually avoids pressing other countries to take part in international accords , took the rare step of hinting that India should end its opposition . China hoped the treaty would be signed as soon as possible and would be " acceded to and honoured worldwide , " Shen said , in a clear call to India . India has dug in its heels , saying it would hold fast against the accord just as the nation ' s spiritual founder , Mahatma Gandhi , had stood up to British rule . However , Shen repeated a long - held stand by China - - one of the world ' s five declared nuclear powers - - that the treaty was insufficient and that a total world ban on nuclear weapons was necessary . " Of course , the prohibition of nuclear testing is in itself not the ultimate objective , but rather the first step toward the accomplishment of the final goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , " Shen said . " Therefore , in the field of nuclear disarmament , the international community still has an arduous task and a long way to go , " he said , adding that it should strive for a world free of nuclear weapons as soon as possible . Removal of China ' s objections to the treaty had been crucial in reaching the final draft approved at the U . N . Beijing has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts . On July 29 , China conducted what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self - imposed moratorium that took effect the following day . It was the last declared nuclear power after Britain , the United States , Russia and France to announce a halt to testing . Three other non - declared nuclear states are believed to have covert nuclear programmes - - India , Pakistan and Israel . India ' s opposition , based on the treaty ' s failure to set a timetable for eliminating the world ' s atomic arsenals , was a key sticking point for the deal ' s ultimate success and was likely to lead to heavy pressure on New Delhi . The pact , known as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , does not enter into force until 44 countries with nuclear power reactors sign the document and ratify it through their parliaments .

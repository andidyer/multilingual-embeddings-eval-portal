State - owned pension fund Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) holds a 30 percent equity in MISC , the stake said to be targeted by Mirzan . An official at MISC said he was unaware of the rumour and declined to comment on it . EPF officials could not be immediately reached for comment . - - Kuala Lumpur newsroom ( 603 - 201 4813 )

Council agrees voice telephone , licensing directives . The Telecommunications Council agreed on Thursday a cornerstone of its plan for liberalising telecoms markets by January 1 , 1998 - - new rules to cover basic voice telephone service . It also formally adopted legislation setting out a regime for authorising phone companies to operate in an era of free competition . " These two directives are really the centrepiece of what has to be in place by 1998 for competition to be able to function , " Telecommunications Commissioner Martin Bangemann told a news conference . The ministers reached a political agreement on a common position on the voice telephone measure , COM ( 96 ) 419 , which would update directive 96 / 62 / EC on application of " Open Network Provision " principles to voice telephony . It aims to ensure that consumers or competing companies receive efficient and non - discriminatory service when hooking up to phone networks . It now goes to the European Parliament , which has co - decision powers in this area and is expected to seek some changes . The draft directive covers issues such as network access , contracts , tariffs and billing and sets out a range of services that must be offered to all residents at an affordable price once state monopolies are abolished - - with help from a special " universal service " fund if needed . The services include phone lines that can handle calls , faxes and data communications ; directories , directory services , public pay phones and emergency services . One of the main controversies was whether mobile phone companies should be covered by the new rules , diplomats said . The ministers agreed to require mobile operators to follow only certain provisions - - those covering directory services , operator assistance , emergency services , contracts and publication of consumer information , they said . To take account of the new competitive environment , the legislation would apply some provisions to companies with " significant market share " - - generally at least 25 percent of a country ' s voice phone market - - rather than to those granted " special or exclusive " rights as in the current law . It would require phone companies to offer contracts to all users , to publish information for consumers about terms and conditions and in some cases to meet quality standards . Governments could also require them to provide users on request with tone dialling , itemised billing and the ability to bar certain phone calls . Operators with significant market power would be required to follow certain principles in setting tariffs - - for example , basing them on actual costs and not requiring users to pay for facilities that are not necessary for the service requested . The Council also finalised a directive , COM ( 95 ) 545 , it provisionally agreed in September setting out rules for licensing and authorising new telecoms operators . The text , which will take effect 20 days after it is published in the Official Journal , requires governments to use open and objective procedures and establishes a " one - stop shopping " system for companies wanting to operate in more than one EU state . It encourages them to use " general authorisations " requiring no prior approval but allows individual licences for providers of voice telephone services and public telecoms networks - - or if needed to allocate radio frequencies or numbers , grant access to land or impose public service obligations . Germany raised a last - minute objection to a provision on licence fees , arguing that they should be based on the value of the licence rather than only on administrative costs . Other ministers argued that it was too late to alter the text , already agreed with the parliament under co - decision procedures . However , the Commission issued a statement saying the fees could include both costs incurred at the time the licence was issued and those incurred in managing , controlling and enforcing the licence . The ministers also formally adopted a decision , COM ( 95 ) 529 , providing for more EU coordination in regulating satellite personal communications services .

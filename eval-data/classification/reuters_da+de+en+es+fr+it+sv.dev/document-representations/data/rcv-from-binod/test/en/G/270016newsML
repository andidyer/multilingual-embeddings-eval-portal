Clinton reads Christmas poem to children . President Clinton took time out of his schedule Friday to read a traditional Christmas poem to children amid festive holiday decorations in the White House East Room . Seated on a bench with his wife Hillary and surrounded by a group of 5 - to 10 - year - old children from area schools , Clinton revelled in his annual duty of reading the poem about jolly old St . Nick , " T ' was the Night Before Christmas . " One wide - eyed little boy told the president after the reading : " I saw you on TV . " Clinton laughed and said : " I ' d be in big trouble if you never saw me on TV . " As much as the children were excited at being with the Clintons , they were even more delighted when the Clintons ' cat , Socks , was brought in for some petting .

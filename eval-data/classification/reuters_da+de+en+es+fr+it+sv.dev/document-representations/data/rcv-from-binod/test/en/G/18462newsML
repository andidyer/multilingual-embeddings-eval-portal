BASEBALL - COURT SAYS SATIRIC BASEBALL CARDS ARE OKAY . A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a Tulsa , Oklahoma , company could produce trading cards satirising major league baseball players and their big money contracts . The ruling by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals followed an attempt by the Major League Baseball Players Association to stop Cardtoons L . C . from marketing the cards on grounds they violated the players ' publicity and licensing rights . One of the cards showed a likeness of San Francisco Giants outfielder Bobby Bonds , one of baseball ' s highest paid players , and identified him as " Treasury Bonds . " He is shown tipping a batboy for bringing him a golden bat labeled a " Fort Knoxville Slugger . " The court said the cards were protected by the First Amendment and the right to free speech . " The cards . . . are an important form of entertainment and social commentary that deserve First Amendment protection , " it said . " The irony of MLBPA ' s counter - claim for profits from the cards is not lost on this panel ( of judges ) , " the court said .

Internet offers huge opportunity for sports betting . The Internet , the vast international computer network where thousands of World Wide Web sites already offer consumers a host of information and shopping services , is also a huge growth area for betting on sporting events , a Las Vegas betting executive said on Wednesday . Michael Roxborough , president of Las Vegas Sports Consultants , told the Interactive Sports Europe conference that there is huge demand for interactive gambling on the Internet , particularly from consumers in countries where betting on sports is banned . " You cannot bet legally ( on sports ) in the U . S . , except in Nevada , and there is no legalised betting in Asia , so the Internet provides people with a way of doing it , " Roxborough said . Although legalised gambling is widespread in the U . S . , betting on sporting events other than horse racing is prohibited , except in Nevada . By contrast , betting on sporting events is widespread in Britain . But Roxborough said that even in markets where sports betting is widespread , the Internet offers a marketing opportunity . " In markets where gambling is legal , the Internet allows consumers to gamble while a game or race is in progress - - which is not allowed via traditional betting shops , " he said . A search on the Internet by Reuters found 28 companies offering sports betting via the Internet , with providers ranging from some of the major British operators of betting shops - - such as Ladbroke and William Hill - - to offerings from Australia , Canada , Germany and Iceland . Consumers betting via the Internet place bets with a credit card , but Roxborough said security is not a concern . " It ' s not an issue for them , they couldn ' t care less about security , " he said . " They just want to place bets . " Roxborough , however , warned that players should beware because there is no guarantee that Internet bookmakers will pay up on winning bets . " Governments are not interested in helping the consumer on this one , " he said . " Most people that play choose a company that has been established a while and is more likely to pay up . " Consumers are sent winnings by direct bank transfer or by cheque , although Roxborough said some consumers plough their winnings into an account with the bookmaker and use it to continue making bets .

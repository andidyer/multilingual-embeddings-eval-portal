Peru president Fujimori rests after oral surgery . Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was resting on Monday after undergoing minor surgery to his mouth at Lima ' s top cancer hospital . " He is taking it easy this morning . He does not have anything in his agenda , " a Government Palace official told Reuters . The 58 - year - old president spent nine hours on Sunday in Lima ' s National Institute of Neoplastic Illnesses , which specialises in operations to treat or prevent cancer . Government Palace officials said the operation was " satisfactory " but would not give further details . Leading local newspaper El Comercio reported on Monday that Fujimori had been treated for " a small , benign lesion in his vocal cords . " Hospital officials said they were still waiting for the president ' s biopsy results , and would not give more information . Fujimori , who shows boundless energy in his frequent tours of the provinces and Lima shantytowns , has had a gruelling last five months handling Peru ' s hostage crisis and its aftermath . But last week he obtained permission from Congress for a personal visit to the United States between Thursday and next Tuesday when he is due to visit his children studying abroad . Local media have speculated the visit may also be for medical reasons . Fujimori ' s former wife Susana Higuchi told local newspaper Sintesis , however , that the president had no serious illness that she knew about .

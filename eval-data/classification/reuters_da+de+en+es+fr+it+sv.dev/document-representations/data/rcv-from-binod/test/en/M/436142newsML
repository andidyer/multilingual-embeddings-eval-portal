" The market turned around from early losses " on the news , one trader said . But a decline in U . S . Treasuries outweighed the S & P news , pulling the market lower again late in the session . The dollar - denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $ 0 . 15 to 126 . 35 , while Argentina ' s FRB Brady bond due 2005 fell 1 / 8 to 90 . Traders agreed that if indeed S & P does upgrade the rating or the outlook , it would boost Argentine bonds .

" I do not think it will be enough to change the nervous trend , " said another trader . And as players await word on the rating expected in two or three weeks , the focus was set to turn back to the U . S . with key economic indicators due for release in coming days . Call money rates were flat at 6 . 13 percent . ( ( - - Axel Bugge , Buenos Aires Newsroom , 541 318 - 0668 ) )

Oil prices hit six - month low as U . S . stocks rise . World oil prices fell to their lowest for six months on Thursday after data showed crude stocks rising in the United States , the world ' s largest energy market , traders said . Benchmark Brent April crude futures closed in London at $ 20 . 07 a barrel , 56 cents down on the day and three cents below a previous six - month low set on Tuesday . Thursday ' s price is the lowest the Brent front month contract has traded since August 28 , when it touched a low of $ 19 . 95 . American Petroleum Institute stock figures released after the market closed on Wednesday showed U . S . crude oil inventories rose by 3 . 12 million barrels last week - - a rise some had expected in view of maintenance work at U . S . refineries . But stock data from the U . S . Department of Energy ' s Energy Information Administration added to bearish sentiment by showing crude stocks grew 4 . 4 million barrels , when traders were expecting a build of 3 . 275 million barrels . " It is clear now that the tight fundamentals seen in all three major product markets during the fall is dissipating fast , " Washington - based Petroleum Finance Company said in a market commentary , referring to the European , Pacific and Atlantic Basin markets . " Global demand for crude has already begun to weaken in the Atlantic Basin with the start of the refinery maintenance season in the United States " and poor financial returns from refining , it added . Demand for heating oil , which provided support for higher prices earlier this year , has fallen steadily in the last few weeks as supplies were replenished and the weather became milder . But some brokers drew encouragement from declines in U . S . product supplies , particularly gasoline , ahead of the driving season , and bullish short - term technicals . Gasoline stocks fell by 1 . 3 million barrels and distillates by 2 . 9 million , the API said . Prices had made up some ground on Wednesday , with dealers saying the limited recovery was hardly surprising given the 15 percent decline in prices since the end of January .

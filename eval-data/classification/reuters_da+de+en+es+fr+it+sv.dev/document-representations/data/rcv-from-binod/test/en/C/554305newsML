Lufthansa names Skynet as UK Flash partner . Lufthansa Cargo AG ( LCAG ) said it has appointed UK - based independent international express freight company Skynet as its main ' Flash ' express delivery service partner within Britain . LCAG , the autonomous cargo unit of Deutsche Lufthansa AG , said the arrangement was the result of a long - standing business relationship between the two companies , which began in 1993 when Skynet was chosen to test Lufthansa Cargo ' s then embryonic Flash service in Europe . Lufthansa Cargo said it now takes care of the airport - to - airport service , while Skynet and its partners carry out airport - to - door deliveries throughout many countries , Flash is Lufthansa ' s guaranteed overnight express delivery service and covers most of the carrier ' s 70 European destinations . A fleet of Boeing 737QCs ( quick - change ) is used , which operate as freighters during the night and passenger aircraft during the daytime . - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44 171 542 7706 Fax : 5017

Worldwide LPG slow before Easter , awaiting April C . The international Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) market was becalmed this week , with little trade in Europe , Asia , or the US as many players said they had closed their positions for March and were not expecting renewed activity until after the Easter long weekend . Propane prices in Europe fell on Wednesday , reflecting losses on crude and naphtha . Deals were reported at $ 183 . 50 and $ 186 a tonne cif NWE for large cargoes , but the market was quiet again by Thursday . Large North Sea producer Statoil was closed on Thursday for the Easter break , and few were expecting much activity on the last day before the long weekend . A trader pointed out that many European dealers had been in Houston last week for the major Purvin & Gertz conference , and then returned for only a week between the conference and Easter . This had had an effect on hampering market activity , he said . And while the propane market in northern Europe was weaker , the Mediterranean market was subdued . A trader for one of the region ' s major sellers said that discussion was quiet and there was " nothing special " driving the market . He estimated the level of large propane cargoes at around $ 210 a tonne cif Lavera , but added that activity had been extremely thin this week . Butane prices in both northwest Europe and the Mediterranean were little changed and business in both centres was illiquid , dealers said . In the Middle East Gulf , propane was slightly weaker while butane was little changed . A spot propane trade was reported at Saudi Contract Price ( CP ) - $ 32 a tonne fob Gulf , while butane was reported done at CP - $ 17 a tonne fob . The new CP for April is expected to be announced on Monday April 1 . Spot trade is frequently slow immediately before a new CP , which is the main pricing benchmark in the Asian market , is announced . East Asian markets were quiet , also slowed down by the expectation of a lower CP next week . In Japan , buyers are slowly building up stock levels , a Japanese trader said , but are holding off the spot market , preferring to build stocks with contract cargoes . " The peak season is November , " the trader said , " so people have another six months or more before deciding to buy . " The CP is expected to fall throughout the summer , making it attractive for buyers in Japan , South Korea , China and other Asian markets to delay as long as possible before picking up supplies on the spot market . This is especially true when there is no urgent need for the supplies and they are being purchased in advance for next winter . In the US , markets were quiet ahead of the long Easter weekend . On Wednesday evening propane prices were steady at between 37 . 50 cents and 38 cents a gallon at Mont Belvieu in Texas , with prices at Conway , Kansas also unchanged . And butane markets were stable in quiet activity , dealers said . The Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) reported on Wednesday evening that US propane stocks were up 800 , 000 barrels in the week ending March 21 to 24 . 1 million barrels , the first time since early February that stocks have risen to within the normal range . - - Sebastian Alison , London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 6412 ( c ) Reuters Limited 1997

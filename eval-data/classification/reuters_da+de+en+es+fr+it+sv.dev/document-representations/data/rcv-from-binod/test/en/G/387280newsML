ATHLETICS - ROMANIA ' S NEGURA BANNED FOR STEROID USE . Romania ' s European women ' s cross country champion Iulia Negura was banned for two years on Wednesday for failing a doping test last year , the Romanian Athletics Federation said . " The Romanian Athletics Federation has banned Iulia Negura from all national and international competitions for a two - year period , dating from December 4 , 1996 , " the Federation said in a statement . Negura , 30 , tested positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol after winning the gold medal at the 1996 European cross - country championships in the Belgian town of Charleroi . Her performance vaulted the national team into second place . The two medals will now be relinquished . Both Negura , considered one of Romania ' s most prominent international athlete in recent years , and her coach Dorin Melinte denied she had taken banned substances . Melinte quit his job as national long distance athletics coach after the incident , saying he could no longer work in an " atmosphere of suspicion " . " Both Iulia Negura and her trainer Dorin Melinte say she took no banned substances , " the Federation statement said . " If such substances were found in samples , this could be due to a malicious act for which , unfortunately , they have no evidence for the moment . " The ruling was announced after a second urine sample , tested in the German city of Cologne , confirmed the initial positive result . Several instances of doping have tarnished the image of Romanian athletics as competitors turned to illegal substances to win big cash prizes and foreign contracts and escape post - Communist poverty . Nine athletes , eight of them women , have been banned in the last three years . Among them was 1993 indoor world champion long jumper Marieta Ilcu - - banned two years later . Federation President Iolanda Balas told Reuters officials had limited Negura ' s ban to two years , instead of four years as stipulated by the International Athletics Federation , as the offence was her first in a long career . " A two - year ban is in accordance with a directive from the Romanian sports ministry introduced last year and applicable to all doping cases in all sports , " she said . " In Iulia Negura ' s defence was the fact that she had been tested on repeated occasions with no violations . " Negura was unavailable for comment .

New German AIDS cases fall , but women victims up . The number of new AIDS cases in Germany fell eight percent last year , but the number of women with the disease rose sharply , German researchers said on Thursday . The Robert Koch institute ( RKI ) said in a statement that 1 , 641 cases of full - blown AIDS were registered in 1996 . RKI director Reinhard Kurth said this showed the progress of the disease in Germany had stabilised and fears of a much worse epidemic had not come about . But about 260 new cases were women , the largest number ever , representing a leap of 10 percent . RKI gave no explanation for this . Around 50 , 000 people in Germany are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which causes full - blown Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . Around 80 to 85 percent of these are men , but the number of infected women has been climbing steadily in recent years . The RKI said the death rate from the disease in the capital Berlin , where many of Germany ' s AIDS patients live , had fallen slightly due to improved therapy . But Kurth said a real breakthrough in the treatment of AIDS had not yet been achieved , despite advances in therapy .

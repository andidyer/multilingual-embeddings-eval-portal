August industry output up on utilities surge . Total output by U . S . mines , factories and utilities increased strongly in August , the Federal Reserve said Tuesday , partly because of a surge in electricity output . Industrial output increased 0 . 5 percent after a slim 0 . 1 percent July gain as businesses operated at 83 . 5 percent of their maximum capacity last month , up from 83 . 3 percent in July . " Some of the acceleration from July to August resulted from weather - related swings in utility output ; manufacturing output increased 0 . 3 percent in both months , " the Fed said . " It came in a touch stronger than market expectations , " said Dan Seto , senior economist at The Nikko Securities Co . International Inc . " Overall , the manufacturing sector is crawling out of the doldrums that it had been stuck in for such a long time . " Output by utility companies jumped 1 . 5 percent in August after falling 1 . 8 percent in both June and July , when unseasonably cool weather held down electricity generation for air conditioning . Production by mining compoanies also was strong in August , climbing 2 . 4 percent after a 1 percent drop in July . The rate of motor vehicle assemblies slowed in August after a July pickup . The assembly rate for new cars was down to an annual rate of 6 . 7 million from seven million in July and for light trucks it eased to 5 . 6 million last month from six million in July . Excluding output of motor vehicles and parts , August industrial output was up 0 . 6 percent after a 0 . 1 percent decrease in July . Analysts said the report on August output was consistent with a gradually slowing economy in the second half . " When you combine the July and August numbers relative to the second quarter , you ' re seeing a deceleration in the growth rate of production that ' s going to be consistent with lower GDP in the third quarter , " said economist Bill Sharp of Smith Barney Inc . in New York . With the Fed ' s policysetting Federal Open Market Committee set to meet next Tuesday to plot interest - rate strategy , analysts have been looking for signs of a slowdown that might head off a hike in short - term interest aimed at quelling inflation .

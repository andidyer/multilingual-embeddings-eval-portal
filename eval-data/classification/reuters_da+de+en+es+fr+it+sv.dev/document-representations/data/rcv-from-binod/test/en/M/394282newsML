CBOT soy products end mostly lower on China rumors . CBOT soy product futures ended mostly lower on Friday , pressured by persistent rumors China had cancelled 450 , 000 tonnes in soymeal purchases from South America and India , traders said . Brazilian traders told Reuters they could not confirm the cancellations but said it would not be surprising given recent price action . If China bought soymeal several weeks ago at lower prices , it could resell the product now at a profit . " It makes sense from a business point of view that they actually might do it , " a trader said . " The Chinese have been known to do it before so it wouldn ' t be very surprising . " CBOT sources said the talk gave credence to recent reports that China ' s ports were clogged with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of soymeal and domestic prices had tumbled . Soymeal ended down $ 1 . 80 per ton to up $ 0 . 50 with March off $ 1 . 80 at $ 257 . 60 . Soyoil closed down 0 . 05 cent per lb to up 0 . 05 with March down 0 . 04 at 23 . 97 . Losses were limited by reports Brazilian ports were having trouble keeping up with an ambitious export program . Brazil ' s Paranagua port began loading the first of the new crop soybeans this week but harvest delays in Parana state left supplies short , traders in Brazil said . One trader told Reuters Brazil had commitments to ship 400 , 000 tonnes of soyoil and stocks were at 30 , 000 tonnes . The trader said soymeal commitments stood at 500 , 000 tonnes with a meager 36 , 000 tonnes in stock . On the day , ADM sold 300 lots March soymeal but bought 100 lots . Cargill Inc bought 200 May and 100 March and Continental Grain bought 300 March , traders said . Griffin Trading bought 200 lots each July and January and 100 lots May and December . LIT bought 300 March and Smith Barney bought 300 July and sold 500 December , traders said . Prudential Securities spread 800 lots May / March soymeal . In soyoil , Cargill Inc sold 600 lots May and 100 each March and July . Rosenthal Collins sold 600 May and ABN - Chicago Corp bought 300 May . Soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 27 , 000 lots , against Thursday ' s actual volume of 29 , 004 lots . Soyoil volume was pegged at 20 , 000 lots , compared with Thursday ' s volume of 24 , 793 lots . ( ( Emily Kaiser 312 - 408 - 8749 ) )

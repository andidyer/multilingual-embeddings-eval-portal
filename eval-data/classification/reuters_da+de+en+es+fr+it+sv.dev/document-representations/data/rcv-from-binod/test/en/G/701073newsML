ROWING - HENLEY GETS OFF TO SLOW START , BUT SUNNY WEATHER . Triple world champion Peter Haining qualified easily for the second round of the Diamond Sculls on the opening day of the Henley Regatta on Wednesday . Haining , who has won the world lightweight single sculls title three times , beat fellow Briton Derek Atkins by one length , completing the 2 , 112 - metre course in eight minutes and 40 seconds . Greg Searle , British 1992 Olympic gold medallist in the coxed pairs , received a first - round bye and enters the competition on Thursday . American Jamie Koven , who raced in the U . S . national eight which won the 1994 world title , also makes his first appearance in the second round of the five - day regatta . Onlookers were glad the sun shone and they were spared the rain which has plagued sport in Britain for weeks . But one umpire was not so concerned with the weather . " The rain is not so much of a problem for the racing . Unless the river freezes over we will carry on with the races , " he said . A headwind for much of the day meant most crews were racing into the wind , resulting in slower times . A total of 520 entries from 15 countries are competing at Henley , a regatta which is an anomaly in the rowing world . While most international competitions are raced over 2 , 000 metres on six - lane courses of still water , Henley breaks all the rules with its running stream , only two lanes and a length of one mile and 550 yards ( 2 , 112 metres ) .

Malaysia ' s Sime Darby banks on financial services . Malaysia ' s largest conglomerate , Sime Darby Bhd , said on Monday its future lay in financial services as it announced plans to buy a majority stake in Oriental Bank Bhd to merge with its Sime Bank Bhd . " The financial services sector is going to be the prime core activity of Sime Darby , " group chief executive Nik Mohamed Yaacob said after the Monday launch of Sime Bank , which was United Malayan Banking Corp until a takeover by Sime this year . " We want to make Sime Bank a major leading player , not only here in Malaysia but in the region and international ( scene ) , " Nik Mohamed told a news conference . Sime Darby , a British plantation house that became Malaysian - based in the early 1980s , has grown into an empire of 300 companies in Asia , Northern America , Europe and Africa , with interests in manufacturing , real estate , insurance services and auto dealerships , among other sectors . In April , the group moved into commercial banking for the first time in Malaysia , acquiring a 60 . 35 percent stake in UMBC , the country ' s fourth - largest bank in terms of assets , after five months of negotiations . Analysts said UMBC , now renamed Sime Bank , was the single largest contributor to the 31 percent jump in group pre - tax profit to 1 . 33 billion ringgit ( $ 528 million ) posted by Sime Darby in the financial year to June 30 , 1996 . Nik Mohamed said Sime Darby planned to buy 51 percent or more of Oriental Bank , to build up Sime Bank ' s capital to face domestic and international competition . " This is in line with the government ' s encouragement for local banks to merge , " he said . Malaysia ' s central bank , Bank Negara , has been pushing quietly for mergers among local financial institutions to prepare them for the planned opening of Malaysia ' s heavily protected financial market to foreign competition by early 2000 . " Our idea is to make them into meaningful and significant institutions in order to compete effectively and to serve the needs of the country and market , " said Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim , who presided over Sime Bank ' s launch ceremony on Monday . The latest tie - up between Kwong Yik Bank , a unit of Malayan Banking Bhd , and DCB Bank , a subsidiary of stockbrokerage Rashid Hussain Bhd , had stirred the market ' s imagination for mergers , analysts said . Nik Mohamed said it was premature to estimate what Sime Darby was willing to pay for a majority stake in Oriental Bank as the bank was not listed and official negotiations would only start early next year . " We had a look at a few of the available banks , and Oriental is one of them in terms of branch location , human resources and type of products , which we wanted . But we ' ve yet to see the numbers , " he added , referring to the bank ' s equity structure and value . Oriental Bank posted a 60 . 3 percent jump in net income to 139 . 1 million ringgit for the year ended March 31 , 1996 , according to the latest annual report of its parent , Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd . The bank had share capital of 326 million ringgit and shareholders ' funds of 424 million ringgit , the report said . Nik Mohamed said Sime Darby planned to list Sime Bank in 1998 after the merger . - - Kuala Lumpur newsroom ( 603 - 2307509 ) ( $ 1 = 2 . 52 ringgit )

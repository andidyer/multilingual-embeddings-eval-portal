Brent cargoes are traded on a paper , or forward market until the 1700 London time deadline on the nearest trading day 15 days before their assigned loading date . A trading company is clocked when it is left with a paper cargo which has turned physical after that deadline and therefore cannot be passed on as part of pre - sold paper cargo deals . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7646

NATO PLANS " SUPER PFP " TO EASE EXPANSION . NATO planners are developing a " super " Partnership for Peace to embrace countries likely to be left out of the first wave of expansion of the alliance , its Secretary - General and Western diplomats said on Thursday . With the Western alliance likely to accept some former communist countries into its fold next year , diplomats say some non - aligned nations and unsuccessful NATO candidates may join a tighter grouping of would - be members and affiliates . Russia could also join this intensified Partnership for Peace - - dubbed " PfP - Two " , " Enhanced PfP " or " PfP Plus " - - which aims to boost non - members ' military cooperation and political contact with NATO , a U . S . diplomat told Reuters . " Let ' s include the Russians , " said Derek Shearer , U . S . ambassador to Finland . The plan aims to demonstrate to Russia that NATO is not belligerent and ease the concerns of countries that may fall into a security " grey zone " after the alliance expands . " A ' PfP Plus ' should generate the necessary reassurance that the security of an enlarged NATO and its partners remains closely linked , " said NATO Secretary - General Javier Solana . Of the 27 current members of the PfP scheme aimed at uniting former European foes , Shearer said between 15 and 20 could join a super PfP , which could involve specific liaison officers and working groups and would be based on charters . " It ' s just a notion of enhancing PfP to show where we ' re going in Europe , " he said . The scheme builds on a milestone speech by U . S . Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Stuttgart earlier this month in which he outlined a vision of a New Atlantic Community which would erase former Cold War barriers . Christopher spoke of forming a New Atlantic Partnership Council based on a charter between NATO and Russia and said the alliance should involve non - members in the PfP programme . NATO ' s Solana , in a speech to the international institute for strategic studies ( IISS ) , said the current scheme was already the most successful military cooperation programme in Europe ' s history . " But ( it ) has to be upgraded and deepened to reflect the new situation which will exist after NATO enlargement , " he said . " This could entail , among other things , offering interested partners greater involvement in NATO military planning , activities and structures as well as in consultations with the alliance . " Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Poland are widely regarded as top of the list for inclusion in an expanded NATO . Other former Soviet Bloc states including the Baltic countries , Romania and Bulgaria are less likely to make it into the first round . " You don ' t want them feeling this means ' no ' forever , " Shearer said . The scheme could also embrace non - aligned and neutral countries - - Finland , Sweden and Austria - - which do not currently seek NATO membership , offsetting concerns that NATO expansion may be seen as re - creating " zones of influence " . For instance , Finland , Sweden and the three Baltic states , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , have said expansion in central Europe may leave former Soviet satellites in a security void which , under some circumstances , Russia could try to fill . " We want to see the avoidance of the grey area by the development of a super - PfP , " another Western diplomat said . With Europe still in transition from the Cold War period , the plan aims to let countries address threats like terrorism and drug - trafficking , which are now more likely causes of instability than invasion , diplomats said .

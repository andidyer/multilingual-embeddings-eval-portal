Swedish debt yields end lower on global trends . Swedish debt yields closed lower after an eventful Wednesday . A weaker crown initially weighed on sentiment , but buyers later entered the market as debt yields abroad started to drop . " We are at a point where Sweden looks fundamentally cheap " , an analyst said . The deputy governor of the Riksbank , Sweden ' s central bank , added further impetus to the market after saying Sweden ' s membership in EMU only was a question of timing . Dealers believe a further drop in debt yields is in the cards for Thursday . Nine - year debt yields shed 11 basis points to 6 . 76 percent . A softer crown did , however , put the brakes on the shorter end of the market with six - month T - bills falling three basis points to 4 . 06 percent . The crown was somewhat more shaky after news that the Italian lira probably will not be allowed to enter Europe ' s planned Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) from the start in 1999 . Dealers expected the crown to fall further on Thursday . The crown softened to 4 . 4760 against the mark , up from 4 . 4505 late on Tuesday . - - Stockholm newsroom + 46 8 700 1010

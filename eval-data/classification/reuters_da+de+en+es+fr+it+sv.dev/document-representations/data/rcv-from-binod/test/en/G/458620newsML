Confusion as Mobutu ' s plane lands in Zaire capital . Ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko ' s plane landed in Zaire ' s capital on Friday but the veteran leader did not immediately appear causing considerable confusion about his state of health , witnesses said . Mobutu , who has just had fresh cancer treatment , left France earlier on Friday on board the private jet to try to salvage what remains of his authority in Zaire in the face of relentless rebel advances . A welcoming committee , which included senior military men and members of the government , waited for about 20 minutes to greet him before withdrawing . It was later asked to go to his official residence to wait . Journalists were ushered away . Mobutu ' s limousine was waiting at the foot of the steps of the plane . His presidential guard was out in force but there were none of the crowds who turned out to welcome him during a triumphant homecoming on December 17 . Earlier , Laurent Kabila ' s rebels , who have been fighting to topple him since October , rejected a truce - then - talks call from the veteran leader and said his return made no difference . " We negotiate first , " Kabila said on arrival in Zaire ' s third city of Kisangani , which fell to the rebels last weekend . " He ( Mobutu ) always wants to buy time . But we will not play his game , " rebel political commissioner Deo Bugera said there . Mobutu , 66 , left hospital in Monaco on Wednesday after fresh treatment . He issued a statement on Thursday calling for a truce and a national council to find a peace settlement . " He will address the nation to mark his position clearly , " his son Mobutu Nzanga told Reuters in Nice . " My father remains an important player in the stability of Central Africa . " But many ordinary Zaireans , eager for a change from three decades of poverty and hardship under Mobutu , are openly rallying to Kabila . Residents of Kinshasa ' s poor districts openly welcome the prospect of his arrival in the capital . Kabila ' s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo - Zaire ( ADFL ) is advancing relentlessly across the sprawling and chaotic Central African nation , where central government control has long been notional in many places . Under foreign pressure to agree a truce and talk , Kabila says only face - to - face talks with Mobutu can halt the fighting . Mobutu ' s son , Nzanga , said on Thursday that his father no longer ruled out talks with rebel leaders but wanted to involve the government , army and transitional parliament . " His intention is to find a solution to the present crisis in consultation with parliament , the government and the military high command . " Mobutu has spent most of his time in Europe since having prostate cancer surgery in August . He has dominated Zaire with a mixture of political acumen and military ruthlessness since seizing power in 1965 . He presented his proposed national council as a formula to find " appropriate ways " out of the crisis " with all our brothers , without exclusion " . The rebels were not the only ones unimpressed . " He is sure to come with his usual confusion . Everything is possible , a good move , a bad move and the worst possible move . But he will above all be thinking of himself , " one senior government member said . The rebels took up arms in October in a dispute about Zairean nationality for an ethnic Tutsi minority , who form the core of Kabila ' s fighting force . An alliance of anti - Mobutu groups rallied around the cause .

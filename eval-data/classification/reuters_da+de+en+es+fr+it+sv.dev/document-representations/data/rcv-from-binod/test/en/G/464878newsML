South China province says no word on war games . Officials from a south China province facing Taiwan said on Monday they were not aware of any plans to hold war games along the coast in the near future . " At the moment I have not heard of any plans to hold war games , " an official of the Fujian provincial government told Reuters by telephone . Taiwan ' s stock market was badly shaken by a report in a major Taiwanese newspaper that China planned to hold military exercises in three coastal provinces , including Fujian which faces the island . The United Daily News said the exercises might be linked to the current visit to Taiwan by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama . Beijing has been angered by the Dalai Lama ' s visit , saying it had political motives . " As far as I know , Fujian has not scheduled any military exercises , " a government official said . The Taiwan newspaper said the joint exercises would also be held in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces . Officials in these two coastal provinces could not be reached for immediate comment . China held war games along its southern coast last year in a bid to intimidate Taiwan . The United States sent warships near the island in a show of force .

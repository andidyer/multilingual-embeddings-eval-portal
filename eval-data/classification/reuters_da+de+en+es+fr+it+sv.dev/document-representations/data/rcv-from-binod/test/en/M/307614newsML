U . S . says Swiss moving appropiately on Nazi gold . Switzerland is moving appropiately to review its historic financial relationship with Nazi Germany , a senior U . S . official said on Monday . Commerce Undersecretary Stuart Eizenstat , chairman of a U . S . interagency task force that is looking into what the United States knew about those ties , told Jewish community leaders that they should cooperate with Swiss authorities . " I think it is important to understand that the Swiss government is moving in a very appropiate way to try to look at a very painful period , " he said at a luncheon hosted by the Jewish B ' nai B ' rith organisation . " It is very important for my mission that we continue to work with the Swiss government and other governments as they go through their review processes , " he added . Eizenstat said recent reports that the Swiss National Bank shipped truckloads of Nazi gold to Spain and Portugal at the height of the Second World War suggested that several countries were involved in the case . The gold was probably looted from the central banks of European countries plundered by the Nazis and from Jewish victims in Nazi death camps , according to Jewish community organisations . Eizenstat , who travelled to Switzerland in May to talk to government and banking authorities , is due to return to the European country later this month . The Swiss government has established a commission of historians to look at the entire relationship between Switzerland and Nazi Germany during the war . Switzerland remained diplomatically neutral during the conflict . However , U . S . historians say its banks and industries supported the Nazi war effort with financial services , machine tools , electrical equipment , small arms and ammunition . The Swiss government also set up a commission headed by former U . S . Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to review all bank accounts opened by its financial institutions between 1933 and 1945 which have remained inactive for more than one decade . Jewish organisations have charged that Swiss banks hold millions of dollars deposited by Jews who were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust . The Volcker commission expects to have a preliminary audit completed by mid - 1997 , Eizenstat said . The United States is conducting its own review of what role its government played in retrieving and distributing Nazi gold and other assets after the war . As an example , Eizenstat mentioned that some $ 68 million in gold was still held in the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from a 1946 agreement with Switzerland to compensate claims from European countries . " The question of how that residual of gold will be distributed is a matter we are reviewing at this point , " he added . The United States ' 11 - agency task force aims to present a preliminary historic report by mid - February , Eizenstat said . The government will also publish an index of all the archival material obtained in the course of that review .

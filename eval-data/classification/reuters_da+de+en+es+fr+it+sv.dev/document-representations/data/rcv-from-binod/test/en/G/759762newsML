" Evita " Albright pokes fun in ASEAN skit . Madeleine Albright popped a flower in her hair on Monday and sang a song from " Evita " in a fun - poking skit by U . S . diplomats to entertain foreign colleagues at a key Asian forum . The U . S . Secretary of State , attending for the first time the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) regional forum in the capital of Malaysia , cemented her reputation as an often unorthodox diplomat who likes to have fun . Backed by a chorus of senior U . S . officials at a conference dinner attended by 500 regional leaders and officials , Albright performed a parody of the lead song from the musical " Evita " entitled : " Don ' t cry for me ASEANies . " Skits are a curious part of the annual ASEAN ritual and every year the Americans complain that theirs is the feeblest of all the delegations . The Japanese are reported to work on their presentation for months while the Americans cobble theirs together at the last moment - - which happened again this year . But this time Albright chose the theme , helped write the lyrics and played the lead role - - with a flower in her hair . To those not steeped in the arcana of ASEAN politics , the allusions may be cryptic , but they poked fun at people and issues the regional group - - including partners like the United States - - usually treat with great seriousness . Take U . S . billionaire George Soros , whom Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused of destabilising regional currencies , drawing sharp opposition from the United States which argued that " market movements are not dominated by a small number of currency speculators , let alone one person " . Madeleine " Evita " Albright sang : " I came here to talk to your leadersBut they were all on the golf courseSo I went back to Sunway LagunaAnd called George SorosTalked market forcesHatched a conspiracyThe rest is history " The Sunway Lagoon is the resort near Kuala Lumpur where the conference is being held . Referring to the alleged repressive nature of some Asian governments , she joked about them putting her under house arrest , suggested that ASEAN - - which this year made Burma a member over strong U . S . objections - - might also want to take in Cuba and Iraq and proclaimed ASEAN men " Asia ' s sexiest " . There was a personal note : " I was told I should roar like a lionAnd wake the bad men from their sleepBut I ' d much rathershop , flirt and courtesyAt heart I ' m reallyLittle Bo Peep " Because the programme was more daring than normal ASEAN fare , the Americans felt the need to open with a warning . State Department spokesman Nichols Burns planned to assure the audience : " This is totally humorous . We don ' t mean it . Please don ' t take offence . Half of this pokes fun at us . "

Bonds , rate hopes to lift SAfrica shares next week . Expectations of a continued rally on South Africa ' s bond market and high hopes for a cut in interest rates are seen lifting Johannesburg industrial shares to fresh peaks next week , market analysts said on Friday . Sectors sensitive to rate movements , including stores , banking and construction , were expected to benefit most , taking the industrial index to new highs ahead of an expected reduction in the country ' s high lending rates . Highly geared firms also stood to gain strongly . " I am bullish on industrials and the bond market , " said Peer Iuel , managing director of UAL Securities . " People are anticipating ( a cut ) and there is good institutional buying , " he told Reuters . A swathe of local economic data is due to be released next week , all of which should continue to point the way to a lowering of the key Bank rate , currently at 17 percent . Money supply growth , private sector credit extension growth and consumer inflation are all expected to have fallen in June , adding further ammunition to economists calling for at least a one percentage point fall by the end of the year . In this environment , key long bonds are expected to probe decisively below the psychologically important 14 . 00 percent level next week - - above which they were hovering on Friday . But some analysts said that the stock market had already largely discounted a rate cut and that some sectors were becoming expensive . " Retailers have been running a bit too hard on the interest rate speculation recently , " said Denzil Newman of Syfrets Managed Assets . The retail - studded stores sector has since early June soared a massive 24 percent , led largely by clothing stores , despite some leading firms saying that trading conditions are still tough . Analysts said recent good foreign interest in the South African bourse , especially from emerging market funds , looked set to continue next week . Foreigners have so far bought over 12 . 4 billion rands worth of shares this year compared with around 4 . 9 billion in the same period in 1996 . " I think emerging market funds have been way underweight in South Africa . Their average weighting is about four percent and it should be about nine percent according to the emerging market index , " Ieul said . Smaller capitalisation stocks were seen still flavour of the month following the sprouting of a number of new emerging company and specialist mutual funds . Firmly focused on local events , shares were expected to continue ignoring movements on Wall Street bar a massive move either way on the U . S . stock market . Gold shares , recently ravaged by bullion ' s slide to 12 - year lows , were seen slavishly tracking the metal although some upside was possible from oversold positions . Better - than - expected second quarter results from some of the country ' s mining firms , notably gold giant Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd , could also pump up ailing stocks . But reports that East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd , managed by Randgold may cease operations on the low gold price , would continue to weigh . On the company earnings front , robust year results are expected from both chemicals firm Polifin Ltd and electronics company Persetel Holdings Ltd , both of which will report on Thursday . - - Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

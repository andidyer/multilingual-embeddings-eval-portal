S . African stock market closing report . South African shares finished barely up from their starting levels on Monday , but dealers said that overall trade was positive . Shares traded in a very tight range throughout the day . " It was pretty much a nothing happening day , but the indices all held well , " one dealer said . Industrials finished slightly firmer after gaining more ground earlier and thwarting market expectations that they would suffer a weaker day in the wake of Wall Street ' s Friday losses and bucking the trend of weaker world markets . Dealers said that industrial shares found support from a strong rand and bond rates . " The rand was very strong today and if this carries on we could see shares starting to form a nice base , " a dealer said . The rand ended three cents firmer at the local close . But gold shares were not as bright after the rand began to strengthen , dealers said . Having suffered lately due to a vulnerable bullion price , the gold index hopped up when it appeared that bullion was safely sitting above the $ 353 an ounce level but these small gains soon shrank as the rand firmed . " Golds finished up but did come off as the rand strengthened , " one dealer said . The gold index added 4 . 9 points to 1 , 375 . 3 points , the all - share index put on 4 . 7 points to 6 , 689 . 3 and the industrial index was up 1 . 1 points at 8 , 043 . 9 points . Volumes were moderate and took time to pick up from the morning ' s quiet trade . Most activity was in smaller stocks , dealers said . " It wasn ' t very busy . Not a hectic day at all . Volume was about 55 million shares with a value of 462 million rand , " one dealer said . Dealers said that the local market would be eyeing Wall Street for direction on Tuesday . Rembrandt was up 65 cents at 42 . 50 rand , RMB added 275 cents to 78 rand , Gold Fields shed 200 cents to 107 rand , Investec put on 400 cents to 128 rand and Sappi lost 55 cents to 40 . 70 rand . Industrial share futures were slightly firmer in late trade , finding support from a strong rand and bond rates , but contracts came off earlier stronger levels . Gold futures were unchanged from their previous settlement level , trapped by a steady bullion price . The March all - share contract stood at 6 , 135 / 50 from 6 , 143 , the industrial contract was at 7 , 832 / 40 from 7 , 811 and the gold contract was at 968 / 70 from 968 . - - Melanie Cheary , Johannesburg newsroom , + 27 11 482 1003

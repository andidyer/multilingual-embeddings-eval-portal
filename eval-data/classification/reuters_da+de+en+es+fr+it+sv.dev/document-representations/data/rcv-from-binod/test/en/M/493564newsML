Mexico Cetes rate edges down on stable peso . Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended five basis points down at 23 . 20 percent on Tuesday . Traders said a mostly stable peso offset upside pressure from likely forthcoming hikes in domestic interest rates . " The market was very calm because today is ( primary ) auction day , every one is waiting for the outcome , " a trader said . Another trader pointed out that a firm peso helped to bring secondary rates down . " If we were to look at just the ( peso - dollar ) exchange rate , then secondary rates would have to be lower , " he said . Benchmark 48 - hour peso contracts ended 0 . 5 centavos weaker at 7 . 9000 / 7 . 9040 per dollar , after being firmer for most of the day . A Reuters survey of money market dealers showed they predicted Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 28 - day Cetes rates at an average of 22 . 66 percent at its weekly auction to be held later in the day .

Afghan women urge U . N . to condemn Taleban . About 200 Afghan women demanded on Wednesday that the United Nations condemn the rebel Islamic Taleban militia for what they called violations of women ' s rights in Taleban - held parts of Afghanistan . About 200 women from the Afghan Women ' s Islamic Renaissance gathered outside a U . N . office in Kabul to hand a letter to U . N . Secretary - General Boutros Boutros - Ghali . The letter complained that the Taleban had prevented women from going to school and from working in offices . " The United Nations must officially condemn the Taleban for violating women ' s rights in the southwestern provinces , particularly in Herat , " the letter said . The militant Islamic Taleban cracked down on women receiving education or engaging in paid employment after capturing the western city of Herat a year ago . Taleban leaders say they do not oppose education for women , but say it must take place within an Islamic framework once peace has been restored throughout Afghanistan . The United Nations has halted educational programmes in Taleban - held areas because of the strictures . Some charities , such as Save The Children , have suspended all their activities in Taleban - controlled territories in protest .

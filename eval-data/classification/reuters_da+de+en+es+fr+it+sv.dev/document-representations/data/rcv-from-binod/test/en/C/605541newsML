DuPont clears decks , but needs big deal . The sale of EI Dupont & Nemours graphic films and offset printing plate unit shows its commitment to exiting businesses which do not meet its return targets , but the key question before the company is whether it needs to buy to grow . DuPont has set itself a target of 12 percent return on capital and to grow earnings by 10 - 12 percent a year . While DuPont did not disclose terms of the pending deal , they did say that they expected a non - recurring charge associated with the sale of the unit with 1996 sales of $ 600 million . While DuPont ' s peers such as ICI Plc , Unilver NV and Monsanto have been actively forging relationships , DuPont has watched its cash pile grow to $ 2 . 5 billion and has $ 10 billion in spending power . " With the stock market where it is now , there are not many bargains out there and DuPont has been very conservative in what it is prepared to pay , " said Donald Carson , chemicals analyst at JP Morgan . DuPont is known to have looked at parts of Unilever ' s specialty chemicals business , which was bought by Britain ' s ICI in a deal worth 5 . 0 billion stg , the company also looked at the Holden ' s Foundation Seeds business , which was bought by Monsanto for some $ 1 . 0 billion , but was held back by the stiff price being demanded . Analysts say that while there may be smaller tactical buys , such as ICI ' s Tioxode business , the number two producer of titanium dioxide in a world where DuPont is number one , or some infill buying such as ICI ' s European polyester or Australian unit , the company realises it needs to think big . One potential target is genetic engineering company Pioneer Hi - Bred Corp , the leading producer and marketer of hybrid seed corn , for which Monsanto also made a bid which fell through . " They could not undertake a hostile bid for Pioneer because of the family ' s 15 percent holding , but this is a business they would really like to expand , " said Carson . Other analysts question the need for a company like DuPont to get involved in owning a seed company . " There is a lot of money being thrown around in the biotechnology sector . Whether or not DuPont needs to be in that business is open to debate , " said Leslie Ravitz , analyst at Morgan Stanley . One key question is the future of its Conoco energy unit . Conoco ' s upstream segment has been enormously profitable , but in common with the rest of the refining industry , the downstream sector has been beset with low margins . Conoco already has a presence in Venezuela and analysts say that it could capitalise on its heavy oil refining capacity to ally with the national oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela . " If they want to do a $ 30 - $ 40 billion acquisition , then DuPont will sell Conoco . If its is a $ 5 . 0 billion deal , they do not need to , " said Ravitz . Also , DuPont has other options to consider , it is exiting coal and has some more restructuring to do . Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Thomas Semegran says he does not believe there has to be an acquisition . " They are expanding their core businesses of Nylon and Lycra in Asia and we believe that they would like to conclude a significant joint venture in agrochemicals which would be a good fit with their existing business , " he said . Whatever sector Du Pont decides to enter or expand , investors are certain to start questioning what the company is doing with its cash mountain and how chief executive John Krol will grow earnings by 10 - 12 percent a year .

FORECAST - Northern Foods H1 profit seen flat . British food producer Northern Foods Plc is expected to show flat first half profits when it unveils results on Wednesday , reflecting weakness in dairy commodity prices , sector analysts said on Friday . It is forecast to show pretax profit of 57 - 58 million stg for the six months to September 30 , after a year - earlier profit of 57 . 2 million excluding a 4 . 1 million loss on disposals . " Most of Northern is trading satisfactorily , their prepared foods side in particular is making good progress , but the dairy side will be down because of the weakness in bulk commodities , " said Michael Bourke , an analyst at Panmure Gordon . The company warned in July that trading was being affected by weakness in dairy commodity prices , but said its 91 million stg restructuring charge for its dairy operations had helped its prepared food businesses . Just under half of Northern ' s sales come from dairy operations , with the other core business , its prepared foods arm which supplies foods and a range of convenience foods . " The restructuring was to adapt to the reduction in the amount of milk sold on the doorstep . That is the biggest part of their dairy division and things there are probably better than they were with capacity in line with demand , " said Bourke . Analysts forecast that Northern Foods will show a modest increase in its dividend payment to around 3 . 6p per share from 3 . 5p at the halfway stage last year . " The continued decline in profitability of doorstep milk will hold things back and there will be a vague hangover from the BSE issue , " said one analyst at a British bank . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4019

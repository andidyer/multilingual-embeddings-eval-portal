Sri Lankan rebels attack army defences in north . Separatist Tamil rebels launched a pre - dawn attack on the military ' s defences near the northern town of Vavuniya on Tuesday in a bid to cut off supplies to troops fighting further north , military officials said . They said Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels launched a major attack on the military ' s forward defence line between Thandikulam and Nochchimoddai just north of Vavuniya . The government - held town of Vavuniya lies some 220 km ( 135 miles ) north of the capital Colombo . " A large number of LTTE infiltrated the defences and carried out an attack on troops guarding the area , " a military official in the north told Reuters . " Ground troops are carrying out clearing operations at this moment . We expect casualties to be rather heavy on both sides , " the official said . The Defence Ministry in Colombo confirmed the attack and said the rebels had been repelled . " The attack was repulsed by troops , inflicting a large number of casualties among the terrorists . The area that came under attack is being cleared at present , " a ministry statement said . Reports from the north said the rebels had blown up a key bridge at Nochchimoddai , from where security forces launched a major offensive on the rebels ' northern Wanni stronghold nearly one month ago . Reports also said the rebels , fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in mainly Sinhalese Sri Lanka ' s north and east , had blown up government ammuniton supplies near Nochchimoddai . The Defence Ministry said details on these reports were not yet available . Independent confirmation of events is not possible as international media have not been allowed into the war zone . The LTTE were not immediately available for comment . A Defence Ministry spokesman said troops , which had advanced about 20 km ( 12 . 5 miles ) north from Nochchimoddai into the rebel heartland , were consolidating in freshly captured areas . " They will patch the defences which had been breached and then continue with the advance , " a military official in the north said . The Defence Ministry spokesman said the attack would not be a setback to troops who had already captured several rebel - held towns in the shrub - covered Wanni , driving the LTTE further north . " By this evening , we will take full control of the situation ( at Nochchimoddai ) , allowing troops to carry on with the offensive , " he said . " We have enough troops to guard the rear and advance at the same time . " Some 20 , 000 government troops are advancing on two flanks into the rebel stronghold . The army captured the towns of Omanthai , 14 km ( nine miles ) north of Vavuniya on one flank , and Nedunkeni , 40 km ( 25 miles ) northeast of Vavuniya on the other , in the offensive which was launched on May 13 . Deputy Defence Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said last week that the offensive ' s aim was to open a land supply route to Jaffna , 100 km ( 60 miles ) further north of Vavuniya , that would help rehabilitation work there . The north - south highway has been closed for more than 10 years due to the war which began in 1983 . Troops captured the LTTE ' s former stronghold of Jaffna last year in a major offensive , driving the rebels into the Wanni . The government says more than 50 , 000 people have been killed since the war began . The rebels say the toll is higher .

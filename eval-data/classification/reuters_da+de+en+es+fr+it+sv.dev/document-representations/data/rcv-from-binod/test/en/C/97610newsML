Indonesia ' s Sampoerna says Astra purchase aimed at growth . Indonesian cigarette giant PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna said on Friday its recent purchase of a stake in automobile conglomerate Astra International was part of efforts to seek opportunities for future growth . " From a strategic point of view we are trying to identify opportunities wherein there is strong management expertise , there are strong brand equities , there is excellent distribution and there is also profitability , " Sampoerna corporate development director Jonathan Zax told Reuters . Zax disagreed with comments by ratings agency Standard & Poor ' s Corp that the decision to buy a 2 . 85 percent equity investment in the country ' s largest vehicle manufacturer , Astra , could lead to heightened credit risk . " While the magnitude of the investment is not at this point material , Standard & Poor ' s considers the investment to be outside the expected expansion parameters of kretek manufacturer Sampoerna , and could lead to heightened credit risk , " S & P said on Tuesday . Zax said the move was based on a strategy for growth . Standard and Poor ' s said it had placed its BBB - plus corporate credit rating of PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna on creditwatch with negative implications . S & P said it had also put the BBB rating on the US dollar - denominated guaranteed notes issued by Sampoerna ' s subsidiary , Sampoerna International Finance Co B . V . , on creditwatch with negative implications . The ratings agency said the rating action followed an announcement on Tuesday by Sampoerna that its 100 percent subsidiary , Sampoerna Investment Corporation , had bought a 2 . 85 percent stake or 33 . 18 million shares , in Astra at a cost of 157 . 61 billion rupiah ( $ 67 . 8 million ) . The share purchase was separate from the 9 . 81 percent holding in Astra bought by Sampoerna founder and president director Putera Sampoerna , Zax said earlier . Putera Sampoerna now effectively controls 12 . 66 percent of Astra , the largest single holding in the car manufacturer . " Our investment policy will be that we will look for opportunities which can provide value to operations , and strong management and strong brands , " Zax said . Zax declined to elaborate whether PT Sampoerna expected to increase or decrease its stake in Astra in the near or long term . He also declined to say what the firm plans for Astra ' s diverse range of business interests should it gain management control over the automobile conglomerate . " We are not in a position to comment at this time on any future plan on questions of management input and plans to decrease or increase stake , " Zax said . Zax also declined to elaborate whether the firm expected in the long term to capitalise on Astra ' s extensive dealership network , in a bid to boost its sales . " I am not suggesting there are synergies from components of Astra and components of Sampoerna . What I am saying is that we believe that the management of Astra will be capable of realising more value from their operations than is currently the case , " Zax said . Sampoerna , Indonesia ' s largest cigarette firm , manufactures and markets premium brands . The company posted a net profit of 186 . 40 billion rupiah ( $ 80 . 2 million ) in the first six months of 1996 , against 161 . 89 billion rupiah in the same period of last year . Astra International has interests across a range of industries , including automobile , agriculture and banking .

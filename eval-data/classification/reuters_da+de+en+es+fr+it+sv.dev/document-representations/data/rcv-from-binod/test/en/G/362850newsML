WFP says Zaire troops stop aid workers leaving . The U . N . World Food Programme ( WFP ) said Zairean troops were stopping six of its Zairean aid workers on Friday from leaving a U . N . compound in the eastern Zairean town of Lubutu . " We have received reports that six WFP national staff in a U . N . compound in Lubutu are surrounded by the Zairean military who are preventing them from leaving , " WFP spokeswoman Michelle Quintaglie said . " One of the staff , a radio operator , has been mistreated and all radio communication cut off . The situation in Lubutu is very tense at the moment , " said Quintaglie in Nairobi . " We hope this incident will be resolved quickly and these people will be sympathetic to the fact that our staff in the compound are aid workers , " she added . She said four aid workers including two WFP staff had been evacuated from Lubutu earlier on Friday by plane to Kisangani . U . N . sources said earlier aid agencies planned to pull the last 24 workers out by air on Friday from Tingi Tingi , seven km ( four miles ) southeast of Lubutu and the largest refugee camp in east Zaire , to Kisangani because of rebel advances on the area . They said the 24 at Tingi Tingi camp would be " relocated " to Kisangani and the estimated 120 , 000 Rwandan refugees there were also said to be preparing to leave before rebel forces arrived .

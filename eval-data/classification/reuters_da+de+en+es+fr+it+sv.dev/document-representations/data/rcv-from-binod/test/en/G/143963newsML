Afghan Taleban warplanes roar into action . Two Taleban warplanes roared over Kabul and headed north to bomb positions of the ousted Afghan government on Friday as the purist Islamic militia appeared to deal a potentially fatal blow to ceasefire talks . Reuters correspondent Chris Bird reported from the northern side of the front lines that one warplane tried to bomb the town of Jabal os - Siraj , some 70 km ( 44 miles ) north of the capital that the Taleban captured a month ago . The bomb landed in a field and no one was hurt . There were no immediate reports of where the other bomber went . On Thursday , a Taleban bomber hit the village of Kalakan , 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of the capital on the same road . Kalakan is held by the forces of former government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood . At least 14 civilians were killed . Bird said hundreds of troops loyal to northern Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum were in Jabal os - Siraj . He allied with Masood two weeks ago and sent tanks , artillery and men to the front lines . At the same time he was conducting ceasefire talks with the Taleban brokered by Pakistan and United Nations Special Envoy Norbert Holl , and the Taleban had said until Wednesday there was no evidence his men were in action . However , on Thursday , Acting Information Minister Amir Khan Mutaqi told the Pakistan - based Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) the Uzbeks " have openly taken part in the offensives " against the Islamist Taleban . Mutaqi was quoted as saying that those killed included a general whose documents showed he belonged to Dostum ' s forces , dimming already slim hopes of a ceasefire with the two sides . Mutaqi had said on Wednesday Dostum was a man the Taleban could do business with , but that if it did become clear his men were involved in the fighting north of Kabul , he would be regarded as an enemy . Holl had been scheduled to fly to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Thursday , where the Taleban have their headquarters , but there was no immediate word on whether he had achieved a breakthrough . Mutaqi also told AIP that Dostum ' s men had helped Masood two weeks ago to take Jabal os - Siraj and the nearby town of Charikar , both on the main road from Kabul to the Salang Pass through the Hindu Kush mountains . His reference to the dead Uzbek general appeared to relate to attempts by the alliance to take the De Sabz pass on the so - called new road that then rolls across the eastern side of the dusty plain to Kabul some 30 km ( 19 miles ) away . Military analysts in Kabul say the alliance needs to wrest the pass from Taleban control and move down the new road to cover the flank of Masood ' s forces battling down the main road that runs parallel near the western side of the plain . There , the front line is about 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of the Kabul city limits and has been static for several days . On Friday morning , the two sides exchanged artillery and rocket fire , but Taleban fighters near the front said neither side had made any progress . They said that apart from intermittent exchanges of fire , the fronts had been fairly quiet since Thursday afternoon . The relative lull enabled hundreds of refugees to flee the combat zone on Friday morning , most of them in dozens of trucks loaded with bundles , bedding and furniture with men , women and children riding on top .

RTRS - Woolworths confident on wholesale move . Grocery retailer Woolworths Ltd said on Monday it was confident the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) would clear the planned expansion of its Australian Independent Wholesalers Pty Ltd ( AIW ) unit . " We don ' t anticipate any significant reason why we cannot continue to do this . We ' re not the only one that does wholesale and retail . Secondly , this is organic growth of an existing business , " Woolworths managing director Reg Clairs told a news conference . " I don ' t predict there would be any reason that the ACCC would impede the process , " he said . Woolworths acquired AIW in July last year as part of its purchase of the Cannons group of stores based in the Australian Capital Territory ( ACT ) . Clairs said its decision to expand AIW followed approaches to the company by independent supermarkets and after researching the market . " We would argue that we ' re not simply a food retailer , we ' re in the business of food distribution . That ' s been evidence by our move into food export and a number of other initiatives , " Clairs said . The head of Woolworths supermarkets division , John Brunton said the company was not looking for the benefits of synergies between AIW and Woolworths and its inhouse wholesale operation . " It ' s not something that that we have said that we want to go into ourselves . It ' s a matter of responding to requests that have come to us from independents , " Brunton said . Asked why independents had approached Woolworths , he said : " Independents are independent - - being deprived of their ability to have choice has probably created some anxiety . " Clairs said at this stage it had not signed up any new independent supermarkets and as yet it had not made a significant investment in the expansion . After the Woolworths statement , Quensland - based buying agent Retail Services Ltd ( RSL ) said it had no intention of changing its current wholesaling arrangements with food wholesaler Davids Ltd . RSL , which organises the buying of groceries on behalf of more than 450 independent supermarkets , has a long - term contract for supply from Davids . In a statement , RSL said the Woolworths plan to supply Queensland independent supermarkets would further divide the independent market and could lead to more family - owned stores closing , with huge job losses . - - Michael Stapleton , Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

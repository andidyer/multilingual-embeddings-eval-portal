KINSHASA WORKS NORMALLY AHEAD OF BANNED MARCH . Kinshasa went to work normally on Wednesday ahead of a march called by the main political opposition in Laurent Kabila ' s Democratic Republic of Congo in defiance of a ban . A couple of soldiers patrolled near the Central Station rallying point for the march but there was little sign of opposition militants . Residents went to work as normal . Earlier , state radio restated the ban imposed on political activity and public demonstrations in the city by Kabila ' s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo . The Union for Democracy and Social Progress ( UDPS ) of Etienne Tshisekedi , a veteran opponent of ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko , has called marches for Wednesday and Friday . " Despite the ban , there will be a democratic march tomorrow , " Jean - Marie Vianney Kabukanye , national secretary of the UDPS youth wing , said on Tuesday . " We have not changed Mobutu to replace him with another Mobutu . The man has changed but not the policies , " he told Reuters in the opposition stronghold of Limete . Kabila ' s forces did not try to prevent him giving a news conference . Wednesday ' s showdown comes one day before Kabila ' s formal inauguration as president . Kabila , who proclaimed himself president on May 17 as his rebels entered the capital , left the city on Tuesday for the southern mining capital of Lubumbashi , officials said , adding that he would return in time for Thursday ' s inauguration . " We are restoring order , we know that there are enemies and that demonstrations boost supporters of the former regime , " Information Minister Raphael Ghenda told Reuters on Tuesday . " People say ( we ) must be given time to show what ( we ) can do and if they are not happy then of course ( there can be ) demonstrations , " he said . Opposition militants say troops from Rwanda and other neighbours , who helped Kabila ' s forces during their seven - month civil war , are deployed in the capital . " Foreign troops must leave as soon as possible or risk appearing like occupation troops , " Vianney said . State radio and television said that Kabila would take office on Thursday at the People ' s Palace parliament building and that the inauguration would be his " first official outing " . Officials declined to say why he had gone to Lubumbashi . Opposition activists marched in Kinshasa on Friday and Saturday . Kabila forces fired in the air and took away some protesters . Government officials said they were later released . The statement announcing the ban said anyone infringing it would be considered an " enemy of the liberation of the people " . It said that the ban would apply until further notice . The United States said on Tuesday it hoped the ban would be short - lived , but did not condemn the move outright . U . S . State Department spokesman John Dinger said : " The United States hopes this will be a short - term ban . Clearly , free political activity is essential as the Congo embarks on a democratic transition , which will lead to elections . " Tshisekedi , citing a 1992 vote in a sovereign national conference in what was then Zaire , has doggedly insisted over the years that constitutionally he is prime minister . Kabila has set up a 13 member government . Aides say he plans to name seven more ministers but not a prime minister .

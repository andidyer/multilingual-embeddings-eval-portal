Heavy rains hit wheat crop in eastern Romania . Heavy rains , hail and floods which swept Romania ' s grain basket areas near the River Danube recently have turned bumper wheat crops into fodder on thousands of hectares , officials and farmers said on Friday . " After so much rain , the wheat crop on 5 , 000 hectares is good only for animals . It ' s such a loss , " said Aurel Plosca , head of the Braigal SA holding in the Danube town of Braila . Heavy rains , hail and floods hit Romania during the grain harvesting season , submerging thousands of hectares of cropland and damaging scores of households . The adverse weather had prompted some experts to say they doubted the accuracy of the Agriculture Ministry ' s estimates of 6 . 9 million tonnes for the 1997 wheat crop , revised downward from 7 . 1 million this week . Bucharest officials , including leading politicians , are sticking to the forecasts despite reports of heavy losses in areas like Braila . They said the experts ' views were groundless and accused them of undermining Romania ' s exports interests . A chart displayed in a Braigal office showed there had been 28 rainy days since June 18 , when wheat harvesting started in the area , one of Romania ' s major grain suppliers . " I can ' t remember anything like that over the past 30 years , " Plosca said , adding that humidity in the soil had prevented the heavy harvesters from entering the fields . On Friday , ponds made by rains on the water - saturated soil marked the landscape alongside the road linking Bucharest to the cropland areas along the Danube . In some areas , sunflower and tobacco crops along the road also looked seriously affected by rains and hail . " Some 560 hectares under wheat as well as other crops are heavily damaged . It ' s a tragedy because people living here are poor and dependent on farming , " said Victoria Ivascanu , Mayor of the small village of Surdila Greci . Plosca said the state - run Braigal was financially safe as it had managed to take in some 35 , 000 tonnes of " excellent " milling wheat which it had already sold to " two Western firms " . Earnings from an earlier sale of 25 , 000 tonnes of barley had also entered Braigal ' s coffers , he said . " We managed to find a buyer for the fodder wheat which we still have to harvest from those 5 , 000 hectares , at a price of $ 90 per tonne , compared to $ 130 we got for the good wheat . " A few km west of Braila , Grigore Ciobica , the head of the private Horticola farming association in the village of Lacu Sarat , said his members had been less fortunate . " It ' s a disaster . This wheat has started to germinate , it ' s finished , " said Ciobica as he walked through the ankle - deep mud in a field of wheat . Ciobica said many residents who had leased land to Horticola had congregated outside his office to ask for their share of " good wheat " . " I ' m not God . What can I do ? " Ciobica said . Earlier in the day , the state radio quoted an official in the county of Constanta saying some 85 , 000 tonnes of wheat stored in silos across the county had started to germinate .

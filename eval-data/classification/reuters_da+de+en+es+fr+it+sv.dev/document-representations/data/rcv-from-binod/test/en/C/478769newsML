HSBC redraws Brazil banking landscape . Brazil ' s banking landscape has been redrawn virtually overnight after Anglo - Asian financial mammoth HSBC Holdings Plc bought out its Brazilian partner in a bid to lead the country ' s retail banking industry , analysts said . With its $ 1 . 0 billion acquisition of Banco Bamerindus do Brasil SA , HSBC has made a major commitment to Latin America ' s biggest economy and will probably force local competitors to rethink future expansion plans , analysts said . " Banks will have to review their strategies to compete with the new player , " said Gilberto Nobre , vice - president at Banco Excel Economico , a bank which itself has shaken the competition with its aggressive approach to clients . " I ' ll bet that at every meeting , at every bank , across the country on Monday , executives sat down to debate how they would face up to their new competitor , " Nobre said . Under a deal announced Wednesday by Bazil ' s Central Bank HSBC assumed 10 billion reais of the former Bamerimdus ' assets and liabilities and estabilished a new bank under the name of Banco HSBC Bamerindus SA . The new bank , a fully HSBC owned subsidiary , opened for business on Monday , and has already announced plans to expand its network to 1 , 500 branches from the current 1 , 206 . Analysts said HSBC will probably shake up Brazil ' s conservative retail banking sector . " For the first time a large bank with recognized international experience in retail banking is entering the Brazilian market , " said Erivelto Rodrigues , analyst at Austin Asis banking consulting firm . Rodrigues pointed out that at an estimated $ 400 billion , HSBC ' s total worldwide assets are nearly equivalent to all of Brazil ' s bank assets . Analysts said HSBC will force Brazilian retail banks to invest in new cost - effective services to keep abreast of the latest in international banking technology . Caught offguard by HSBC ' s surprise entry into the market , board members at some of Brazil ' s most - firmly established banks said they were well - prepared to face the new competition . They said the country ' s banking sector can only win with the presence of the Anglo - Asian bank . " HSBC is undoubtedly a strong competitor . . . In the medium term , HSBC will contribute to make the market more agile , " said Roberto Setubal , president of Banco Itau SA , Brazil ' s second largest private bank . Over the past two years , Brazilian banks have undergone a brutal transformation , which was triggered by the three year - old stabilization plan which slashed inflation and eliminated the banks ' almost risk - free profits . Several small , and even some large and traditional , financial institutions were forced to close doors or merge in an effort to survive . For the banking industry , the positive side of the anti - inflation program was an increase in the average Brazilian ' s purchasing power . Economists estimate around 30 million people have crossed the poverty line since the launch of the Real Plan , increasing demand for credit and banking services . " Those new consumers are the banks ' new target , " Excel Economico ' s Nobre said . Analysts also said HSBC opened doors for new foreign banks to invest in Brazil . " The HSBC move is likely to lead other foreign financial conglomerates to think over opportunities in the Brazilian market , " said Itau ' s Setubal . Opportunities may come with the upcoming privatizations of state banks like Banerj and Credireal . ( ( - - Sao Paulo Newsroom 5511 2485412 ) )

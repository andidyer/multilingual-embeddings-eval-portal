Romania minister to lobby US on early NATO entry . Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Severin , pressing his country ' s bid for NATO membership ahead of talks in Washington , was quoted on Tuesday as saying that leaving Bucharest off the short - list would rob the alliance of a chance to bolster its southern flank . In an interview before embarking for Italy and the United States , Severin said a successful Romanian bid for early entry could help the Alliance seal good ties with Russia and overcome Moscow ' s resistance to NATO expansion . He also offered to forge special ties with Poland to safeguard NATO ' s interests in both the Baltic and the Black Sea and help ex - Soviet Ukraine to integrate within Europe . " A logical enlargement would include the strengthening of NATO ' s most vulnerable flank and that ' s not the Nordic one but the southern one , " Severin said . " In the south there are numerous threats - - terrorism , illegal immigration , the drugs and arms trade . This is the flank that needs strengthening . " Countries on NATO ' s southern rim - - France , Italy , Greece , Portugal , Spain and Turkey - - as well as Canada have backed Romania ' s campaign to be admitted in NATO ' s first expansion to be announced in July . All say the election victory of reformists last year over ex - communists who had run Romania since the 1989 execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu has greatly improved Romania ' s once - remote chances . But neither the United States nor Germany has offered overt backing and Romania , along with Slovenia , still remain long - shots behind Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . Severin said he would assure U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright next week that Romania " is not asking for charity " . But failing to admit Romania , he said , would frustrate millions buffeted by market reforms aimed at closing the growing gap in living standards with many of its ex - communist neighbours . " Frustrated people are less able to withstand the hardships of reforms , " he said . " Without threatening or blackmailing anyone with the destabilisation of Romania , I would say the frustration of the people should be seriously considered . " Severin said Romania had already proved its commitment to maintaining security by sending peacekeepers to Angola , Somalia and Albania and offering a new contingent for the ex - Yugoslav republic of Macedonia . Inside NATO , Romania could " play an important role in contributing to the development of democratic structures and economic stabilisation in Russia " . And Romania and Poland could be " two anchors " in looking after NATO ' s easternmost interests , particularly in guaranteeing Ukraine ' s territorial integrity . Severin said he would be putting to Washington a proposal to secure the supply to Europe of oil and gas from ex - Soviet regions in the Caspian Sea and Central Asia by using Georgia ' s Black Sea port of Poti , Romania ' s Constanta and the Danube . He also suggested that one of the obstacles raised against Romania ' s NATO entry - - a delayed post - Communist treaty with Ukraine - - could be ready within days . Western leaders have praised as a big contribution to easing regional tension Romania ' s signature of a similar treaty with Hungary last year and the inclusion in the new Bucharest government of ministers from Romania ' s large ethnic Hungarian minority .

Sri Lankan Tamil rebels overrun remote police post . Tamil Tiger guerrillas overran a remote police post in northeastern Sri Lanka early on Tuesday , killing at least 15 policemen and guards , military and police officials said . At least 10 other policemen and members of the local militia were wounded in the attack by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels on the Sungawila post in the Polonnaruwa district , 200 km ( 125 miles ) from Colombo , they said . A Defence Ministry spokesman confirmed the rebel attack on the police post but could not immediately give details . Troop reinforcements were rushed to the area , he said . The LTTE was not immediately available for comment . It was not clear if there were any casualties among the rebels , who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the Indian Ocean island ' s north and east . In a separate attack , three rebels and two soldiers were killed in Puttur , in the northern Jaffna peninsula , on Monday when the Tigers ambushed troops , military spokesman Brigadier Tissa Jayatunga said . Navy patrols and air force bombers sank a large rebel boat fitted with four outboard motors the same day off Kachchativu island , in the narrow Palk Strait separating Sri Lanka from south India , he said . The spokesman also said he had no further information on a freighter seized by the navy and escorted to the eastern port of Trincomalee on Sunday . A navy search found the ship ' s cargo hold empty , military officials said . They said they suspected the vessel , with 28 Cuban crewmembers , may have unloaded arms for the LTTE . Cuban Ambassador Rolando Del Amo , who was flown on Monday to Trincomalee , was not available for comment and other Cuban embassy officials declined to comment on the case . The military spokesman said troops advancing into rebel territory in northwestern Mannar were consolidating their positions after a week - long thrust which met little rebel resistance . The LTTE ' s clandestine radio station said the Tigers were ready for a major army onslaught , having acquired new firepower and increased their strength . The government says more than 50 , 000 people have died in the ethnic war , now in its 14th year .

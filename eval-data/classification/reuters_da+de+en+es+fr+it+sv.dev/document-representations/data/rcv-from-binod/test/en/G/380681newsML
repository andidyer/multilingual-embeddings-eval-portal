Peru rebel negotiator enters to start talks . A Peruvian rebel spokesman entered a safe house opposite the besieged Japanese ambassador ' s residence in Lima to start a third round of talks with government negotiator Domingo Palermo , witnesses said . A Red Cross car transported the rebel from the diplomatic residence , where the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) is holding 72 hostages for the 60th day , to the house where Palermo and talks ' mediators were waiting . The rebel was believed to be MRTA No . 2 Rolly Rojas , who has represented the group in two previous rounds of talks this week with Palermo . Minutes earlier , Palermo and mediators had arrived at the site of the residence before assembling and entering the safe house together . The MRTA is seeking to obtain the freedom of some 400 jailed comrades , followed by safe passage to the jungle for the hostage - takers inside the residence . But the government has flatly ruled out this demand . It is unknown what points have been discussed in the meetings other than an agreement to continue talking .

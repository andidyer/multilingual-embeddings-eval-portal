INSTANT VIEW - Malaysia March trade surplus . Malaysia reported a 1 . 75 billion ringgit trade surplus for March against a surplus of 368 . 5 million ringgit in February , the Statistics Department said on Friday . Following are comments from economists and analysts : RAJEEV MALIK , ECONOMIST AT JARDINE FLEMING INTERNATIONAL IN SINGAPORE : This is a mind - boggling figure . This number is definitely positive , much more than what people were expecting . I suspect import growth fell quite sharply ( though I ' ve not seen the figures to confirm that ) . This is related to the ringgit ' s appreciation against the yen in March and domestic side is slowing down lot . In March alone , the ringgit year - on - year is up 16 percent against the yen . The surplus is a surprising one , but the trend will have to reverse , partly because the yen is moving the other way . . ANDY TAN , GENERAL MANAGER , MMS INTERNATIONAL : It ' s much higher than market expectations . We had been looking at a small surplus of 100 to 200 million rinfgit . This is definitely postive data . It looks like the government ' s forecast for the curent account deficit for 1997 should be achievable . In this case export growth was up , but not up to level it was last year . It ' s still being largely achieved at the expense of imports . It shows growth is moderating . Based on that , we can expect growth in the first quarter to come in at just below the eight percent level . JACQUELINE ONG , REGIONAL ECONOMIST WITH I . D . E . AA surplus was expected , but wow ! Normally when Malaysia releases data early , it is usually positive . The data tells us that there is a 38 . 1 percent increase in exports month - on - month . This increase in exports is seasonal , because in February they were slightly down due to festivals ( Moslem Eid al - Fitr and Chinese New Year ) . Some of the exports probably deferred from February are showing up in these figures . On the other hand , import figures show a 28 . 7 percent increse month - on - month , which is also a big jump . In February imports showed a 22 . 2 percent decline , also probably due to the festivals .

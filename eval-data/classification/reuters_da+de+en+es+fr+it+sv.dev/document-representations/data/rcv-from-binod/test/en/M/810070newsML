INSIGHT - Bunds target 102 . 90 if 102 . 51 breaks . September Bund futures on LIFFE have the scope to claw their way up to 102 . 90 short term but must overcome key resistance around 102 . 51 first , technical analysts said on Tuesday . " The outlook for Bunds is getting quite a lot better , " said Marc Ostwald , technical analyst at London Bond Broking here . " For the moment they ' re holding well within the uptrend - - I ' d call it marginally up . " Ostwald said the market had to make a convincing break of a 50 percent retracement level at 102 . 51 before it could have a crack at the upper part of the 102 handle . " It ' s still a question of getting over 102 . 51 - - we got above it yesterday but I ' d like it to close above there to convince we ' re going somewhere , " he said . The 102 . 51 level is the 50 percent retracement of the fall from 103 . 52 on July 23 to 101 . 50 on August 6 . By 0701 GMT September Bunds were down 0 . 03 at 102 . 43 . Ostwald said above 102 . 51 the market would run into resistance fairly quickly at 102 . 63 , 68 , a series of old lows from the end of July that proved to be very good support for the market for a time . " Then if we can break up through there , we get more resistance at 102 . 90 , 92 , some lows and highs from the end of July , " he said . " It probably does have the momentum to do that short term , but we must hold above these levels to make it convincing . " Chase technical analyst Guenter Redeker , said he expected the Bund to extend its recent recovery towards major Elliott resistance at 102 . 63 . But he added in a note that failure below that level would trigger an impulsive move lower , with initial support at 102 . 42 / 38 , then 102 . 19 . Ostwald put support between 102 . 19 and 102 . 22 . " I ' d be surprised if we broke that , but if we did , further big support comes in around 102 . 00 , 102 . 02 , " he said . By 0717 GMT , December Euromarks were up 0 . 01 at 96 . 49 .

Ted Turner owns nearly 1 . 5 percent of New Mexico . Ted Turner , the founder of Cable News Network , bought a 578 , 000 - acre ( 233 , 918 hectare ) New Mexico ranch in a real estate transaction that made him owner of nearly 1 . 5 percent of the state , a spokesman said on Wednesday . The husband of Hollywood actress Jane Fonda owned two other ranches in New Mexico , plus five in Montana and Nebraska . Russ Miller , manager of Turner Ranches , said the latest purchase was the Vermejo Park Ranch , which lies in the shadows of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northeastern New Mexico . The property was purchased from the Pennzoil Corp . of Houston for an undisclosed sum . With its addition to his existing stable of New Mexico properties , Turner ' s total land holdings in New Mexico would equal 1 , 796 square miles ( 4 , 651 square km ) , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported on Wednesday . " It ' s somewhere close to that . It ' s over 1 , 700 , so I ' d say they ' re close , " Miller said when asked to confirm the report . New Mexico encompasses 121 , 336 square miles ( 314 , 236 square km ) of mostly semi - arid land split through its center by mountain ridges . A total holding of 1 , 796 square miles would give Turner 1 . 48 percent . The Vermejo ranch was expected to become the home of up to 4 , 000 bison , Turner ' s livestock of choice . There also will be elk hunting for $ 8 , 500 a week , once the season opens Oct . 4 . Miles of streams will be open to fishing , too , for a price . The ranch ' s 86 - year - old rustic stone buildings are capable of accommodating up to 75 guests .

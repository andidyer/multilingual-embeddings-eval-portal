Israelis bar reopening of shops closed since ' 94 . Hundreds of Palestinians scuffled on Monday with Israeli soldiers who kept them from reopening a Hebron vegetable market closed since a 1994 massacre . Hebron Mayor Mustafa al - Natshe prevented a clash by getting the two sides to agree that a Palestinian delegation would meet Israeli military officials to discuss the peaceful reopening of the shops . The market , a flashpoint of Arab - Jewish violence , was closed after Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein shot dead 29 Palestinian worshippers in February 1994 at al - Ibrahimi mosque in the traditional tomb of the biblical patriarchs . The Palestinians tried to push their way into the deserted market . They carried banners saying " Reopening the vegetable market is a right for Hebronites " . " This demonstration was aimed at urging Israel to implement the agreement which was signed in Taba 10 months ago which stated the market must be reopened , " Natshe told reporters . He said demonstrators formed " a delegation from municipality members , merchants and legislators to discuss with the Israeli military governor the mechanisms to open the market " . Palestinians organised the protest after Jewish settlers seized their shops and started renovating them for use as entrances to a Jewish synagogue near the Avraham Avinu enclave . Since the massacre settlers have papered walls and shops in the market with posters saying : " This is Jewish land . " The decision to reopen the market was made by Palestinian officials and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council . Under an accord with the PLO , Israel agreed to redeploy its troops from Hebron in March but delayed the move after a series of Islamic suicide bombings . Hebron is the only West Bank city with a Jewish settler population . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , elected in May , opposed the Hebron deal made by his predecessor Shimon Peres and says he wants to revise the plan to safeguard about 400 Jewish settlers who live among the more than 100 , 000 Palestinians . Palestinians view a troop withdrawal as a litmus test for Netanyahu ' s intentions on Middle East peace moves and reject any renegotiation of the Hebron agreement .

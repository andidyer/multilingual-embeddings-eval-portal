Kenyan president pardons repentant guerrillas . Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi pardoned two self - confessed guerrillas , who said they had been trained to overthrow his government , when they asked for his forgiveness on Saturday , the Kenyan media reported . Nairobi newspapers on Sunday reported that Moi surprised a rally , attended by thousands in a stadium at Nakuru , 160 km ( 100 miles ) northwest of Nairobi , when he called on other Kenyans who may have been recruited as guerrillas to give themselves up . Television viewers saw pictures of the two men , Anthony Njui and Herbert Lusiola , saying they and other Kenyans had been trained as guerrillas in a neighbouring unnamed country with the aim of overthrowing Moi ' s government . Both men had earlier been charged in a local court with illegal possession of arms , and were awaiting trial . Lusiola , who had previously served in the Kenyan army , told the rally he was recruited four years ago by an underground movement and helped to train other recruits . Witnesses at the rally said the two men were driven away with an escort of security men . Opposition MP Joseph Kimani , who was at the rally , was quoted by local newspapers as dismissing the incident as a propaganda ploy by Moi ' s ruling Kenya African National Union ( Kanu ) party . Moi has in the past accused Uganda of supporting underground groups operating against his country . But he and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni recently supported measures to enhance co - operation between countries in the East African region .

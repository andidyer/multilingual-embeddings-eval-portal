AT & T to announce new WorldNet pricing . AT & T Corp said it plans to reveal a new pricing plan for dial - up versions of its WorldNet Internet access service on Wednesday morning . AT & T currently offers unlimited access for $ 19 . 95 , and officials declined to say what aspects of this would change , though they said that AT & T would announce steps to promote Internet service reliability . Industry analysts said that the structure is likely to change to make the most of the current embarrassment of industry leader America Online Inc , whose service has been congested by too many users . " I don ' t think they have the luxury to make pricing go up , " said one analyst who asked not to be identified . Analysts say AT & T may offer quality of service guarantees to users or perhaps a rebate if users face busy signals . " It would be a tremendous misstep to abandon flat rate pricing , " said Adam Schoenfeld , a Jupiter Communications analyst . " I would hope it is a lower pricing option with some service guarantees , " he added . ( ( Nick Louth , New York Newsroom 212 859 1712 ) )

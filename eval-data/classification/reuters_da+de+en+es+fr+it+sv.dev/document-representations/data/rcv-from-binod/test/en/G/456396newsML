Richardson to press reforms at United Nations . The United States welcomed reforms by U . N . Secretary - General Kofi Annan and will press the world organisation to do even more , U . S . Ambassador Bill Richardson said on Thursday . " The reforms Secretary - General Annan have put in have resulted in a leaner and meaner U . N . , " Richardson said at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing . Reforms Annan announced on Monday included eliminating 1 , 000 U . N . jobs , a $ 123 billion budget cut and consolidating three development departments into one . Richardson said the United States wanted to see more reforms , but he asked Congress to approve paying $ 1 billion in back U . N . dues to give him more influence . " We are pushing reform every day , " he said , but he added , " I need that leverage . " Richardson said if the United States paid the money it owes , he would have a better chance of reducing the U . S . percentage of dues imposed by the U . N . " If I can get some bucks ( money ) for leverage , I can lower the scales , " he told the senators . " Without paying our dues , we cannot go to the U . N . and use our leverage . " Sen . Ernest Hollings of South Carolina , the senior Democrat on the panel , supported Richardson , saying , " We need to back our boys up . " But he added , " I don ' t know where we are going to get the money . " Subcommittee chairman Judd Gregg , a New Hampshire Republican , said he was willing to talk to the administration about U . N . dues but gave no assurances the money would be approved . It was the second day in a row that Richardson , a former Democratic House member from New Mexico , testified on the need to pay back U . N . dues . On Wednesday , he made the same appeal to a House of Represenatives appropriations subcommittee .

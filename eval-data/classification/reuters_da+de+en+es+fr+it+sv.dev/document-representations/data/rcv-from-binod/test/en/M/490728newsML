Polish shares extend gains , seen up on Tuesday . Polish shares rose for the third session running after deep losses early last week and analysts said strong buying after price - fixing and a rise by the WIG 20 index in continuous trade signalled another gain on Tuesday . They said more speculative rises by small - cap stocks could follow on Tuesday and that were enough attractively priced stocks overall to at least keep the market flat . " In each sector it ' s possible to find a firm that ' s undervalued . . . with pretty good growth potential , " said Aleksander Jawien of Polish Development Bank ( PBR ) brokerage , referring to firms ' potential growth this year . Analysts also said their mildly optimistic prognosis was dependent on the lack of significant falls on Western bourses . The main market ' s all - share WIG index rose 2 . 1 percent to 15 , 992 . 2 points and turnover rose 25 . 9 percent to 175 . 1 million zlotys on all three markets . Seven small - caps rose by at least nine percent on Monday , including Swarzedz and Espebepe , both which rose 9 . 4 percent and did not trade after price - fixing due to excess demand . Analysts said players were still speculating on whether Espebepe , with 75 million zlotys in debt , would survive . They said Swarzedz rose on hopes that its meeting with creditors on Monday would result in a debt - restructuring deal . They said Mostostal Export , up 8 . 6 percent in active trade , was likely being helped by the news late last month it would receive a dividend from 69 - percent controlled subsidiary Bankowe Towarzystwo Leasingowe SA ( BTL ) . NFI units rose 3 . 8 percent in a 16 - million - zloty turnover in the regular session and were flat in 15 . 5 - million - zloty continuous trade , where the WIG 20 index rose one percent in 18 . 6 - million zloty trade . - - Steven Silber + 48 22 653 9700

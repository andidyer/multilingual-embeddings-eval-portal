Ellison decides not to buy Apple at this time . Software billionaire Larry Ellison said Tuesday he had decided not to seek control of troubled Apple Computer Inc . at this time . In a brief statement , Ellison , who is chairman of software maker Oracle Corp . , said he may elect to purchase Apple stock for investment purposes or revisit the possibility of acquiring Apple in the future . Ellison has talked for two years of his interest in buying Apple with his own money . Based on current share prices , a purchase of Apple would cost about $ 2 . 1 billion . Last month he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid , and said he was discussing the idea with his friend Steve Jobs , the Apple co - founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part - time adviser to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio . Ellison ' s interest in buying Apple at a time it is struggling to recapture a profitable role in the intensely competitive PC industry , was regarded as a move to prevent Microsoft Corp . from completely dominating the market . Apple was not immediately available for comment .

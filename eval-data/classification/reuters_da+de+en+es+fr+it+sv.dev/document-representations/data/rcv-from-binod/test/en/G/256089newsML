EU failed to support Mostar administrator , EP says . The European Parliament criticised European Union countries on Friday for failing properly to back Hans Koschnick , the first EU administrator of the divided eastern Bosnian city of Mostar . " Mr Koschnick did not always receive the full and unreserved political backing of the ( EU ) Council Presidency and EU foreign ministers , " the parliament said in a report . The EU ministers failed to provide " lasting and effective structures " to supervise the EU administration of Mostar , the first major joint action taken under the EU ' s common foreign and security policy , Euro - MPs said . Ministers also failed to give Koschnick the financial and police back - up he needed to carry out his decisions and they did not even give him a say in selecting the EU administration ' s management team , the parliament complained . The move comes in the wake of a report from the European Court of Auditors , which criticised aspects of the EU ' s administration of the divided city . The EU took over the running of Mostar , divided between Croats and Moslems , in July 1994 . Its mandate expires at the end of 1996 . Koschnick resigned in February this year after failing to sell a plan to reunify the city to the opposing parties . The parliament said the EU treaty was not clear enough about joint actions carried out by the 15 member states . The treaty did not say which responsibilities lay with the national governments and which lay with the European Commission , giving rise to confusion and inefficiency , Euro - MPs said . In future the Commission should be allowed to supervise joint actions without interference from ministers , in order to guarantee their effectiveness , the parliament said . The EU in March appointed the former mayor of the Spanish city of Valencia , Ricardo Perez Casado , to replace Koschnick . Casado was later replaced by his chief of staff , Sir Martin Garrod .

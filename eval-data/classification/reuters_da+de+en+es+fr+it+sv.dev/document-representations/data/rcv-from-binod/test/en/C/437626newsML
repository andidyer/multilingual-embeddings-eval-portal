U . S . ports call Senate bill a good starting point . U . S . maritime ports gave a guarded endorsement to a Senate bill aimed at reforming ocean shipping , calling it a " generally acceptable " starting point for deregulation . The American Association of Port Authorities said that while it did not see the need for any additional deregulation of ocean shipping , the bill , known as the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997 , reflected many of the ports ' concerns . " The Senate bill provides an excellent starting point for discussion of the issues involved in ocean shipping reform , and contains moderate changes generally acceptable to the port community , " AAPA president Kurt Nagle said in a statement . " While the U . S . public port community feels that the 1984 Shipping Act has worked well and does not advocate changes to it , we recognize that some shippers and carriers are seeking more flexibility in their business relationships , " he added . A modified version of legislation that died in the Senate last year , the bill was introduced late Monday by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Republican from Texas who chairs the maritime subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee . The bill would do away with regulatory oversight in certain areas of ocean shipping . Under the legislation , shippers would be allowed to negotiate confidential contracts with individual ocean carriers . Currently , those contracts can only be negotiated through groups of carriers in a geographically - oriented system of conferences . The bill also calls for the Federal Maritime Commission and the Surface Transportation Board to be merged in 1999 into one agency within the Department of Transportation . For U . S . ports , which have been wary that further shipping deregulation could pose a threat to their stability , the latest bill was a more palatable version of legislation introduced in the House in 1995 . " We have to make sure that there is still regulatory oversight , " said AAPA senior vice president Jean Godwin . " There is already consolidation of carriers , and that will continue . . . ( but ) it is possible that extreme deregulation might exacerbate the problem , " she said . ( ( - - W Pollack , New York Commodities Desk + 1 212 859 1640 ) )

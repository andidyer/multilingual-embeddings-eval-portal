OLYMPICS - CAPE TOWN " TOO OPTIMISTIC " ON BENEFITS . Analysts commissioned to assess Cape Town ' s bid to host the 2004 Olympics said on Thursday estimates of the economic benefit to South Africa were too optimistic . The report was " cautiously confident that the Games will not pose an unmanageable burden on the economy and public finance system " . Cape Town , short - listed with Buenos Aires , Stockholm , Rome and Athens for the final International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) vote in Switzerland on September 5 , has promoted its bid as a key to post - apartheid development and economic recovery . However , Bruce Glavovic , coordinator of the team commissioned to assess the bid , told a news conference on Thursday : " The Olympic Games are not a panacea for addressing all our development needs . " In terms of the aim to contribute to the development of the region the Games would be beneficial and affordable if a number of preconditions are recognised and implemented . " The study - - commissioned by the committee managing the Cape Town bid and privately funded - - analyses the economic , social and environmental effects of hosting the Games . " The bid has a number of weaknesses linked to the possibility of the government sustaining a long term net loss , " the report said . The Development Bank of South Africa ' s prediction of a 30 billion rand ( $ 6 . 4 billion ) economic boost and an eight billion rand ( $ 1 . 7 billion ) increase in government revenue could be excessive . The report concluded : " The overall macroeconomic benefits associated with the Games are probably optimistic . " ( $ = 4 . 655 South African Rand )

Dinosaurs tended young like birds , experts say . Meat - eating dinosaurs probably tended their babies something like ducks do today - - sitting on their nests and leading the hatched youngsters about as they fed themselves , U . S . researchers reported on Wednesday . They said their findings added to evidence that some species of dinosaur eventually evolved into modern birds , while others became crocodiles and their relatives . The team of University of Montana palaeontologists studied fossilised nests of the relatively small , 50 kg ( 100 lb ) dinosaur Troodon and oviraptors , which lived about 75 million years ago . Reporting in the science journal Nature , they said the animals seemed to have laid their eggs in pairs and used two methods to incubate them - - sometimes burying them in dirt like a reptile and sometimes sitting on the nest like a bird . " They probably acted like ducks , " said David Varricchio , who worked on the report . " The way the eggs are laid suggest the eggs hatched at the same time . The young probably hung out together . " Living reptiles like crocodiles produce and lay their eggs all at once while birds lay their eggs one at a time . Reptiles usually abandon their nests once laid while birds almost always carefully raise their young . Varricchio said the dinosaurs seemed to fall in between . " Both those dinosaurs are carnivorous dinosaurs - - what we think are close to the ancestry of birds , " he said in a telephone interview . " Herbivorous dinosaurs are like distant cousins . " Researchers do not have much to work with . Dinosaur eggs are rare and only those of a few species have been found . Most notable were the herbivorous maiasaurs , whose nests and eggs , preserved in the Gobi desert , indicated a high level of parental care . The discovery overturned the image of dinosaurs as primitive creatures that carelessly left their young to fend for themselves . " We don ' t have eggs for any other carnivorous dinosaurs , " Varricchio said . " Dinosaurs are really diverse in their shapes and forms and habitat and so we would expect them to have differences in behaviour . "

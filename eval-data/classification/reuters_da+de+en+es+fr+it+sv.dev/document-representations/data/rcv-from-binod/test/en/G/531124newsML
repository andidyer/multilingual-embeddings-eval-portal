SOCCER - JUNINHO WANTS PELE AS CUP FINAL GUEST . Chesterfield ' s dream may have died but Middlesbrough ' s no less romantic involvement with the F . A . Cup remains alive as they prepare for the final against Chelsea at Wembley on May 17 . After the incredible 3 - 3 draw between the two teams at Old Trafford on April 13 , Middlesbrough ' s overseas stars finally overcome the stubborn resistance of Chesterfield ' s honest journeymen 3 - 0 in their semifinal replay at Hillsborough on Tuesday . The victory was masterminded by Brazilian midfielder Juninho who ran the entire match and was unlucky to have a goal disallowed in the first half . Now Juninho wants Brazilian greats like Pele and Zico to come and watch the final and see if Middlesbrough can , after 121 years , win their first major trophy . " It would be a great honour if they can come to the game , " he said afterwards , " and I think it would inspire all of us if they were there . " Pele has said many times that one of the few regrets in his life was that he never played at Wembley and it is odd that Juninho , Emerson and Middlesbrough ' s other big - name foreign players will be making a second trip to Wembley in five weeks . Middlesbrough had never reached a major final before this season but earlier this month they drew 1 - 1 at Wembley with Leicester in the League Cup final before losing the replay 1 - 0 . Now they have a second chance of glory - - at the same time as battling to avoid relegation from the premier league . No team has ever won the Cup and been relegated in the season . " It is very good for Middlesbrough that we are through to the final and very good that we are playing Chelsea , " Juninho said . " The F . A . Cup final will be much better than the League Cup final because Chelsea play football . " It should be an open match but that ' s the English way . I just hope we can win it this time . " So while Middlesbrough prepare for four crucial games in nine days in May - - as well as Thursday ' s league match at Tottenham just 48 hours after their semifinal win , Chesterfield go back to a different kind of reality . Their Cup run , which started in November and included wins over premier league Nottingham Forest and subsequent first division champions Bolton , has focused attention on the town famed only for its bizarre crooked church spire . At one time Chesterfield had a chance of winning promotion to the first division , but the Cup run has all but ended those hopes , although manager John Duncan was not downhearted after his side ' s defeat . " It has been an honour and a privilege to be associated with what we have achieved . Don ' t forget we were 2 - 0 up in the first game and that close to the Cup Final . I just hope we can build on this success and go forward next season . " Chesterfield , who at 131 years of age are the fourth oldest league club in England , have an average home gate of around 4 , 000 , but more than 18 , 000 tickets were sold in Chesterfield for the replay in only six hours . Their fans out - numbered and out - sang Middlesbrough ' s fans at both Old Trafford and Hillsborough and although their team lost they were in no way disgraced . Instead , the Cup Final will have a truly international flavour featuring possibly as many as five Italians , two Brazilians , and assorted Scandinavians as well as players from Romania and France .

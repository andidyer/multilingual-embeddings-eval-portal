Row over Onassis inheritance reaches Greek courts . Trustees of the fortune belonging to 11 - year - old Athina Onassis said on Friday they will fight in Greek courts against her French father Thierry Roussel , who has charged them with breach of faith . Athina is the last surviving member of the Onassis dynasty . Her grandfather Aristotle , who was once married to Jackie Kennedy , made a fortune in shipping and divided it between a foundation in his name and his only surviving child Christina . Christina , who divorced Roussel before her death in 1988 , left her fortune to Athina and appointed a group of trustees from her father ' s foundation to look after the inheritance . " We claim nothing from Mr . Roussel , " Onassis Foundation president Stelios Papadimitriou told a news conference . " But the name of the foundation is marred and this is unforgivable . " The fight between Roussel and the group of trustees looking after Athina ' s fortune moved from the Swiss courts to Greek courts in May when the French businessman sued four leading foundation members for breach of faith . Roussel has sought to take charge of his daughter ' s money in Switzerland , saying he wanted to protect her interests . The dispute over the handling of the inheritance has been brewing for some time but the usually reserved trustees began to speak out this year during court battles against Roussel . " We are enraged , " Papadimitriou said . " Mr . Roussel has nothing to do with us or the foundation and he is meddling in things he knows nothing about . " Roussel could not be reached for comment . Athina ' s exact fortune has not been disclosed but it is estimated at $ 4 . 6 billion , complete with her own Greek island . The Greek court will now decide whether there are grounds for trying the case or whether charges should be dropped , Papadimitriou said .

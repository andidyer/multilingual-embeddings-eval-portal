Spy report embarrasses neutral Swedes . Neutral Sweden , made to blush when it was revealed it had long mistaken swimming minks for Soviet submarines , turned a deeper shade of scarlet on Wednesday when Russia accused two Swedes of spying . An embarrassed silence descended over one of Europe ' s most open governments after allegations erupted in the Russian media that a Swedish defence worker and a senior diplomat in Moscow had been caught spying and expelled from the country . Prime Minister Goran Persson cut short a visit to neighbouring Denmark . His staff said the change was because of urgent labour market talks back in Stockholm . Even Swedish parliamentary leaders protested that they had been kept in the dark about the allegations . Russian media said 32 - year - old Hans Peter Nordstrem had been arrested in St . Petersburg , Russia ' s second city , in February as he took a roll of film from a Russian contact and handed him money . Swedish television news broadcast footage it said showed the Swede - - who is employed by Swedish defence company Celsius - - being arrested in a St . Petersburg museum and hustled away by men dressed in civilian clothes . Nordstrem , interviewed by Swedish television , protested his innocence . " Someone has tried to trick me . The person I was doing business with wasn ' t who he appeared to be . " Swedish officials declined all comment on the matter . " I have no comment to make , " a subdued Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm - Wallen told Swedish television . A colleague at Celsius told Swedish radio Nordstrem was involved in work with the Swedish jet fighter Jas Gripen . Russian media said a senior diplomat at Sweden ' s Moscow embassy had also been expelled after the man was caught spying . The Russian Interfax news agency quoted Boris Kostenko , head of the information department of the Federal Security Service , as saying the man caught in St . Petersburg was a Swedish military intelligence agent . " He confirmed that last winter Hans Peter Nordstrem , a go - between for the Swedish military intelligence , and a Russian citizen who had been engaged by the intelligence earlier had been detained , " Interfax said from Moscow . Kostenko said diplomatic channels had been used after the investigation to make Sweden " withdraw the senior diplomat from Russia " . Sweden has for many years carried out regular expulsions of Soviet diplomats from Stockholm , alleging wholesale spying on its military installations . Stockholm says it does not engage in foreign espionage activities , a claim scoffed at by western intelligence experts , although they say Sweden ' s foreign espionage agents are few compared to bigger countries . A former colleague of Nordstrem ' s at Sweden ' s military defence research organisation FOA said the man had been involved there in underwater hunts for Soviet submarines , most of which - - it transpired last year - - turned out to have been small minks swimming in Sweden ' s waters . An abashed Swedish navy admitted its sonar operators had mistaken the trail of the tiny furry animals for a giant Soviet sub .

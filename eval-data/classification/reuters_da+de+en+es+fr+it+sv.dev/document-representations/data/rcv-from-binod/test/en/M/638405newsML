Australian dlr finds rate relief all too brief . The Australian dollar saw early gains bleed away late Wednesday as relief at the absence of a rate cut failed to translate into offshore demand . Battered bulls managed a couple of muted cheers this morning when the Reserve Bank stayed mum on interest rates and GDP data for the first quarter contained enough signs of strength to stop the money market slavering for an immediate policy easing . But for some , noteably a number of U . S . investment houses , the last cut on May 23 had already been one too many and they were selling again this afternoon , which in turn suggested it was too early to be picking bottoms for this downtrend . By 5 . 00 pm ( 0700 GMT ) the local dollar had deflated to US $ 0 . 7593 / 98 after rising as high as US $ 0 . 7630 this morning when rumours of an imminent rate cut proved wide of the mark . The lapse left it below Tuesday ' s late US $ 0 . 7595 / 00 level , a discouraging result for chart watchers who had to abandon hopes of a squeeze toward US $ 0 . 7670 near term . Instead the risk was for another test of the year low and key support at US $ 0 . 7550 , a break of which would return the currency to territory not visited since February 1996 . That was particularly true given the money market had not given up on its hopes for another official rate cut . Today ' s GDP data were not decisive for the rate outlook either way since those arguing for another easing could point to more recent figures showing weakness , such as April retail trade data last Friday . Nevertheless , the 0 . 9 percent rise reported for March quarter GDP growth was a relief to dollar bulls as market estimates had ranged as low as 0 . 25 percent . Annual growth did fall sharply to 2 . 4 percent from 3 . 1 percent in Q4 but the slowdown was exaggerated as a unusually large 1 . 7 percent gain from Q1 last year dropped out of the calculation . " A close look reveals the recovery has indeed been underway and growth is likely to continue to strengthen , " said Andrew Pease , an economist at Nomura Australia . The main restraining factor on growth had been a big fall in business inventories which shaved 1 . 7 percentage points from expenditure based GDP . In contrast domestic final demand rose a healthy 2 . 1 percent to be 4 . 0 percent up on the year . Treasurer Peter Costello pounced on this point to note that if stocks merely remained unchanged in Q2 they would contribute around 1 . 0 percentage point to GDP growth . Dwelling investment was up a strong 5 . 2 percent and business investment 5 . 3 percent . However , forward looking data last week cast some doubt on whether this growth would last through 1997 / 98 while a shock 1 . 7 percent drop in April retail sales did much the same damage to the outlook for consumption . The GDP figures also confirmed the absence of inflationary pressures , with the GDP - E deflator up 0 . 3 percent on the quarter and a benign 1 . 6 percent on the year . The conclusion of most analysts , therefore , was the data would not stand in the way of the central bank easing again should it feel further insurance on the recovery was needed . " Against the backdrop of soft economic conditions as we moved into Q2 , coupled with a still struggling labour market , a very positive 1997 inflation outlook and ongoing evidence of moderate wage pressures , we rate the chance of another cut as 50 / 50 , " said John Peters , a senior economist at Westpac . On the crosses the local currency was range - bound on the yen at 88 . 50 / 60 from 88 . 30 / 40 late Tuesday . It was firmer on the mark at 1 . 3154 / 66 from 1 . 3067 / 80 as the German currency suffered from doubts over both the timing and credibility of European monetary union . In trade weighted terms the dollar was steady at 57 . 9 . - - Wayne Cole 61 - 2 9373 1818

Indonesia blames Timor disturbances on outsiders . Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has blamed recent violence in East Timor on overseas elements opposing integration of the territory with Indonesia , the official Antara news agency reported on Wednesday . In the past six months there have been several deaths and arrests in protests and guerrilla - related violence in East Timor , a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year . The United Nations , which does not recognise the annexation , is set next month to hold another round of tripartite talks on the territory ' s future with Indonesia and Portugal . " It is true many incidents have taken place in East Timor , but most of them were caused by provocation and under instruction from anti - integration people abroad , " Alatas said in the East Timor capital of Dili on Tuesday . The report neither mentioned any incidents nor named any overseas elements . " If nobody abroad launches a provocation , there would be no incident in East Timor , and it would be easier to solve the problems in the area , " Alatas said during an election campaign visit . Alatas is one of the ruling Golkar party ' s candidates for East Timor in the general election on May 29 for seats in the 500 member House of Representatives ( DPR ) . He is also an appointed representative for East Timor in the larger People ' s Consultative Assembly , which elects Indonesia ' s president every five years .

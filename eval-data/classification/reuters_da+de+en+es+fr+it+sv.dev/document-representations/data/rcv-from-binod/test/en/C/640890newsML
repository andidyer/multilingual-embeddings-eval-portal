Chrysler identifies $ 1 . 2 billion in savings . Chrysler Corp . said Thursday it has identified $ 1 . 2 billion in new cost savings from suppliers so far in the 1997 model year , up from $ 1 billion during the previous year . Chrysler said it will realise about $ 325 million of the $ 1 . 2 billion total in 1997 . The rest of the savings will be realised in future years as the company introduces new models . The savings are the result of Chrysler ' s Supplier Cost Reduction Effort ( SCORE ) campaign , which encourages suppliers to submit cost - saving ideas to the nation ' s third largest automaker . Started in 1989 , SCORE asks suppliers to come up with cost cutting ideas that amount to 5 percent of the supplier ' s sales with the automaker . The programme has become more important as fierce market competition puts pressure on Chrysler ' s and threatens to eat into its fat profit margins . Thomas Stallkamp , Chrysler ' s executive vice president of procurement and supply and head of minivan operations , said said suppliers submit about 100 new ideas each week . " The SCORE programme continues to be unique because cost - savings are shared with suppliers , " Stallkamp said in a statement . " We ' re pursuing quality , efficiency and affordability without eroding our suppliers ' profit margins . " Chrysler spends about $ 38 billion each year to purchase goods and services from suppliers , ranging from toilet tissue to car seats and brakes . The automaker will realise $ 180 million in savings with the launch of its next - generation Dodge Intrepid this fall , said Chrysler spokesman David Barnas . Among the 426 actions implemented were using one catalytic converter instead of three on the previous model ; use of a smaller engine cooling system , and installing lighter - weight material for the front and rear bumpers . Chrysler stock was unchanged at $ 32 . 375 on the New York Stock Exchange .

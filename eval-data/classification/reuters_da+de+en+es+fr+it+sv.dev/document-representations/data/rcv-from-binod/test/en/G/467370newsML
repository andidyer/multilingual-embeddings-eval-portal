France revels in Binoche ' s surprise Oscar win . France savoured on Tuesday Juliette Binoche ' s surprise Oscar win for best supporting actress , the first Frenchwoman in nearly 40 years to capture one of the prestigious Hollywood film awards . Binoche ' s win , for her role in the World War Two epic " The English Patient " , startled everyone , including herself . " I ' m so surprised it ' s true . I didn ' t prepare anything , " she told the audience as she accepted the Oscar . " This is a dream . . . a French dream , " she said . The 33 - year - old star said before the ceremony that she was nervous about attending the gala event , but only because she would have to go on stage as an award presenter . Although the news broke too late to appear in French morning newspapers , it was the top story on virtually every television and radio news broadcast . It also made the front page of influential afternoon daily Le Monde . " Juliette in Oscar country " television network TF1 entitled its adulatory profile . State - owned France 2 devoted more than five minutes of its half - hour midday broadcast to praising the star and her victory . The broadcasters also cheered the victory of Frenchman Gabriel Yared , who won for his original dramatic score for " The English Patient " . The general euphoria drowned out disappointment at the passing over of Patrice Leconte ' s " Ridicule " , nominated in the best foreign film category . It lost out to the Czech Republic ' s " Kolya " . Conservative Culture Minister Philippe Douste - Blazy congratulated Binoche and said her win brought glory to the whole of French cinema . " The Oscar . . . rewards an actress who , with subtle and luminous acting , managed the tour de force of becoming in only a few years one of the greatest of French actresses , " Douste - Blazy said in a statement . Former Socialist culture minister Jack Lang , who headed the Berlin film festival jury that awarded Binoche its best actress award in February for the same role , called her " one of the great prides of French cinema " . " It is a great joy to learn that last evening her immense talent has once again been recognised , " he said . Binoche won for her portrayal of an emotionally - wounded nurse who retreats to a hilltop Tuscan villa to care for a badly - burned patient . The last French actress to win an Academy Award was Simone Signoret , who snared the 1959 Oscar for best actress for her role in " Room At The Top " . Claudette Colbert , who won best actress in 1934 for her part in " It Happened One Night " , is the only other French actress to have been so honoured . Oddsmakers had cast the legendary Lauren Bacall as the easy favourite for her role in " The Mirror Has Two Faces " . For the 72 - year - old Bacall , her role as an ageing beauty and mother to a plain daughter was regarded as the last chance she might have to win Hollywood ' s top honour . " I hope she gets an honour ( ary ) Oscar next year . She deserves it , " Binoche told reporters . Born in Paris , Binoche spent years learning English well enough to play in English - language films . She has had several starring roles in both languages , including in the 1993 French film , " Blue " , as well as in " The Unbearable Lightness of Being " in 1986 and in " Damage " in 1993 .

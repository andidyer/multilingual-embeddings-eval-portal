Swedish PM ' s murder back in media spotlight . [ CORRECTED 16 : 01 GMT ] The unsolved 1986 murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme returned to the spotlight on Thursday after a lawyer revealed a former client told him about a conspiracy to kill Palme and Sweden ' s king . Lawyer Pelle Svensson said his client Lars Tingstrom , known as the Bomb Man after being convicted twice on explosion charges , disclosed on his deathbed in 1993 that he was a part of a gang of four involved in the murder . He told Svensson in a confession , partly written and partly oral , that he planned the murder from his prison cell to take revenge on a society he hated . " It was Lars Tingstrom who ordered the murder . In total there were four people ( involved ) of whom two still are alive , " Svensson told daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter . Svensson told Swedish media the gang of four included Tingstrom , Christer Pettersson , who was convicted of Palme ' s murder in 1988 but later acquitted , a former bank robber and an explosives expert , now dead . But Svensson said the primary target for the group was Sweden ' s king , Carl XVI Gustaf , not Palme . He said it was pure chance that Palme was killed first , shot dead in a Stockholm street in February 1986 ( corrects from 1996 ) after leaving a cinema with his wife . Svensson said it was Tingstrom ' s hatred of society that was the motive for the murder . He claimed he was wrongly convicted when sent to prison for five years in 1979 for sending a letter bomb to a former business partner which exploded in the victim ' s hands . While the court was dealing with the case , the prosecutor started a relationship with Tingstrom ' s fiancee and persuaded her to be a witness against him . In 1982 , the prosecutor ' s house was blown up by a bomb , killing one person , and Tingstrom was imprisoned for life . Svensson said it was while in prison that Tingstrom planned the murders of Palme and the king and knew his three alleged accomplices through the jail system . The police have said new evidence was needed , such as the murder weapon itself , if new charges were to be brought against Pettersson . Svensson has told media he knows where to find the gun .

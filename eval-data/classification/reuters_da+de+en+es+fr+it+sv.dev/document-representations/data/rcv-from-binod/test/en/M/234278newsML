Dollar ends rangebound US session slightly lower . The dollar ended a lackluster trading session modestly lower on Wednesday , as currency dealers took a breather following two highly active and volatile sessions on Monday and Tuesday . " The market is definitely a little shell - shocked , " said Lisa Finstrom , foreign exchange analyst at Smith Barney Inc . " I ' m not quite sure if people knew what hit them earlier in the week . " The dollar ended the day slightly lower against the mark at 1 . 5602 / 07 , down from 1 . 5610 / 20 at the open . Against the yen , the greenback traded in an extremely tight range throughout the day before closing at 113 . 10 / 20 , down from 113 . 27 / 37 in early trade . Yen strength , albeit modest , was the predominant theme of the day , with the Japanese currency pushing higher against most European currencies as well as the dollar . Aiding the yen , were remarks from former Japanese Ministry of Finance official Makoto Utsumi , who reinforced the market ' s conviction that Japanese authorities do not want the dollar to travel beyond its recent highs near 115 yen . Utsumi said on Wednesday that a 105 to 115 yen range versus the dollar was appropriate and an accurate reflection of economic fundamentals in the two countries . " I think you ' ll see the yen continue to strengthen relative to other currencies , " said John McCarthy , foreign exchange manager at ING Barings Capital Markets . " If you think the dollar has room to move up , it ' s going to move up against Europe a lot easier than it is against the yen . " Keeping the dollar in check on Wednesday were weak U . S . asset markets . The Dow Jones Industrials fell over 70 points in the afternoon , before trimming their losses to end the session only 20 points lower . Bonds stumbled lower as well , disappointed when the Federal Reserve failed to add permanent reserves to the banking system , as many in the market had expected . " The bond market came off quite heavily and the Dow Jones industrials were down as well , " said Hans Boman , chief spot dealer at Swedbank . " I think some dollar weakness is related to the bonds and stocks . " The British pound , which tumbled on Tuesday after reports that British exporters were concerned about its recent strength , rose modestly against the dollar on Wednesday , ending at $ 1 . 6428 / 38 against $ 1 . 6407 / 17 at the open . Elsewhere , the dollar was relatively flat at 1 . 3205 / 15 Swiss francs against 1 . 3215 / 25 , and modestly higher at Canadian $ 1 . 3535 / 40 versus C $ 1 . 3508 / 13 at the open . The Australian dollar ended at $ 0 . 8002 / 07 , up from $ 0 . 7959 / 64 in early trade . - - Noah Barkin , 212 - 859 - 1673

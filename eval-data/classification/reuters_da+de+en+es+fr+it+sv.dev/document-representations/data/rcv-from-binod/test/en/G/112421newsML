GOLF - OGRIN USES HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE TO TAKE TEXAS OPEN LEAD . David Ogrin took advantage of his home field advantage to secure a one - stroke lead after the second round of the $ 1 . 2 million Texas Open golf tournament on Friday . Ogrin , who lives nearby and has played the LaCantera course some 50 times , used his intimate knowledge of the 7 , 001 - yard layout to compile nine birdies in a seven - under - par 65 round . The Texan heads into weekend play at nine - under 135 , one stroke ahead of Jay Haas , who fired a 66 . Bob Tway ( 67 ) , budding superstar Tiger Woods ( 68 ) , and overnight co - leader John Huston ( 71 ) were two shots back at 137 . Ogrin put together two impressive streaks , reeling off five successive birdies from the fifth hole , and four in a row beginning at the 12th . " Those two runs made the 65 , " said Ogrin , 38 , who has not won since joining the PGA Tour in 1983 . " It didn ' t surprise me at all that I did this , although 65 is by far my best round on the course . " Haas , a two - time Texas Open winner at its previous venue of Oak Hill , also feels at home at the event ' s new site . Starting his round at the 10th hole , Haas made only one birdie on the back nine , before charging home with five on the front side . Woods , in contrast , blistered the back nine after a sluggish front nine . He dropped two shots on the outward half , primarily as a result of four - putting the sixth green , where he rushed because his group was being timed for slow play . Woods negotiated the back nine in 30 strokes , thanks to six birdies and three pars , to move into the hunt for his second consecutive victory . " Going into the weekend you want to be in with a chance to win , " said Woods , the three - time U . S . Amateur champion who won last week ' s Las Vegas Invitational in only his fifth start since turning professional . Defending champion Duffy Waldorf bogeyed his final hole to miss by one stroke the cut , which fell at one - over 145 .

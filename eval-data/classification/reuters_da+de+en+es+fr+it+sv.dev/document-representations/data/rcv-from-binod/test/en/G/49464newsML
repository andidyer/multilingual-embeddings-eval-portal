FBI declines to call Jewell a bomb suspect . The FBI on Thursday refused to say whether Olympics security guard Richard Jewell was still a suspect in the investigation into the deadly pipe - bomb explosion at the Atlanta Summer Games . Federal investigators had repeatedly identified Jewell , 33 , as one of several suspects in the July 27 attack , which left two people dead and more than 100 injured . But , amid a spate of media reports describing several new suspects not connected to Jewell , FBI special agent Jay Spadafore said he could not comment on the security guard ' s role in the case . " I can ' t comment on that , " he told Reuters . Asked if the change in the FBI ' s public relations approach also signalled a change in status for former police officer Jewell , Spadafore said : " We ' re just not confirming anything . " CBS News said on Wednesday the FBI probe of the bombing had gained pace with investigators focusing on a single suspect and possible accomplices with no ties to Jewell . Other news organisations later quoted unnamed sources as saying new suspects could be linked to the citizens ' militia movement . Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick , asked at the weekly Justice Department briefing about the CBS report , said , " We have said all along that we have more than one suspect and we are continuing to say that . " Attorney G . Watson Bryant , who leads Jewell ' s legal team , said he hoped the latest suspects would receive better treatment than that given his client , who has been hounded for weeks by FBI investigators and the media . " I hope they ( the FBI ) have learned something from the punishment that they ' ve given to our guy . I also hope that they don ' t continue to keep our guy as a suspect simply to deflect attention from the real suspect in this case , " he told Reuters . Jewell ' s criminal lawyer , Jack Martin , filed a new motion in U . S . District Court this week asking that sealed FBI documents detailing the basis of suspicion against his client be made public . A similar request was filed on Sept . 3 , which the Justice Department opposed . All motions have been sealed . Martin said the FBI continued to shadow Jewell ' s movements , but cast the news of other suspects as a reason for hope . " We ' re hopeful , cautiously optimistic and fully expect that at some time the FBI will be able to find out who really did this and that Mr . Jewell will be fully exonerated , " he said . First hailed as a hero for finding the bomb , Jewell has maintained his innocence since he was named by the Atlanta Journal newspaper as a suspect in the bombing . Many other news reports also named Jewell as a suspect and his property was searched by the FBI but charges were never filed against him . Jewell ' s attorneys have repeatedly appealed to federal law enforcement officials to say he was innocent . His mother , in a tearful appeal to President Bill Clinton , asked the government to clear her son ' s name . But no such clearance has come . Federal officials believe Jewell ' s case could be handled like high - profile investigations involving public officials . In such cases , Justice Department officials sometimes say publicly whether there are plans to prosecute a particular individual . Jewell ' s attorneys were not immediately available for comment .

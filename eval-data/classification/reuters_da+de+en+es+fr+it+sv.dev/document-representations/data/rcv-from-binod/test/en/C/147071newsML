Rolls says steam units sale moving forward . British engineering group Rolls - Royce Plc said on Monday that it was satisfied with the level of interest being show in its two large steam power generation businesses that have been for sale since July . A spokesman for the company ' s industrial power group said that , as an enabling move in the ongoing sale process , it will on Friday issue formal notice of potential redundancy to all 1 , 700 staff at the larger unit , Parsons in Newcastle - on - Tyne . " This is a legal requirement to inform the workforce and the Department of Employment that we may have to make redundancies in future if a new buyer does not require the entire workforce or if no new buyer is found , " the spokesman added . Both Rolls - Royce and the Parsons trade unions were fully aware that the so - called 90 - day notice letter did not mean the whole workforce would be made redundant even if there is no sale in 90 days ' time , the spokesman added , as it still had contracts . Meanwhile , Rolls was in discussions with " a number of interested parties under strict mutual confidentiality agreements " and was already at the due diligence stage with some . The group announced in July that it would be seeking either an outright sale or a joint venture partner . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

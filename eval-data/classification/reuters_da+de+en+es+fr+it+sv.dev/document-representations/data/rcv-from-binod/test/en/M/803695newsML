FOCUS - Singapore stocks up on tranche - merger rumour . Singapore ' s beleagured stock market rallied on Friday on rumours the government might scrap a system of dual share listings for strategic blue chip companies . The main benchmark share measure , the Straits Times Industrials Index ( STII ) , surged more than two percent on rises in a range of top firms , including Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) and Singapore Press ( SPH ) . By the 0430 GMT lunchtime close , the STII had recovered to 1 , 935 . 16 points , up 2 . 29 percent or 43 . 39 points on the day but against a peak of just over 2 , 500 points in February 1996 . Fund managers said the gap between the local and foreign listings - - which has been the equivalent of 100 percent of the local share price for some stocks - - was likely to continue to narrow unless the government squashed rumours that dual listings would be abolished . " As it is , the government seems content not to do anything , and as the companies themselves don ' t want to decide , the market itself seems to be deciding for them , " said Lim Eng Hai , head of research at Singapore brokerage J . M . Sassoon . " If the gap narrows far enough the issue will disappear and the companies can formally abolish the distinction without upsetting anyone , " he added . Until last week , 17 local companies deemed strategically important by the government had separate listings for local and overseas investors . These included the four main banks - - Development Bank of Singapore , OCBC Bank , OUB Bank and UOB Bank - - SIA , SPH and the ST group , which controls much of the local defence industry . But the ST group announced on August 8 it would merge the listings for its subsidiary ST Computer Systems & Services and followed this on Thursday by scrapping the dual system for its four other listed units . Analysts said the ST group appeared to have accepted the argument that the dual listing system was inefficient and hampered the development of the market . The Singapore government , through its private investment arm , Temasek Holdings , and other state - run bodies , already controls or owns a majority of the companies with dual listings . " Dual listing is a thing of the past , " said Lim . " And anyway it isn ' t necessary . You could easily allow foreigners to buy local shares , but just not give them voting rights , or keep a limit on their ownership if you wanted to . " Most analysts felt scrapping the distinction between the two listings would benefit the Singapore stock market overall . " In the longer term , it should be positive for the Singapore market because foreign funds will have access to more value here . Buying into Singapore will be cheaper and more attractive , " said Gandhi . - - Singapore Newsroom 65 - 8703305 ; Fax 65 - 7768112 - - Email : singapore . newsroom @ reuters . com

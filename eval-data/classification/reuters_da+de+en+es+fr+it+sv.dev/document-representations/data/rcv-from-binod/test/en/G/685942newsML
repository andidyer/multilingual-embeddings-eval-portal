Philippine troops bomb Moslem rebel positions . Philippine forces on Wednesday bombarded suspected Moslem rebel positions in fighting that has killed at least 32 rebels and five soldiers over the past week , the military said . Armed forces chief General Arnulfo Acedera said up to 100 Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) rebels may have died in the clashes that began nine days ago in the southern Philippines . There was no independent confirmation of the report . About 25 , 000 villagers have fled their homes to avoid being caught in crossfire and have sought refuge in government buildings , Pikit mayor Motin Malingco told reporters . MILF ' s vice - chairman for political affairs , Ghadzali Jaafar , said the army offensive could jeopardise peace talks between the government and the MILF , a hardline group fighting for an Islamic state in the Mindanao region . The MILF , with an armed strength estimated by the military at 8 , 000 men , was not a party to the peace deal signed in September last year between Manila and the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) . The MNLF also fought to separate Mindanao - - the Moslems ' ancestral homeland - - from the largely Christian country but ended up accepting an autonomous area after 24 years of civil war that killed about 120 , 000 people , mostly civilians . Exploratory talks earlier this month between Manila and the MILF failed to make progress . They are to meet again next week . The current fighting began on Monday last week after MILF guerrillas briefly occupied a government power project in nearby Sultan sa Barongis town . Reporters saw helicopter gunships taking off from a hilltop army camp in Pikit to attack rebel positions around Camp Rajamuda , an MILF training facility about 20 km ( 12 miles ) away . Army artillery , directed by a reconnaissance plane , also fired salvos at the MILF targets .

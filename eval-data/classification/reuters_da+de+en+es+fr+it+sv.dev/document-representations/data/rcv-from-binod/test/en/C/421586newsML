INTERVIEW - B . A . T keeps open mind on demerger . Tobacco to financial services group B . A . T Industries Plc is keeping an open mind about a demerger despite newspaper reports that it had ruled it out , said director of public affairs Michael Prideaux in an interview . " We were surprised by media reports that we had ruled out a demerger , " said Prideaux . " We are not convinced that simply doing the splits helps either business much , what we are saying however is we have an open mind . " The company has looked at several options for improving shareholder return over the last year , including merging its financial services arm , comprising mainly general and life insurance companies , with another insurer . In a statement attached to B . A . T ' s full - year results issued earlier , chairman Lord Cairns said , " We continue to evaluate business oppurtunities and issues of corporate structure that will enable us to meet them . " Cairns acknowledged that the company failed to meets its objective of improving total shareholders return in 1996 . B . A . T shares suffered from adverse sentiment over litigation in the United States . Prideaux dismissed the idea of floating off the company ' s U . S . cigarette arm Brown & Williamson as a way of ringfencing the rest of B . A . T from any potential payments to smokers who are claiming damages in a string of U . S . tobacco - related lawsuits . " Tobacco is strategically managed as worldwide business so simply floating off B & W would be a classic way of destroying shareholder value because B & W plays an integral part in developing U . S . international brands around the world , " said Prideaux . " If it became independent you would probably end up with separate sales networks . " Prideaux said the 160 million stg set aside against asbestos claims in the United States should be enough and signal the end of such provisioning . The company set aside 69 million in the fourth quarter and 71 million was taken in the third quarter . The size of the charge contributed to a 20p drop in the company ' s share price to 530p in early trade . " We would hope this would be the end of it , based on the information that is available it certainly should be enough , " said Prideaux . Turning to the outlook for 1997 , Prideaux said underwriting conditions in Britain were unlikely to get any easier , Farmer ' s in the United Statees should continue to make good progress . " On the tobacco side I think the prospect is for further steady progress , " he added . - Tim Farrand + 44 171 542 6437

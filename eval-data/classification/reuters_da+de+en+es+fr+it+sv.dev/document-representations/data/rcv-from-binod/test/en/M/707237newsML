Sofia Commodity Exchange wheat fetches $ 135 / tonne . Bulgaria ' s Sofia Commodity Exchange ( SCE ) said on Friday wheat demand topped supply at this week ' s session and one 500 tonne deal was struck at $ 135 per tonne of wheat ex - works . " Buyers bid for 3 , 000 tonnes of wheat at $ 135 per tonne ex - works , which is may be the highest ex - works price in Europe , but sellers supplied only 500 tonnes , " deputy SCE chairman Hristo Milenkov told a news conference . Bulgaria ' s cabinet said last month that it would set the minimum farm gate price at 230 marks per tonne of wheat from this year ' s crop . " Producers should take advantage of this price immediately as this year ' s wheat yield is seen at 2 . 5 - 3 tonnes per hectare , up from the cabinet ' s forecasts of two tonnes per hectare , " Milenkov said . Agriculture Minister Ventsislav Varbanov said in May Bulgaria needed imports of 1 . 072 million tonnes of bread and feed wheat to cover a consumption gap before the 1998 crop . Excessive wheat exports two years ago and a bad harvest last year created acute grain shortages earlier this year . - - Sofia Newsroom + 359 - 2 981 4145

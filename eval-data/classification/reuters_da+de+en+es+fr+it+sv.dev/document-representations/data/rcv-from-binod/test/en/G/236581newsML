Serbia ' s Milosevic offers hand outs to end protests . Serbia ' s socialist government stepped up efforts on Thursday to take the steam out of street protests by launching a purge of accused party officials and promising cash for students and pensioners . The moves followed assurances to the United States that force would not be used to quell 18 days of demonstrations and promises that the nation would get cheaper electricity . President Slobodan Milosevic , who scores of thousands of demonstrators in Belgrade want to step down , has begun a purge of socialist officials blamed for rigging election results against the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition . Zajedno leaders claim the ruling socialists overturned opposition victories in Belgrade and other towns on November 17 . Milosevic was reported to have accepted the " resignation " of the socialist boss in the southern town of Nis where blatant stuffing of ballot boxes with socialist votes triggered the first protests . Belgrade newspapers said Serbian Information Minister Aleksander Tijanic , a stalwart of Milosevic ' s administration , had also resigned . Other high - ranking officials in the capital and provinces were expected to be sacrificed as Milosevic moved to distance himself from the main culprits . The government announced it would start paying out student grants later this month and that pensioners would finally receive their October payments plus a bonus . Cheaper electricity was an important concession with the onset of winter . Students , encouraged by Western support led by the United States , began another big march in Belgrade to be followed by a rally in the city centre where a record 120 , 000 protesters assembled on Tuesday . Zajedno leaders said the resignations showed Milosevic was in trouble and said they would stick by their demands for a confirmation of their electoral victory . " He is having a difficult time . He doesn ' t know what to do with us , " said Vesna Pesic , head of the Civic Alliance , one of three parties in the Zajedno coalition . She told Reuters the resignations would not satisfy an angry population . " Our economy is destroyed and our living standard keeps going down . . . There ' s an accumulation of dissatisfaction . " With the protests showing no sign of flagging , Milosevic ' s foreign minister promised U . S . officials that the rallies would not be crushed by force . A crackdown on independent media and police threats against the demonstrators have prompted an avalanche of diplomatic protests . The European Union issued a statement saying it " deplored " the closure of independent Belgrade radio B - 92 . Law professors came out in support of student protests demanding authorities overturn poll fraud . Some 100 professors at Belgrade ' s law faculty unanimously decided on Wednesday night to suspend classes as long as the student protests lasted , a professor who asked not to be named told Reuters .

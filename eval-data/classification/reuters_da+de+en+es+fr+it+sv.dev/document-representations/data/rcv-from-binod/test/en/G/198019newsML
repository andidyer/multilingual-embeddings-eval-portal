Britain expects to go ahead with Zaire force . Britain said on Monday it expected to go ahead with a planned peace force deployment to Zaire despite the unexpected return home of half a million Rwandan Hutu refugees . Defence Secretary Michael Portillo said he was awaiting a report on Tuesday from a British reconnaissance team to Zaire before making a final decision . But he said Britain was concerned that hundreds of thousands of refugees , particularly in the Bukavu area , were still unaccounted for . " So far , as far as we know , the refugees in the area where we are intending to go are still infested with the armed militia who are preventing them from going home and terrorising them and therefore still in danger of starvation . " And therefore until I hear from the reconnaissance team I have to assume that our operation , our part of it , has got to go ahead , " Portillo told BBC radio in an interview . Portillo was responding to reports that some other nations , particularly the United States , were having second thoughts about the need for multinational military intervention in Zaire . The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR estimated on Sunday that 400 , 000 Hutus had already returned to Rwanda from eastern Zaire and 100 , 000 more were moving to the border . Aid agencies say some 500 , 000 other refugees are in the Bukavu area of eastern Zaire . Thousands of Zaireans have also been displaced by the fighting . " The situation clearly has changed but it hasn ' t changed totally , " Portillo said . " We still have a lot of people unaccounted for and so just therefore before we heave an international sigh of relief and decide we needn ' t actually do anything about this , we ' d better check the evidence a bit more thoroughly , " he said . U . S . Defence Secretary William Perry said on Sunday Washington had yet to make a firm decision on participation . " We are not the Salvation Army , " he said in a television interview . Countries who expressed their intention to join a multinational force will meet on Wednesday at the U . S . military ' s European headquarters in Stuttgart , Germany , to review the situation .

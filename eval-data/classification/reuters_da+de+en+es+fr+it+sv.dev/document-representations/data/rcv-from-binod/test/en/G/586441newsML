O . J . Simpson grilled on his financial assets . A lawyer attempting to collect millions of dollars in damages from O . J . Simpson accused the ex - football star on Thursday of being less than truthful about his assets . Simpson ' s questioning by lawyers for the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman also turned nasty when Goldman ' s father called him an " asshole . " The so - called " debtor examination " was to find out how much money Simpson has available to pay a multi - million dollar damage award against him . Simpson was found not guilty by a criminal jury in 1995 of the June 12 , 1994 , killings of his ex - wife and Goldman , but was found liable for their deaths this year in a civil case . The jury in that case awarded the families $ 33 . 5 million . Simpson said Fred Goldman used the epithet against him shortly after the two , accompanied by their lawyers , entered the hearing room . " He called me an asshole , " Simpson told reporters , adding he forgave Goldman for his outburst . " The man lost his son . He should be excused for whatever he does . " Asked about the incident , Goldman said , " You ' re damn right I called him an asshole , because he gave me a real dirty look . " Simpson appeared for Thursday ' s closed - door hearing wearing slacks and a beige golf shirt . Notably absent was his wristwatch and jewelry . A source close to the case said he could have been forced to surrender them had he worn them . The acrimony between Simpson and Goldman quickly spread to the lawyers with Daniel Petrocelli , who represents the Goldmans , coming out of the hearing room within two minutes to complain to Judge David Perez about Simpson ' s " complete lack of candor " in discussing his financial affairs . Petrocelli also complained that Simpson ' s attorney , Ronald Slates , was attempting to obstruct his questioning of Simpson . Petrocelli complained on a second occasion that Simpson and Slates were refusing to hand over Simpson ' s cancelled checks and bank records . Perez ordered Simpson ' s financial and personal attorney , Leroy " Skip " Taft , to bring them to court . Later Petrocelli told reporters the questioning of Simpson was " going very slowly and could take many more days . " " Mr . Simpson professes to have a complete lack of knowledge about any of his financial affairs . I ' m getting a lot of ' I don ' t knows , ' " Petrocelli said . Simpson , whose mansion is in foreclosure , claimed during his civil trial that he was broke . Following the trial sheriff ' s deputies carted away jewelry , furs , silverware and Tiffany lamps and took them to a warehouse where they were being stored pending their distribution to the families . Missing , however , was Simpson ' s Heisman Trophy , awarded to the best college football player in the nation , and his expensive sports utility vehicle in which he was driven to court by a bodyguard during the civil trial . Simpson told reporters outside the Santa Monica courthouse on Thursday that when he returned home after spending 16 months in jail during his criminal trial , the Heisman Trophy was missing and he had no idea where it was . " That ' s nothing but the truth , the whole truth , so help me Jesus , and I ' m Christian , " he said . Earlier Simpson told reporters before the hearing that a reported move to Florida had been planned before the 1994 deaths of Nicole Simpson and Goldman .

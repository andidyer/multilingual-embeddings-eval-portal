BT Japan unit says aims to double revenues . British Telecommunications Plc ' s Japan unit said on Thursday it aims to nearly double revenues to $ 176 million over the next two years . British Telecom ' s Japanese unit BT Network Information Service ( BT NIS ) aims to achieve $ 97 million in revenues in the year that started April 1 . " One of BT ' s highest company - wide priorities is success in the Japanese market , " John Jarvis , the chief of BT ' s Japanese unit , told a news conference . BT in March streamlined its Japanese operations , combining its existing joint venture , NIS , and BT group ' s Japanese unit , BT Japan , to provide domestic and global communications services . BT NIS is owned 51 percent by BT and 31 percent by Marubeni Corp . The remaining 18 percent is owned by 19 other companies . BT ' s planned merger with MCI Communications Corp MCIC O , the second biggest U . S . telephone company , will create a global giant with combined annual revenues of $ 42 billion , but some analysts have highlighted a need for the merged group to bolster its presence in Japan and elsewhere in Asia . Alfred Mockett , managing director of another BT unit , BT Global Communications , said BT ' s expanded activities and investments in Japan would help to strengthen its ties with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp ( NTT ) , which BT is openly courting for an alliance . " Many opportunities exist in Japan , not the least of which is our relationship with NTT and the joint venture we have formed for the licence in Singapore , " Mocket told the news conference .

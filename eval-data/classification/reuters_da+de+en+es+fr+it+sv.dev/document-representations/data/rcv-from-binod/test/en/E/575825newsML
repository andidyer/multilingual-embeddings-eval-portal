Chile spurns Mercosur , seeks Americas free trade . Chile considers free trade across the Americas a higher priority than South America ' s Mercosur customs union , Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said in an interview published on Monday . On the eve of a ministerial meeting in Brazil on regional free trade , he told Brazil ' s O Globo daily that Santiago would not seek to become a full member of Mercosur , which groups Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay and Paraguay . " Partly because of macroeconomic circumstances , we do not want to be part of Mercosur at this stage , " Aninat said . " We consider a priority the establishment of a large area of free trade in the Americas , which is the higher objective of the FTAA ( Free Trade Area of the Americas ) . " Trade and foreign ministers from 34 countries in the region are arriving in the Brazilian industrial city of Belo Horizonte for the third ministerial conference on setting up the FTAA . The project , launched in Miami in 1994 , foresees a free trade area of one billion potential consumers stretching from Alaska to Patagonia . Chile ' s endorsement of the FTAA over Mercosur is likely to be seen as a sign of support for the U . S . position in an argument with Mercosur , led by Brazil , which says its priority is to strengthen and expand Mercosur . Aninat , whose country has signed an associate agreement with Mercosur , said he was still betting on Chile eventually joining the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) that groups the United States , Canada and Mexico . Chile ' s entry to NAFTA has been delayed because the U . S . Congress has not granted the Clinton administration so - called " fast - track " authority to negotiate trade deals . The Belo Horizonte FTAA meeting was due to begin Tuesday with a businessmen ' s forum , followed Thursday and Friday by ministerial negotiations expected to map out the structure and timetable of formal negotiations . All agree talks ought to begin after a presidential summit in Santiago , Chile , next March . The United States , backed by Canada , wants to discuss issues ranging from tariff reductions to subsidies at the same time . Brazil demands more structured talks , with tariff reductions preferably left till last .

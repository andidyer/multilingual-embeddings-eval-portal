Argentine stocks close down 0 . 23 pct . Argentina ' s blue - chip Merval stock index closed down 0 . 23 percent Friday at 809 . 93 after late - session profit - taking eroded earlier gains , traders said . The Merval was modestly higher than Thursday ' s close for most of the session , bouyed by selective buying tinged with caution before next week ' s U . S . Federal Reserve meeting . At one stage , it was 0 . 72 percent up from the previous day . " The market has begun a period of correction which could last a few weeks , " said one trader , " We see support for the Merval at 770 to 780 points . " He added , " There is caution about the Federal Reserve . . . Institutional investors will stay on the sidelines . " Traders singled out steel stocks , which are being helped by good prices , and construction stocks riding the wave of economic expansion , as good buys . Turnover rose to $ 36 million from $ 29 million Thursday . A total 89 stocks were traded , with 28 closing down and 31 up . Most local analysts feel the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged after its meeting next week , but they add that a 25 - point rate hike would not be a problem for emerging markets at a time of bountiful world liquidity . But traders said they thought the prevailing caution would mean the market opening quietly Monday , with low volume and little volatility . Biggest Merval losers Friday were gas pipeline firm Transportadora Gas del Sur , down 2 . 63 percent , and Banco Frances , down 2 . 22 percent . The biggest gain was posted by car firm Ciadea , up 1 . 86 percent . The MerVal fell 1 . 0 percent to close at 811 . 83 Thursday , on volume of $ 28 . 7 million . The Merval had closed 0 . 6 percent lower Wednesday after slipping off a five - year high of 830 . ( ( - - Jorge Otaola , Buenos Aires Newsroom + 541 318 - 0651 ) )

S . Korea upholds sentences for Chinese mutineers . South Korea ' s Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence on the ringleader of a gang of Chinese mutineers for killing the captain of a fishing boat and 10 crew , a court official said on Saturday . The court also confirmed life imprisonment for his five gang members , he said . The six , all of Korean descent , had appealed against their sentences handed down in April . The high court had found them guilty of murdering the South Korean captain of a tuna boat along with three Indonesians , six South Koreans and an ethnic Korean Chinese in a mutiny in the South Pacific last August . The revolt was apparently sparked by harsh working conditions . The high court had commuted original death sentences for five of the mutineers to life imprisonment , but the ringleader ' s sentence stood . Police said the six had dumped the bodies overboard . One South Korean navigator and six Indonesians survived the attack . The case was brought to light when Japanese maritime police found the Pescamar No . 15 drifting without fuel south of Japan . " Their brutality is difficult to be viewed as an act of a human being , " the Supreme Court said of the defendants in a statement . " Therefore we are rejecting the appeals . "

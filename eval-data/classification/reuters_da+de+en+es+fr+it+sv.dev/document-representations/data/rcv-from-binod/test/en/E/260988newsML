Russian central bank gold reserves up to 400 T . Russia ' s central bank bought about 100 tonnes of gold in 1996 , boosting its reserves to around 400 tonnes , the bank ' s precious metals department chief , Sergei Kyshtymov , told Reuters on Tuesday . Russia ' s gold output for 1996 is forecast to slip to 110 tonnes from 122 tonnes in 1995 and 132 tonnes in 1994 . The central bank says it plans to liberalise the domestic gold market to channel commercial bank funds into output , but the necessary laws have yet to be passed , including measures that would allow banks to export gold freely . - - Artyom Danielyan , Moscow newsroom ( 095 ) 941 8520

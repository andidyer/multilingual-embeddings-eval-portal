U . N . envoy meets Brazzaville rivals , truce holds . U . N . special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun flew into the Congo Republic ' s battered capital Brazzaville on Tuesday and held talks with the warring parties , both parties said . Residents said a fragile ceasefire , which took effect at midnight , held despite a brief dawn burst of shellfire . Sahnoun began his visit with talks with Lissouba , who has been locked in a bloody showdown with his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso for over a month . He met Sassou later . Sources close to mediation efforts said Gabon ' s veteran president , Omar Bongo , had invited the two sides and Brazzaville mayor and national mediator Bernard Kolelas to peace talks in his capital Libreville . It was not clear whether Lissouba and Sassou would attend . " The first step is for the representatives to negotiate the principle points . After that , if the ceasefire is consolidated , we will see whether the two men can meet , " one source close to the talks said . The timing was not immediately clear . Former military ruler Sassou and Lissouba have both put their names to the truce , proposed by Bongo , to end political and ethnic clashes that have killed hundreds of people . Earlier truces have held a day or so but have disintegrated into fresh mortar and rocket exchanges which have put tens of thousands of civilians to flight and devastated the capital of the oil - producing former French colony . Sahnoun , who helped negotiate the truce , said on Sunday the talks would focus on national reconciliation and creating an environment for a presidential election in the next two months . Plans are taking shape for a U . N . - sponsored , mainly African peacekeeping force . The bloody showdown began on June 5 when soldiers surrounded Sassou ' s home as part of a crackdown on private militias ahead of a now - postponed July 27 presidential election . Lissouba , Sassou and Kolelas , whose militia have kept out of the latest fighting , planned to contest the July 27 election . Lissouba ' s mandate expires at the end of August . He says the constitution allows a 90 - day extension to organise elections . Sassou demands a national salvation government . Kolelas ' s militia was at the heart of similar political and ethnic clashes that killed at least 2 , 000 people in Brazzaville after a disputed 1993 parliamentary election .

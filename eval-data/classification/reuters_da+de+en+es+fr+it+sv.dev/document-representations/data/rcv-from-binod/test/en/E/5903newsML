Analyst sees August S . Africa CPI rising to 7 . 7 pct . South African consumer price inflation is likely to rise to 7 . 7 percent year - on - year in August from July ' s 7 . 1 percent and June ' s 6 . 9 percent , Huysamer Stals economist Johan Roussouw said on Wednesday . But the average inflation rate for 1996 should be held in check at 7 . 4 percent , down from 8 . 7 percent 1995 , despite cost pressure resulting from the fall in the rand . He predicted December 1996 CPI of about 9 . 3 percent . July inflation , which came in in line with Roussouw ' s own forecast and a Reuters ' consensus poll , was driven by rising food prices - - and a similar pattern is likely next month . Roussouw said the food component was likely to see a 1 . 5 percent month - on - month increase , the same as in July , lifting August ' s year - on - year increase in food prices to 7 . 7 percent from 4 . 8 percent in July . The non - food component of CPI should show an unchanged month - on - month rate of increase of 0 . 6 percent in August , taking the year - on - year rate to 7 . 74 percent , he added . - - Johannesburg newsroom + 27 11 482 1003

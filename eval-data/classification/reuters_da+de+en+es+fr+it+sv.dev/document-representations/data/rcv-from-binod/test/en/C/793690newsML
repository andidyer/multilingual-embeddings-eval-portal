JAPANESE FIRMS JOSTLE TO BUY CHILE COPPER MINES . Facing rising competition for copper concentrates to fuel their smelters , Japanese metals companies are pushing to buy stakes in Chilean copper mines to guarantee future supplies , said mining officials . " Securing copper concentrates for smelters is becoming difficult so we need to have a definite source by having a share in the ownership of a mine , " said an executive at one Japanese mining company who declined to be identified . The Chilean owners of the huge Los Pelambres copper mine agreed to sell a 40 percent stake in the project this year to two groups of Japanese metals firms headed by Nippon Mining & Metals Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Materials CorpThe $ 256 million deal is the largest stake bought by Japanese investors in a copper project here and singlehandedly doubles Japan ' s investment in Chile ' s mining industry . " The Japanese are beginning to enter the mining business here and are not only willing to accept contracts , " said Marco Fluckiger , head of the foreign investment department at state copper studies center Cochilco . The Los Pelambres deal comes hot on the heels of a decision by Nippon Mining and Mitsui & Co to buy a 12 percent of the Collahuasi copper mine , the largest project currently being built in Chile . The Japanese investments are part of a growing interest among Asian metal companies in gaining a foothold in Chile whose northern Atacama Desert holds much of the world ' s known copper reserves . South Korean industrial giant Hyundai is studying building a smelter and refinery here , while Chinese miners have long hankered after a link - up with state copper giant Codelco . Competition among firms to buy into Los Pelambres , owned by Chile ' s Luksic group , was fierce , said mining officials . The battle was sparked by concerns of a shortage of concentrates , as mining companies focus their efforts on producing cathodes using heap - leaching technology which is cheaper and cleaner than the traditional concentrator . " Although copper concentrate production is rising , the main increase is in SX - EW ( heapleaching ) , which means competition for buying copper concentrates is tighter than before , " said the Japanese official . Los Pelambres , which will be one of Chile ' s largest private concentrate producers , will produce around 230 , 000 tonnes of copper a year when the expansion is completed in 1999 . It currently produces just 23 , 000 tonnes a year . As part of the Los Pelambres deal , the pit ' s Japanese owners will buy 400 , 000 tonnes of copper concentrates a year out of a total of 740 , 000 tonnes under a 12 - year supply contract . The increase in Japanese investments in copper pits will mean that within the next three years around 70 percent of concentrates supplied to smelters will come from integrated mining operations , compared with around 30 percent today . Local mining officials said the Japanese enthusiasm was also due in part to a profits squeeze at their traditional smelting and refining businesses . " They want a percentage of a riskier , higher profit investment , " said one local official . " The smelting business has very small margins . Mining - - when it works - - has high margins . " Los Pelambres is 25 - percent owned by a consortium including Nippon Mining & Metals Co Ltd , Marubeni Corp , and Mitsui & Co Ltd . A second group including Mitsubishi Materials Corp and Mitsubishi Corp owns 15 percent of the pit . Japanese firms are not only interested in projects ready to develop , but are beginning to carry out higher - risk exploration at some smaller deposits . One example are Japanese companies Nittetsu and Itochu Corp which prospected with Chilean group Cominor at the El Bronce property . The companies recently agreed to go ahead and build a copper mine at the site . " Apart from Cominor , the Japanese have always entered with a feasibility study already prepared , " said Fluckiger .

Seita set to close a plant , expand another . French tobacco company Seita said on Thursday it was likely to shut a factory making dark tobacco cigarettes in Chateauroux in western France next year because of a continuing decline in sales of these cigarettes . It said about 300 jobs were concerned but it expected to be able to offer some 200 staff aged under 55 years the possibility of a job at another plant in Nantes on the western coast and that other measures would be envisaged for those of 55 and over . The group said in a statement blond tobacco sales would help to make up for a structural decline in dark tobacco consumption and that the Nantes plant , which makes the former , would thus be in a position to take on more staff as it raised production . The Communist - led CGT union said in a separate statement that it and the other trade unions were opposed to a plan which had been presented to them as fait accompli and would therefore challenge it .

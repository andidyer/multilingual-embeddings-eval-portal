UK natgas strengthens again , next winter dominates . The UK spot natural gas market continued to strengthen on Tuesday , traders and brokers said , with the coming winter dominating trade as several deals were done in the fourth and first quarters . There was also some interest for May and the immediate prompt period , although the volume of trade getting done here is now slipping . A dealer said that " May interest has been cleared out . " The volume of trade was relatively high once again , as it has been for several days , the result of the higher prices according to dealers . " When the market moves up , it triggers a lot of risk management tools , " said one . " There ' s a lot going on as the market ' s finally moved into new territory , " said another . But although the volume of trade was reasonably high , some doubted that there were many players actively involved . " The whole market is moving up . I don ' t know how many people are buying it . A lot are selling and a lot are standing back , " said a trader . Apart from the coming winter , there was also good interest for next summer and for gas years , with the years from October 1997 and October 1998 both getting done , as was the calendar year 1998 . As in the last few days , there was significant volume done at St Fergus , with some players surprised by the relatively high prices achieved there . On the IPE futures market trade was once again slow , with only 80 lots done in seven trades . January , February and March all traded higher , in line with the physical market , while May settled at 10 . 60 pence on the last day of trade . The May contract has moved from a high of 12 . 80 pence to a low of 9 . 80 since it started trading in January . Transco forecast a temperature of 12 . 9 Celsius on Wednesday , above the seasonal normal level of 11 . 2 Celsius , with demand expected to reach 196 mcm , 46 percent of peak day demand . - - Sebastian Alison , London Newsroom , + 44 171 542 6412

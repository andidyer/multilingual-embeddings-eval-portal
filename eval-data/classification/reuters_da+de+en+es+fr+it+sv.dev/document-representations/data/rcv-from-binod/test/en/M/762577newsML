Venezuela bolivar ends weaker at 466 / 467 / dlr . The Venezuelan bolivar closed sharply weaker at 496 . 00 / 497 . 00 per dollar Tuesday in heavy corporate and interbank currency demand fueled by excess liquidity and expectations of further depreciation , traders said . The bolivar closed at 494 . 50 / 495 . 50 Monday . Traders said currency markets had been surprised by the extent to which the Central Bank had allowed the bolivar to slide in recent sessions . The local currency , which depreciated just 2 . 5 percent in the first half of the year , has slipped four bolivars ( 0 . 8 percent ) against the dollar in the last five sessions . " We ' re only three bolivars from the 500 barrier which could have a psychological and economic impact , " one trader said . Central Bank President Antonio Casas Gonzalez insisted earlier Wednesday that despite the more accelerated slide of the bolivar in recent days the exchange rate was well within limits set by the Central Bank and that there was no reason for markets to panic . " What we want is for the bolivar not to become overvalued , but we are within the bands , " Casas said . Officials have pointed out that the Bank has a comfortable level of foreign reserves - - more than $ 16 billion - - with which to defend the currency is necessary . Traders said the strong currency demand would continue Wednesday particularly if rates of Central Bank TEM bills fall at the weekly auction . Venezuela ' s foreign exchange market is unusual in that the Central Bank is its largest single supplier of dollars , which blurs the difference between the Central Bank supplying liquidity and intervening .

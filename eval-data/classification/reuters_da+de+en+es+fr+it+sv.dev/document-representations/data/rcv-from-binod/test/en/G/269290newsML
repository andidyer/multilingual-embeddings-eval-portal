West debates catching Bosnia war crimes suspects . The international High Representative to Bosnia confirmed on Friday that Western powers were taking a fresh look at how to arrest indicted war criminals in former Yugoslavia . Carl Bidlt , who oversees the civilian side of the Dayton peace agreement , said countries attending this month ' s international conference on Bosnia decided to give a higher priority to the prosecution of war crimes . " I think it ' s fair to say a shift ( in policy ) is under way and has been under way for some time , " he told a news conference . Bildt ' s comments followed reports that NATO defence ministers and U . S . officials were considering setting up an international " police force " that would track down war crimes suspects still at large . Bildt , who has called on Western governments to send specially - trained units to detain indicted war criminals , declined to give any details of what options were under consideration . " The parties know that at some point in time some action will be taken . But it is in the nature of things that it will not be announced in advance , " he said . He hinted that the mere threat of hunting down war crimes suspects might force Serb and Croat authorities to cooperate with the U . N . war crimes tribunal in The Hague . " I would hope that before anything comes out of that there would be developments by the parties themselves and by the relevant authorities and that is clearly the aim of certain activities , " he said . Only a handful of nearly 80 suspects have been extradited and Western countries say only Bosnia ' s Moslem leaders have cooperated with the tribunal . Those still at large include former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and former Serb army commander Ratko Mladic . NATO ' s top commander in Europe , General George Joulwan , also said alliance countries were debating how to address the failure of Balkan leaders to extradite war crimes suspects . " The political guidance has to develop and that guidance is developing now . I think we have to wait and see what direction it takes , " Joulwan , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe ( SACEUR ) , told reporters . Joulwan , who flew to Sarajevo to preside over the launching of a new 18 - month peacekeeping mission in Bosnia , said NATO commanders still believed that tracking down war crimes suspects was not a job for the muiltinational force . Detaining those indicted by the U . N . tribunal was a " police task " and the peacekeeping troops were not a " police force " , he said . " I believe it ' s still being discussed and will continue to be discussed , " he added . " And when that political will , political guidance is there I will receive instructions and act accordingly . "

Dollar fails to recapture 1 . 74 marks by U . S . close . The dollar rose broadly on Friday as investors shunned marks and bought dollars amid speculation Europe ' s planned single currency would be launched on time but likely be weaker than previously thought . Comments from officials attending a Franco - German summit on Friday suggested an agreement was imminent on a European Union stability pact which will outline budgetary requirements for members of Europe ' s proposed single currency , the euro . Earlier this week , the mark benefitted from speculation the European nations would not agree to the pact at a key EU summit beginning in Amsterdam on Monday , suggesting the January 1999 launch date for the euro could be postponed . " The dollar gained from continued expectations in the market that there is going to be some kind of an agreement within the EU nations this weekend that will probably lead to a slightly weaker euro , " said Stephen Jury , chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland . The dollar rose to 1 . 7360 / 70 marks from 1 . 7302 / 07 at the open and gained to 114 . 80 / 90 yen from 114 . 40 / 45 . Casting doubt over the timing and ultimate strength of the euro was the newly - elected Socialist French government ' s recent insistence on an inclusion of a more pro - employment bias to the stability pact . France ' s Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said the French government ' s demands for a focus on economic growth and jobs must be given the same importance as the limiting of budget deficits . " We ' ve got a situation where the uncertainty surrounding the European Union meeting has weakened the mark . It ' s a bit of safe - haven buying directly related to that uncertainty , " said Dennis Pettit , foreign exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan . The dollar initially weakened in early trade on news U . S . producer prices fell slightly in May rather than rising as Wall Street economists had forecast . The price data hinted Federal Reserve policymakers would not raise interest rates at their upcoming July meeting , thus weakening the U . S . currency . However , a surge in U . S . stocks and bonds on the soft price figures and more benign interest rate outlook quickly reversed the dollar ' s direction . " Because asset markets are doing well , that supports the dollar as opposed to the negaive side of the PPI numbers which is lack of interest - rate support for the dollar , " Pettit said . The Labor Department reported the Producer Price Index dropped 0 . 3 percent in May , marking the first string of five declines in 45 years . The Dow Jones industrials index gained 71 points to close unofficially at 7782 while the 30 - year U . S . Treasury rose 19 / 32 to yield 6 . 73 percent . On Friday , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Finance Minister Theo Waigel met French President Jacques Chirac , Jospin and Finance Minister Dominique Strauss - Kahn . Their remarks all pointed to progress on an agreement at or before Monday ' s Amsterdam summit , but that further work was needed . All said they want European monetary union to start on time in 1999 . In other trade , the U . S . unit gained to 1 . 4430 / 40 Swiss francs from 1 . 4415 / 20 but fell to Canadian $ 1 . 3810 / 15 from C $ 1 . 3825 / 30 . The British pound rose to $ 1 . 6352 / 62 from $ 1 . 6348 / 58 . The Australian dollar fell to $ 0 . 7505 / 12 from $ 0 . 7517 / 22 . ( ( - - Roanne Daniels , 212 - 859 - 1677 ) )

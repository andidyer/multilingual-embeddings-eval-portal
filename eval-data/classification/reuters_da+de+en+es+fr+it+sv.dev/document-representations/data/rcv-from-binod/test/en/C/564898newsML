Deutz sees better 1997 operating result . German machinery maker Deutz AG said on Tuesday it expected its operating result to improve further in 1997 , as sales also rose from last year ' s levels . Deutz did not specify its 1996 operating result in materials provided before its annual news conference , but it showed a loss of 19 million marks ( $ 11 million ) from ordinary activities in 1996 , narrowing sharply from a 1 . 187 billion mark ordinary loss the year before . It said " other operating profits " were 403 million marks in 1996 , up from 277 million marks the year before , while " other operating expenditures " were 686 million marks , down from 1 . 221 billion marks . The company , formerly known as Kloeckner - Humboldt - Deutz AG , has undergone a radical restructuring since its one - billion - mark rescue last year by its creditor banks led by Deutsche Bank AG . " The strategic realignment forms the basis for a further improvement in operating results from last year , " the company said in a statement . " We are convinced that by concentrating exclusively on motor manufacturing we are on the right course . " For 1996 , the company reported a net profit of 874 million marks , swinging from a net loss of 1 . 134 billion marks the year before . The profit resulted largely from 897 million marks in extraordinaries , mainly the banks ' contributions to the bailout . Sales were 2 . 921 billion marks , down from 3 . 285 billion marks , while debt was reduced to 602 million marks from 1 . 023 billion marks . - - Terence Gallagher , Bonn Newsroom , 49 - 228 - 26097150 ( $ = 1 . 727 German Marks )

BOXING - MCCALL INSISTS BIZARRE BEHAVIOR WAS STRATEGY . Oliver McCall , who appeared to suffer a nervous breakdown in the middle of his heavyweight title fight with Briton Lennox Lewis Friday , insisted on Saturday that his bizarre behaviour in the ring was part of his strategy . Referee Mills Lane stopped the bout 55 seconds into the fifth round after McCall seemed unwilling to continue fighting . " My strategy was , and I know this sounds kind of absurd , a type of rope - a - dope , " said McCall , referring to the strategy Muhammad Ali used more than 20 years ago to tire and upset George Foreman in Zaire . The 31 - year - old McCall , an admitted drug addict who was in a rehabilitiation programme while training for the fight , had refused to go to his corner following the third round , instead pacing in the ring . And he began openly sobbing after the fourth , a round in which he had thrown only two punches . But in a rambling news conference , during which McCall spoke virtually non - stop for some 45 minutes , the one - time champion complained the bout should not have been stopped . " A fight is supposed to be stopped when a man is unable to defend himself , I was able to defend myself , " he said . " Guess what , I ' m alright , I ' m not beat up . " The referee came to the conclusion I didn ' t want to fight , " said McCall , who had stopped Lewis in the second round in 1994 to win the World Boxing Council heavyweight crown . " The ref didn ' t give me the opportunity to play out my fight plan . He stopped it prematurely , " McCall complained . " Lennox was tiring and frustrated . He hit me on the jaw and Oliver was still there . I knew that after a few more rounds Lennox would say ( to himself ) that he can ' t do anything with Oliver . He didn ' t faze me . He couldn ' t hurt me . " McCall said he resorted to the passive strategy after the first two rounds because he became aware that he did not have what he considered a proper emotional outlook for the fight . McCall claimed what appeared to everyone to be terrible emotional anguish was his way of getting himself psyched up . " I ' m very emotional , " McCall said . " I usually cry when I come into the ring . I wasn ' t emotional at the start of this fight . " I tried to pump myself up and get mentally ready , but that emotion wasn ' t there . I didn ' t have my game face , so I had to come up with a different strategy , " he explained with apparent sincerity , even if he was deluding himself to whatever may have been the actual causes of his behaviour . " When I cried in the corner , I was getting emotional , " added McCall , who said he thought of his late baby daughter , who died days after birth , as a way of conjuring up the missing emotion . " I wanted the fight to continue . If the fight would have continued my anger would have brewed up , " he insisted . " If the fight kept going , my anger would have brewed up and I would have knocked out Lewis . " That seems an unlikely scenario , considering that during the fifth round McCall kept walking away from Lewis , sometimes with his back to the Briton . Still , McCall was sticking to his story . " They gave Ali the opportunity to do his strategy . Ali is a legend and Oliver McCall is nothing , " he said . " I never stopped . I never gave up . That ain ' t me . " The Nevada State Athletic Commission was holding up McCall ' s estimated $ 3 million purse for his failure to compete in the ring . The commission will decide whether McCall will be fined and how much , if any , of the purse he will receive . Despite his sad display in the ring , McCall tried to fend off the idea that his boxing career was over , saying he would like a third meeting with Lewis after one or two warm - up bouts to prove Friday ' s lack of performance was a fluke . " It was a disappointing fight , " he said , " but it would have had a dramatic ending . "

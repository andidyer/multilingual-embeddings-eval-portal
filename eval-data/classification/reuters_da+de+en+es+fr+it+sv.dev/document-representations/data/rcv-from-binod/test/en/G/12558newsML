Morocco forbids Michael Jackson show in Casablanca . American pop star Michael Jackson ' s September 27 concert has been cancelled after authorities refused to give permission for it , the private Moroccan television channel 2M said on Saturday . " Moroccan authorities did not give the green light for Michael Jackson ' s show but gave no explanation either , " the Casablanca - based station said in its evening news bulletin . Jackson visited the city , Morocco ' s financial centre , on his return from South Africa last month and said he wanted to perform there because it reminded him of the Hollywood movie Casablanca . " Fears of gathering more than 100 , 000 young people could be one of the motives explaining the authorities ' decison , " a concert organiser who had earlier conferred with Moroccan officials told the television , hinting at possible street protests against the glitzy Western - style show . A live televised broadcast of Jackson ' s show to the United States had also been planned by the Moroccan organisers , the television added . The interior ministry has in the past banned other big concerts , including one by the popular Casablanca - based satirist Ahmed Sanoussi , without explanation . Casablanca , with four million inhabitants , has frequently seen demonstrations by students , workers and young Moslem fundamentalists . Officials were not immediately available for comment .

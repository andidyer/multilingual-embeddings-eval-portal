Ferraro favored over D ' Amato in ' 98 - poll . Former Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro would handily defeat New York ' s incumbent Sen . Alfonse D ' Amato in next year ' s election , according to a poll released Wednesday . Ferraro , the first woman to run for vice president on a major party ticket , holds a 55 to 34 percent lead over D ' Amato among respondents to the poll by Quinnipiac College in Hamden , Conn . She would fare the best among the potential Democratic challengers to D ' Amato , who also include New York City Public Advocate Mark Green and Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn . Asked about the Republican incumbent , 40 percent of respondents said they approved of D ' Amato ' s performance , while 50 percent said they did not . But 72 percent said they think the sometimes caustic and outspoken D ' Amato " can get things done . " D ' Amato was active in pursuing the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons and a heavy supporter of former Sen . Bob Dole ' s unsuccessful presidential campaign . His more recent involvement promoting breast cancer research and efforts to help locate money in Swiss banks that belonged to Holocaust victims have helped him recover from even more negative approval ratings last summer , said Maurice Carroll , director of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute . " New Yorkers respect Senator D ' Amato for getting things done , but they don ' t admire him , " Carroll said . Ferraro lost the 1992 Democratic Senate primary in New York to challenge D ' Amato and lately has been considering a return to politics . The former congresswoman and trial attorney is a moderator on CNN ' s political show " Crossfire . " In 1984 , she was the running mate to Democratic presidential contender Walter Mondale , who lost by a landslide to Republican Ronald Reagan . The poll was conducted from Feb . 24 to March 2 of 1 , 071 New Yorkers who said they were registered voters . The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent .

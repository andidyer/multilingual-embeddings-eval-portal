French Communist leaders recommend joining govt . Leaders of France ' s Communist Party , which holds the balance of power following a parliamentary election , recommended on Tuesday that it join the new Socialist - led government . The national committee , whose views are traditionally followed by grassroots members , said it had decided to recommend joining the left ' s parliamentary majority and bringing Communists into the government . The brief written statement made no reference to conditions the party might make for joining the government . Local party members were due to discuss the issue later on Tuesday , pending a final decision on Wednesday . The party has said it opposes a single European currency and wants wage rises for the low - paid . Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , who took office on Tuesday , has said the Socialist party line on Europe would prevail in any government which also included ministers from other parties .

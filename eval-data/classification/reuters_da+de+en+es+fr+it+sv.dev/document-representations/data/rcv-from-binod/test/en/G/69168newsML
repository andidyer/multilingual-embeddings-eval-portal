RTRS - The Weekend in Australian Sport . RUGBY LEAGUESYDNEY - Sunday ' s semifinal between Manly and Cronulla was barely over before Manly coach Bob Fulton started downplaying suggestions his side would start next week ' s grand final against St George as raging hot favourites . Fulton had just watched his side comnplete a clinical 24 - 0 demolition of Cronulla but rejected the tag of favourites which had seen Manly installed at 1 - 3 to beat St George . " In everyone else ' s minds we probably are ( favourites ) but in our own minds we ' re not , " Fulton told reporters . " We went out there today thinking we were an even money chance and we won by a big score , but I don ' t think ( St George coach ) David Waite and his players will be quaking in their boots . We know we ' re in for a very tough game . They ' re a very , very well coached side , " he said . St George continued their giant - killing run with a 29 - 12 demolition of North Sydney on Saturday , a victory which took the Dragons ' extraordinary season - ending run to 12 wins from their last 13 matches . Manly finished their semifinal with several injury concerns , including New Zealand fullback Matthew Ridge . Halfback Geoff Toovey and centre Terry Hill also came off injured but all three said they would be fit for next Sunday ' s grand final . Toovey suffered an ugly gash under his right eye late in the match , while international centre Hill aggravated an ankle injury that had made him a doubtful starter against Cronulla . " I ' ve got no problem with my vision so I ' ll be all right , " said Toovey , who declined requests for television interviews or newspaper photographs . Ridge was badly concussed after a tackle on Cronulla centre Paul Donaghy and was taken from the field midway through the first half on a motorised stretcher . Despite the injury Fulton said Ridge would play next week . " He ' s all right now . He ' s probably got a bit of a headache but when I saw him at halftime his eyes were glazed over and he wasn ' t in any position to go back on , " Fulton said . Cronulla fullback Craig Peachey was less than impressed with a number of Manly players who went out of their way to show their appreciation for two errors which led to Manly tries . Peachey dropped the ball after being tackled by Toovey early in the second half , gifting Manly secondrower Steve Menzies an easy try . Fifteen minutes later Peachey misjudged the bounce of a Cliff Lyons kick , allowing winger Danny Moore to score . Hill and winger John Hopoate rubbed salt in the wounds by congratulating Peachey after his mistakes . " If I didn ' t make the mistakes they wouldn ' t have scored but it looked pretty spiteful , " Peachey said . " After the game I shook their hands and wished them luck because that ' s the kind of bloke I am , but hopefully St George will get up . " Cronulla coach John Lang shrugged off the incidents , rating Manly the best team in the world . - - - - RUGBY LEAGUESYDNEY - St George were champing at the bit to take on Manly after extending North Sydney ' s run without a premiership to 74 years . Written off at the start of the year after losing two coaches and many key players to other clubs and only narrowing avoiding a merger , St George have performed miracles after being quoted at 100 - 1 by bookmakers at the start of the year . " It ' s a great result from where we ' ve come from , " captain Mark Coyne told reporters . " We only had 15 or 16 players at David ' s first training session . We ' ve really dug ourselves out of the gutter and each week we ' ve got more confident . " Despite his side ' s remarkable run Waite said St George had still to produce their best . " The great thing is that we haven ' t played our best game yet this season and we know we can still play better than we did ( on Saturday ) , " he said . North Sydney coach Peter Louis described his side ' s performance as their worst of the year . - - - - AFLSYDNEY - Sydney full - forward Tony Lockett was nursing the most famous groin in Australian sport on Sunday , 24 hours after kicking Sydney into their first AFL grand final with a match - winning point in Saturday ' s semifinal against Essendon . Lockett gave Sydney a 10 . 10 ( 70 ) to 10 . 9 ( 69 ) win over Essendon with a 55 - metre punt for a behind right on full - time of Saturday ' s semifinal , his longest kick in two weeks . The AFL ' s leading goalkicker sat out a light training run on Sunday but coach Rodney Eade said his star player would play against North Melbourne even if his nagging groin injury means he can ' t train until Wednesday . North Melbourne qualified for the grand final earlier on Saturday with a 38 - point demolition of Brisbane . " They were very impressive , " Eade said of North Melbourne ' s win . " Even though we finished on top ( of the AFL table ) , North have probably been the form side all over the season and I think their form ' s lifted this time as well . " Eade was also not about to let the Swans get carried away by reaching the grand final and told his players to keep their minds on the job . " All we ' ve done is earned the right to play in the grand final , " Eade said . " We ' ve got to keep our feet on the ground , stay focussed and get all our injuries right and get everyone right for next week . " - - - - TENNISSPLIT - Australia completed a 4 - 1 win over Croatia in their Davis Cup tie over the weekend to regain the right to play in the tournament ' s elite world group . John Newcombe ' s players secured the tie after adding the doubles rubber on Saturday to their two singles wins the previous day . Mark Philippoussis then stretched the margin to 4 - 0 with a 6 - 1 6 - 4 win over Goran Oresic in the first of the dead reverse singles on Sunday . Sasa Hirszon saved Croatia from a whitewash when he beat Jason Stoltenberg 6 - 2 6 - 2 in the final match . Stoltenberg had set up Australia ' s win when he outlasted top Croatian player and world number four Goran Ivanisevic 3 - 6 6 - 3 3 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 2 on Friday after Philippoussis had beaten Hirszon 6 - 2 6 - 3 6 - 2 . Mark Woodforde then teamed with Pat Rafter to beat Ivanisevic and Hirszon 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 4 in the doubles to secure the tie . - - - - BASEBALLLAUSANNE - The International Baseball Association ( IBA ) cleared the path for professionals to compete in the 2000 Sydney Olympics after voting to change its amateur - only rule on Saturday . The association ' s decision to embrace professionalism was overwhelming with 56 of 65 countries , far more than the two - thirds majority necessary , voting in favour . While the United States would automatically become gold medal favourites , an American Dream Team is not expected to dominate the same way their basketball counterparts have done . Cuba , gold medallists at the Atlanta Olympics , have dominated the amateur game and would remain a threat while the sport ranks high in popularity in Japan . Saturday ' s decision was seen as necessary if baseball was to maintain its status as an Olympic sport . IBA president Aldo Notari said it had been made clear that the IOC , who meet next month to finalise the 2000 Games programme , wanted to see the best players on the field . " With the limitations to the number of athletes and sports , only sports that attract media attention will be kept on the programme , " said Notari . - - - - SOCCERPRETORIA - South Africa won the Four Nations friendly tournament in Pretoria on Saturday by drawing 0 - 0 with Ghana in an ill - tempered match after Australia ended a successful tournament by beating Kenya 4 - 0 . Australia thoroughly outplayed a limp Kenyan team , scoring twice within six minutes in the first half to effectively kill off the opposition . First Jason Polak with a 32nd minute header and then a shot from Warren Spink gave them a 2 - 0 half - time lead which substitute Damian Mori added to in the 63rd minute . Kenya ' s misery was completed when Alex Tobin converted a 78th minute penalty shortly after Tom Juma and coach Vojo Gardesevic had been sent off . Kenya ended the tournament with three defeats while Australia finished second just one point behind South Africa . Ghana were third with four ponts from their three matches . Kenyan referee Suleiman Gharib sent off three players and handed out six cautions as South Africa struggled to secure the point they needed to edge Australia into second place . - - - - SQUASHCAIRO - World champion Jansher Khan avenged his defeat by Australian Rodney Eyles in the Hong Kong Open final earlier this month by beating him in the final of the Gezira Open on Friday . Jansher claimed his 74th major tournament victory in 65 minutes , winning 15 - 13 15 - 14 15 - 6 . World number two Eyles kept pace with Jansher in the steamy conditions in the opening two games , leading 13 - 12 in the first and reaching 14 - 14 in the second . But the Pakistani upped the pressure in the third with a run from 5 - 3 to 14 - 3 and match ball in a single hand . He ended the second game tiebreak with as sweet a wrongfooting , backhand crosscourt drop as he has played and finished the match by forcing the tiring Australian into a desperate attempt at a forehand kill that clipped the tin in the top left corner . " It was like playing in Pakistan , " said Jansher . " Good , hot weather and good crowds . I play well here and will come back every time they want me . " Said Eyles : " I needed the break in one of those early games but he lifted his game at the vital moments . " We play the World Open in Karachi in November and that is the place to beat him . I don ' t want him turning up there mean from losing twice or three times on the way . " - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

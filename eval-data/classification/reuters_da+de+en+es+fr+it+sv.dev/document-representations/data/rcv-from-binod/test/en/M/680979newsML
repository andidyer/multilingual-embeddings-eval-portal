FOCUS - Dlr up on G7 peace , Euro stocks well down . The dollar held its advance against the yen on Monday as a weekend summit of industrialised nations played down U . S . - Japan trade tension but gloomy European bourses were not helped by a poor start on Wall Street . The U . S . currency held gains of over the yen in early afternoon with the market breathing a sigh of relief that fears of a Tokyo - Washington row over Japan ' s big trade surplus proved unfounded at the summit of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) nations in Denver . But European equity markets had a cheerless day , with no joy coming from Wall Street ' s negative opening . London dropped over one percent on fears of higher interest rates and pre - budget nerves , while Frankfurt closed with steep losses after investors took profits from last week ' s record - breaking run . London , Europe ' s biggest bourse , clawed back some losses after tumbling by 46 . 9 points to 4 , 547 . 0 on the blue - chip FTSE index as worries over sterling ' s strength added to the market ' s woes and depressed the futures market . " The futures have been hammered again today and that ' s pulled the FTSE lower , " one dealer said . " It seems the market just can ' t get over its worries about rates and the budget and we just keep on going down . " London has fallen continuously since hitting a new closing high of 4 , 783 . 1 10 days ago . Dealers blame the growing expectations of interest rate rises and concern about the possible abolition of tax breaks on dividends for pension funds in the July 2 budget . " We are now five percent off the high , " said the head of trading at one brokerage . " Obviously we are going to be rocked ahead of the budget but we have come off a long way . " More dark clouds gathered as investors counted the cost of the pound ' s 59 - month high against the German mark . It ' s strength is hurting currency - sensitive stocks , such as British Steel Plc , which was down 9 - 3 / 4p to 148 - 1 / 2 in afternoon trade . In Frankfurt , floor trade ended down 0 . 9 percent on profit - taking after the 30 - share DAX index hit an all - time trading high on Friday of 3 , 798 . 94 points . After - hours trading on the computerised IBIS index fared worse and registsred losses of 1 . 1 percent in early afternoon trade . " It looks like we are set for a period of light consolidation , " said one Frankfurt - based trader . " This appears to be profit - taking but it is nothing severe . This is an issue for today in the market , not the start of a correction . " In Paris , stocks slipped in and out of profit in quiet trade on the last day of the monthly settlement . " There ' s no news , nothing going on , " a broker said . On the foreign exchange market , the dollar held most of its gains after vaulting 115 yen in early European trade on the strength of the soothing noises from the G7 summit . " We are holding above the 115 - yen level . The fact the G7 didn ' t say much on the trade surplus is positive , " said Lee Ferridge , currency strategist at Commerzbank . Many dealers had expected Washington to use the G7 meeting in Denver as a forum to criticise Tokyo over Japan ' s growing trade surplus , but the summit barely mentioned currencies , and differences were played down . " The U . S . is still looking at the bigger picture . . . ( there ) is no point driving dollar / yen down to curb Japan ' s trade surplus in the short - term . This would just drive Japan back into recession and the U . S . would never sell anything over there , " said Ferridge . G7 nations in a joint statement at the end of the meeting said Japan needed to spur strong domestic demand - led growth , avoid any significant increase in its external surplus , deregulate and enact structural fiscal reforms . " This has come as a relief to the market and consequently the dollar has benefited , " said Nick Stamenkovic , economist at DKB International .

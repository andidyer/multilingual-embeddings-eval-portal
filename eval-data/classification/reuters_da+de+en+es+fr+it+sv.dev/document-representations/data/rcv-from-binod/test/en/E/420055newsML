Greenspan Q & A - Part VI , Fed doesn ' t thwart growth . Following are excerpts from the question and answer session of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the House Banking Monetary Policy subcommittee on Wednesday . Greenspan delivered the second and final leg of his Humphrey - Hawkins address at 1400 EST / 1900 GMT . Rep . JACKSON : " . . . Does the Federal Reserve have a role to play in making sure that an expanding economy remains expansive so that it reaches those that have been unemployed or underemployed ? " GREENSPAN : " As I said before , our goal is maximum sustainable economic growth . That ' s about as strong a commitment as I think one could make towards maintaining the issue of job creation and sustainable income levels . " With respect to the structural problems which are clearly there , and you point out , there ' s very little that monetary policy can do . That is an issue for other forms of policy . That ' s the reason why I raised the question about where ' s the locus of the policy as such because it ' s got to be broader than just mainly monitary policy . " JACKSON : " I know the President has most recently . . . congratualated several companies for expanding their hiring programs to reach out to welfare recipients . " If in fact there is a rate hike , it slows the economy down and it slows down job creation at a time when we ' re operating here on Capitol Hill under the assumption that an expanding economy is going to employ people , that we ' re going to move off of public assistance . " Any effort to slow the economy down runs contrary to many of the assumptions we ' ve been functioning with on Capitol Hill . " GREENSPAN : " When we raise rates it usually is for the purpose of stabilizing the elements which threaten the growth of the economy . All I can say to you is that we don ' t believe the purpose of the Federal Reserve is to restrain growth . " ( ( - - N . A . Treasury Desk , 212 - 859 - 1660 ) )

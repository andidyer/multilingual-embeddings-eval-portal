Calif . researchers link gene to Down ' s syndrome . California researchers said on Tuesday they had identified a major genetic factor contributing to mental retardation in people with Down ' s syndrome . Working with mice bred to carry segments of human chromosome 21 in their DNA , scientists at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley linked learning deficits to the gene DYRK . Any deviation from the normal complement of two copies of this gene appears to impair the ability to learn , the researchers said . The findings of the researchers , led by Edward Rubin and Desmond Smith , geneticists with the Berkeley lab ' s life sciences division , were published in the May 1 edition of the scientific journal Nature Genetics . " Our work suggests that you need exactly two copies of DYRK for normal development , " Rubin , who heads biology research for the lab ' s Human Genome Center , said in a statement . Down ' s syndrome occurs in about one of every 800 newborns , with the incidence increasing markedly in the children born to women over 35 , the Berkeley lab said . It is the leading genetic cause of mental retardation and is associated with a shorter - than - average life expectancy of 55 years , it said . Most people with Down ' s syndrome carry a complete extra copy of chromosome 21 in all of their cells . But there are rare forms of Down ' s syndrome in which only part of chromosome 21 is present in triplicate . Smith and Rubin bred a series of mice containing different adjacent segments of human chromosome 21 . To identify which gene was responsible for mental retardation , they assessed the learning and memory skills of their genetically altered mice using a standardized test . The strain of mouse that performed most poorly on the test carried a human DYRK gene in addition to a pair of mouse DYRK genes , the researchers found . They also said that DYRK is almost identical to a fruit fly gene that also plays a role in learning . " Obviously a large leap of faith must be taken to equate learning in flies to that in humans , " Rubin said . " However , the corresponding findings in both flies and mice . . . support the idea that altered expression of this gene ( DYRK ) may be an important contributor to the learning defects in humans with Down syndrome , " he said . The Berkeley lab is a U . S . Department of Energy national laboratory managed by the University of California .

S . African protesters test new constitution . Demonstrators on Friday tested their right to protest under South Africa ' s new constitution by staging one march after another during the opening of parliament by President Nelson Mandela . Police turned out in force to control the marches but apart from some scuffles , the protesters - - demanding fairer fishing quotas , legalisation of marijuana and more research on AIDS - - were able to exercise their new democratic rights . The peaceful demonstrations were in stark contrast to bloody protests in Johannesburg on Thursday , in which at least three people were killed in clashes with police when anger over allegedly unfair community charges boiled over . In Cape Town , a heavy police presence and some prior negotiation with would - be protesters kept a tight lid on the demonstrations . First to take to the streets on one of the most important days in the city ' s calendar were a group of " ganja " - smoking Rastafarians , calling on parliament to legalise marijuana . Police arrested 41 of them for participating in an illegal gathering - - although marches are allowed , organisers must get permission . Two were also arrested for smoking marijuana , which is a banned substance , in public . Their spokesman , Richard Kraak , said Mandela had been invited to share a smoke with the group but declined . " I guess he is not into us , " Kraak told reporters . Mandela , speaking to a packed parliament in an address televised live to the nation , was unaware of the circus atmosphere around the stately parliament buildings . Hot on the heels of the Rastafarian protest came a march by fishermen angered by what they called an " unfair allocation of fishing quotas against disadvantaged communities " . As soon as they left the scene , medical students marched to protest against government plans to force them to do a two - year internship in rural areas after completing their studies . Police grabbed an AIDS activist smeared with fake blood when he broke through a security cordon to demand the resignation of controversial Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma . The radical Moslem group Qibla , chanting " Death to America " and burning Israeli flags , kept police busy even after the ceremonies were over in parliament , marching on the Israeli embassy , which was sealed off by razor wire . Police spokesman Wicus Holtzhausen told Reuters he could not remember a day when his men had to contend with so many marches . However , a relieved Holtzhausen added : " They were all peaceful because we had talked to them about keeping their marches within the law . "

SOCCER - ARSENAL PROVIDE WINNING WELCOME FOR WENGER . English soccer ' s cosmopolitan cocktail of imports from distant Tula , Tibilisi , Sao Paulo and Surinam has a fresh ingredient since Arsene Wenger ' s arrival . Frenchman Wenger , the new Arsenal manager , savoured a victorious start to his job when the London club won 2 - 0 at Blackburn on Saturday . Goals by Ian Wright in the third and 51st minutes lifted Arsenal to second in the premier league , just one point behind Newcastle , and Wenger later reflected on an influential performance by the former England striker . " Ian showed that he is calm and cool at the right moments , but that ' s why he ' s a great striker and that ' s why he ' s Ian Wright , " said Wenger . " But his team play was also good and he worked hard for the team as well as scoring two great goals . " Wenger must bring stability to to a club that has suffered two troubled years . Midfielder Paul Merson ' s admission of drink , gambling and drugs addictions in November 1994 , the departure of George Graham as manager in February 1995 for receiving illegal payments and the recent announcement by captain Tony Adams that he was an acoholic have undermined a club of great tradition and significant achievement . Such is the challenge facing Wenger , only the fourth man from outside the British Isles to coach a senior English club following Slovak Jozef Venglos at Aston Villa , Argentine Ossie Ardiles at Tottenham and Dutchman Ruud Gullit , currently at Chelsea . Wenger took the job because he believes the premier league is one of the most important in the world now and " it was a challenge for me to be maybe the first foreign manager - - and for sure the first Frenchman - - to go there and try to be successful " . Although bottom - of - the - table Blackburn did not offer the most daunting opposition for Wenger ' s first game in charge he said it was " important to the supporters and everybody surrounding the club that we won " . The Frenchman added : " Blackburn enjoyed good pressure on the ball , but we were organised and showed that we have good solidarity . " At the start of the season , Arsenal were often 2 - 0 down after 20 minutes and that forced the team to attack . " Today I felt that after the early goal we didn ' t perhaps take as many chances as we should have and seemed content to just wait to see if the second goal would come rather than going for it . "

Akzo Nobel sees some growth in 1997 . Chemical group Akzo Nobel NV said on Wednesday that economic prospects in 1997 were in its favour . " Economic prospects in 1997 are in our favour : continued - albeit moderate - growth and low inflation . In our most important markets , on average , somewhat higher growth rates are expected than in 1996 , " chairman Cees van Lede said in a speech . " Although it is obviously too early to specify our results over 1996 , this much is clear that , as stated earlier , our net income before extraordinaries will be in the same order of magnitude as in 1995 , " he said . The firm said that relative to 1995 , 1996 was weak on volume and strong in currencies . " In chemicals , the expected increase in volumes were late in coming and in many cases are still not there , " Akzo Nobel said . " Coatings is heading for a better result than in 1995 and closed the merger book in 1996 , " it said . " Pharma will come out of 1996 with higher sales than the preceding year in spite of the scientific dispute surrounding the pill , " Van Lede said . Van Lede added that the antidepressant Remeron and fertility hormone Puregon had received excellent market acceptance . - - Amsterdam newsroom + 31 20 504 5000

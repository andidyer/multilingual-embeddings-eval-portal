U . S . averages one chemical accident an hour - study . Accidents involving the release of toxic chemicals were reported at a rate of nearly one an hour in the United States over the last eight years , and many more likely went unreported , environmental advocates said on Wednesday . " The daily barrage of chemical accidents in the United States adds to the toxic pollution that scientists believe may be linked to increasing rates of cancer , birth defects , reproductive dysfunction , immune suppression and other health problems in humans and wildlife , " the report by the U . S . Public Interest Rearch Group ( PIRG ) and the National Environmental Law Centre said . " Nearly five percent of the accidents that occurred in the United States basin resulted in immediate injuries , evacuations or deaths , " said the report , released on the 12th anniversary of the Bhopal , India , chemical accident which killed more than 3 , 500 people . The report said information from the Emergency Response Notification System showed more than 23 , 000 accidents involving toxic chemicals - - an average of 20 per day - - were reported in 1993 - 95 . But PIRG said the rate likely was much higher , as many industrial and transportation companies do not notify authorities , as is required . " Our membership has a good compliance record ( with federal regulations ) and will continue to report any accident that ' s required under the guidelines , " said Matthew Weinstock , spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association . " Our members take their commitment to protecting health and the environment and trying to prevent accidents very seriously . We are doing everything we can to improve performance , " Weinstock said . More than half of the reported accidents were in Texas , California , Louisiana , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Illinois , Georgia and Alaska , the report said . More than 40 percent of the accidents were in just 48 counties . Harris County , Texas , alone accounted for 1 , 588 in 1993 - 95 , it said . " While many of the accidents were small scale , even releases of small amounts of some potent chemicals can have long - term , harmful impact on the environment and public health , " PIRG said in a statement . It also said the Emergency Response Notification System does not monitor a comprehensive list of chemicals , leaving many accidents involving potentially dangerous chemicals unreported . The report advocated increasing the number of chemicals that are listed in a public right - to - know programme on toxic chemicals used in communities , more planning for accident prevention and increasing the federal Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board ' s resources for investigating the causes of accidents and ways to prevent them .

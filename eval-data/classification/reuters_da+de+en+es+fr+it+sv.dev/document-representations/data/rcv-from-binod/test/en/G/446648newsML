Reformers gain force in Russia new cabinet . The new cast of deputy premiers , announced on Monday by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , suggested reformers have reinforced their position in the Russian government . One conservative and one reformer among the four existing first deputies and nine deputy prime ministers kept their jobs : - Reformist First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais , appointed just 10 days ago , acquired the post of Finance Minister - Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Kulikov , who kept his post of Interior Minister . Defining the relative political positions of Russian officials is problematic . But four generally conservative deputy premiers and three relatively reformist deputy premiers lost these positions . Some could stay in junior posts : These were the conservatives : - First Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Bolshakov - Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Babichev - Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha - Deputy Prime Minister Oleg LobovAnd the reformists : - First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Ilyushin - First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin - Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Alexander LivshitsOf four deputy prime ministers whose positions are harder to define , three - - Oleg Davydov , Vitaly Ignatenko and Vladimir Fortov - - lost their jobs and one - - Valery Serov - - kept it . Davydov remained as Foreign Economic Relations Minister . The new cast of deputy prime ministers is clearly dominated by reformists after five of them joined the cabinet : - First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov , in charge of welfare , fighting monopolies and dealing with regional issues - Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak , promoted from communications minister to take charge of technology and science - Deputy Prime Minister Yakov Urinson , promoted from deputy economy minister , who also becomes Economy Minister - Deputy Prime Minister Alfred Kokh , who also remains head of the State Property Committee - - effectively privatisation minister - Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev , up to now reformist mayor of the industrial centre of Samara . No conservatives have yet been newly appointed . Altogether the new cast of deputy prime ministers has five reformers , one conservative and two technocrats whose positions are less clear . Chernomyrdin said on Monday that some ministerial positions are still vacant and will be filled within the next week .

Two weeks before Oscars - nominees act humble . Hollywood put on its humble face Tuesday as Oscar nominees expressed humility at being honoured for the movie industry ' s biggest awards . At a luncheon for nominees before the March 24 Academy Awards ceremony , several stars expressed how being nominated was honour enough and winning an Oscar was not important . But a few , like Kristin Scott Thomas , who is up for best actress for " The English Patient " , were refreshingly honest . " I ' d love to win , " she told reporters at the Beverly Hilton . " I feel like a child of six and I ' m over the moon . " And Barbara Hershey , nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for " Portrait of a Lady , " was equally frank . " Honestly , I ' d love to win , " she said . " I am shocked at how much being nominated means . " Scott Thomas summed up the uncharacteristic humility in Tinseltown at this time of the year . The English actress said she had been at a photo shoot the day before with her son . When she asked him what he thought of it , his reply was close to describing the feeling in Oscar - crazed Hollywood . " ' Mommy , everyone has to say they love you and that you look beautiful , ' " Scott Thomas said with a wry grin . Also at the luncheon was one of her rivals for best actress - - Frances McDormand - - who was nominated for her role as a small - town police officer in " Fargo " . " This is all pretty overwhelming , " she said . " I lead a pretty simple life in New York . " After the Oscar ballyhoo has died down , McDormand said she was anxious to return to the stage . " I haven ' t done a play for three and a half years and I can ' t be away so long . " It ' s a different set of muscles ( from acting in films ) and mine are atrophying , " she said . Billy Bob Thornton , who has been nominated for best actor and best adapted screenplay for " Sling Blade " , brought a touch of good ol ' boy earthiness to the glittering event . " I feel like the ugly guy who got a date for the prom , " he said in his southern drawl . Asked by reporters if he would be wearing the same black T - shirt , jeans and John Deere baseball cap to the Academy Awards show , he laughed : " They won ' t let me . I asked but they said ' Show a little class . ' " Three nominees for best supporting actor were on hand - - James Woods for " Ghosts of Mississippi " , Armin Mueller - Stahl for " Shine " and Cuba Gooding Jr . , for " Jerry Maguire " . " All corny stuff aside , all the people in my category are friends or people I admire , so being nominated is good , " said Woods , who plays a racist killer in the film . He said he felt he had more chance this time compared to 10 years ago " When I was nominated ( for best actor in " Salvador " ) against Paul Newman on his eighth try . " It was like going to the guillotine then , and all we could do was practice our smiles . " German actor Mueller - Stahl said tongue - in - cheek : " I am proud and every day I get a little bit more famous . " Gooding , who played a football player represented by sports agent Tom Cruise , was asked how it felt to have one of his lines " Show me the money ! " turn into a catch - phrase . " It ' s sort of cool . When people get it , it validates you for your next character and I sure have validation now ! " His life had changed so drastically , he said , " now people ask how I pronounce my first name ! "

NHL ICE HOCKEY - RUFF NAMED NEW SABRES COACH . Lindy Ruff , who played 10 seasons in Buffalo , will return as coach of the Sabres after signing a multi - year contract with the National Hockey League club on Monday . Ruff , 37 , spent the past four seasons with the Florida Panthers as an assistant under Doug MacLean . Florida reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1996 , losing to the Colorado Avalanche . Ruff , who becomes the 15th head coach in franchise history , has a tough act to follow . He replaces Ted Nolan , who won the Jack Adams Award as NHL Coach of the Year . Nolan won a power struggle with fired general manager John Muckler , only to be left out in the cold by new GM Darcy Regier , who did not make a concerted effort to keep Nolan after making just one offer of a one - year contract . Nolan , in the final year of his contract last season , led the overachieving Sabres to the Northeast Division and a semifinal berth in the Eastern Conference playoffs . " I loved playing in Buffalo , " said Ruff , who also spent two seasons with the New York Rangers . " The fans were always appreciative , and I felt that I mirrored the city ' s values of hard work and persistence . As a head coach , I will continue to hold myself to these principles , and will expect the same effort from my players . " One of the first things Ruff will have to do is unite the clubhouse . Nolan was not able to do that and had a strained relationship with goaltender Dominik Hasek , the Hart and Vezina Trophy winner . Hasek , who missed most of the playoffs with a knee injury , blasted Nolan before Regier made the contract offer to him . Ruff worked primarily with the penalty - killing teams and defencemen as an assistant in Florida and is credited with helping to develop defencemen Ed Jovanovski and Rhett Warrener into solid blue - line forces . " Lindy is the type of person who exemplifies hard work , toughness , and the tenacity to succeed , " said Regier .

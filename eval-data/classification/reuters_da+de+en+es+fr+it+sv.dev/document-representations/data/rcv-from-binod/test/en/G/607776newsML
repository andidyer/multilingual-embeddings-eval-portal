Swedish PM slams U . S . envoy over nuclear criticism . Sweden ' s Prime Minister Goran Persson accused the U . S . ambassador to Sweden on Thursday of interfering in Sweden ' s domestic affairs by criticising a decision to begin phasing out nuclear power . " I ' ve never witnessed such a thing before . It ' s exceptional , " an annoyed Persson told reporters . " There are normal channels to pass on another country ' s views on relations between countries . That ' s an ambassador ' s normal duty . But I have never experienced the likes of stepping into a tense domestic policy situation like this , " he said . U . S . ambassador Thomas Siebert criticised the planned but controversial phasing out of the Barseback nuclear power plant on Swedish television news on Wednesday . " The closure of the nuclear power plant sends very negative signals to companies that could be interested in investing in Sweden , " Siebert told the news programme Rapport . U . S . companies expect the phasing out of Barseback to lead to higher energy costs , Siebert said . Persson said he did not plan to demand an apology but found the comments unnecessary . The U . S . embassy in Stockholm issued a statement denying that Siebert had intended to criticise the Swedish government . " The ambassador was careful to point out that such a decision is a matter for Sweden to decide , not the United States , " it said . He added , however , that he was reflecting the views of American business that future U . S . investment in Sweden could be damaged if energy prices rose as a result of the nuclear plant closure . The closure of Barseback will be the first in a programme to close Sweden ' s 12 nuclear reactors . Nuclear power supplies more than half the country ' s power needs and Swedish businesses have complained that no replacement power source will be available to replace nuclear energy . The close - down will be phased over a lengthy period , with only two reactors closing in the next five years .

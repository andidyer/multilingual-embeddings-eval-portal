Moslem rebels slaughter 38 people in Algeria - paper . Suspected Moslem militants killed 38 villagers in two separate attacks on hamlets southwest of the Algerian capital this week , an Algerian newspaper said on Saturday . Le Matin said the 38 villagers were killed overnight Wednesday - Thursday by having their throats cut or decapitated and their bodies burnt . Two other newspapers , reporting the same attacks , put the number of dead at 36 . " At 2 a . m . we heard people shouting and minutes later we were attacked by gunmen . . . wearing uniforms of paratroopers , " said a survivor quoted by Le Matin . El Watan newspaper said about 50 rebels , on board a truck , stormed Si Zoubir hamlet in Hajout area , some 65 km ( 40 miles ) southwest of Algiers , killing 24 villagers by slashing their throats . They then moved to neighbouring Douch village and slaughtered 12 more people , it said . " The victims were killed by having their throats slashed by knives or hachets while others were burnt alive , " el Watan said . " As soon as the massacres ended , the terrorists wrecked everything in the houses and fled , " it added . Le Matin said among the 38 massacred villagers were an elderly man and his five - year - old grandson . El Watan said about 20 children were among the victims . The latest massacre took place some 72 hours after Moslem rebels killed 47 people , mostly by cutting their throats , in two attacks in the neighbouring Blida province , about 50 km ( 40 miles ) south of Algiers , according to newspaper reports . The escalation coincided with reports that more than 140 members of the feared Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) had been killed by troops in the same region while they were meeting to plot strategy to step up their campaign against the government . The authorities blame the GIA for the massacres and other killings of civilians in Algeria . About 60 , 000 people have been killed in Algeria since January 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead .

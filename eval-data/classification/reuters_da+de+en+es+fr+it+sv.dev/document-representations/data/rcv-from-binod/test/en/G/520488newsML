Taiwan destroyer collides with China fishing boat . A Taiwan naval destroyer and a fishing boat from China collided in Taiwan ' s territorial waters , the navy said on Friday . The U . S . - made destroyer was patrolling about 28 nautical miles off Taiwan ' s western Taichung harbour early on Friday when it encountered and sought to expel the mainland vessel , a navy statement said . The statement said the fishing boat " hit the destroyer " and then attempted to make a getaway , the statement said . The destroyer suffered minor damage , it added , but gave no details of damage to the fishing boat . A Taiwan coastguard vessel helped escort the fishing boat out of its territorial waters . Taiwan ' s state - funded Central News Agency said the navy would ask the semi - official Straits Exchange Foundation to seek compensation from the mainland on its behalf . The narrow strait separating Taiwan and China is the source of conflicting maritime territorial claims and has seen many minor flare - ups in recent years . Taiwan has declared a 200 - nautical - mile economic zone in the waters , which overlaps China ' s claims . China views Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war spilt them in 1949 . Beijing has accused Taiwanese troops of repeatedly intercepting Chinese fishing boats , assaulting fishermen and destroying their equipment . Taiwan insists it has the right to expel vessels that enter its waters to safeguard its territorial integrity .

Belgian police have files on 13 missing children . Police investigating Belgium ' s scandal of child kidnapping , porn and killing that has stunned Europe have files on 13 children who have gone missing over the past 10 years , a senior official said on Wednesday . " Our first mission is looking for bodies . We don ' t know how many there could be , " Gendarmerie Commander Johan Dewinne told reporters after police spent a fruitless day digging at a house owned by Marc Dutroux , the man at the centre of the inquiry . " We are working on 13 dossiers on missing children from the past 10 years , " Dewinne , head of Belgium ' s disaster investigation team and leading the hunt for corpses , said . Belgium was plunged into shock on August 17 as Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight - year - old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of another house he owns . With them lay accomplice Bernard Weinstein , whom he admitted killing . Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean - Marie Boudin said digging would resume on Thursday , and Dewinne said he hoped to wrap up excavations at the house in Jumet , a suburb of the southern city of Charleroi , by Friday evening . He said in all 11 sites would be systematically searched . As the scandal reverberated around the country , the lawyer of convicted child rapist Dutroux refused to defend him . " I have a little girl of Julie and Melissa ' s age , who has been really disturbed by these events , and I don ' t think she could have understood that her father was defending this man , " lawyer Didier de Quevy told Belgian radio . Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment . Two other girls , Laetitia Delhez , 14 , and Sabine Dardenne , 12 , were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the six houses Dutroux owns in and around Charleroi . Dutroux has also confessed to kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrechts who disappeared from the port of Ostend a year ago . Their fate remains unknown . Battling against heavy rain on Wednesday , investigators dug in several places in the yard of the Jumet house and are due on Thursday to begin investigating the rubble - filled basement . Britain ' s Superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West " House of Horrors " murder case in England two years ago , was present on Wednesday . There were also fresh searches at other sites including the house in Sars - La - Buissiere where Melissa and Julie were hidden . Dutroux said the girls , who disappeared in June 1995 , starved to death early this year , He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40 , 000 francs ( $ 1 , 300 ) to kidnap them . They were buried in the eastern city of Liege on Thursday after what amounted to a state funeral amid outpourings of grief and anger . As the searches continued in Belgium , Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman . The Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman . So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the " Dutroux Affair " , including Dutroux ' second wife Michelle Martin who has been charged as an accomplice . Martin and Lelievre were interrogated again on Wednesday . There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling , and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry . A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges , fuelling questions about a possible high - level cover - up . There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .

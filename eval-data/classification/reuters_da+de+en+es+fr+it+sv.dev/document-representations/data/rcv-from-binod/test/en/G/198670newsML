Needles stuck in Cyprus baby ' s brain and liver . Cyprus police launched an inquiry on Monday to discover who has been sticking needles into a 22 - month - old child and why , a spokesman said . The little girl is living with a sewing needle in her brain and another in her liver . " There is no problem with the child at all , she is developing normally and is completely well , " her doctor Simos Kyriakides told Reuters . The child is the eldest of two children of a couple living at a village in the south eastern Larnaca district . She has had two operations to date for the removal of sewing needles stuck in her thigh and lower abdomen , the doctor said . " My assumption is that all the needles were stuck in her at the same time , when she was six to eight months old , " said Kyriakides . " They were found as we were going along . "

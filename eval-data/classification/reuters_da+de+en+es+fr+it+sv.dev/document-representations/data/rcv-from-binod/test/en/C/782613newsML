Dow pulls out of doldrums , closing at record high . Blue - chip stocks rallied on Wednesday after four lackluster sessions and technology issues got a boost from a surprise peace pact between former bitter rivals Apple Computer Inc . and Microsoft Corp . The Dow Jones industrial average rose 71 . 77 points to 8 , 259 . 31 , eclipsing the old record of 8 , 254 . 89 set last Wednesday . The Nasdaq composite index , laden with high - tech stocks , rose 8 . 91 to 1 , 630 . 44 , another new high . " I think today probably surprised even the bulls and helped batter the bears , " said Alfred Goldman , technical analyst at A . G . Edwards and Sons . Investors said blue - chip issues benefited as interest rates stabilised in the bond market . Long - term rates had jumped since Friday after unexpectedly strong economic reports pointed to inflationary pressures building in the economy . " This is the first day the bonds have stabilised , " said Bruce Bittles , market strategist at J . C . Bradford . " That helped the market . " The 30 - year Treasury rose an eighth of a point , lowering its yield , which moves in the opposite direction , to 6 . 48 percent from 6 . 49 percent on Tuesday . In the broader market , advancing issues beat decliners 1 , 836 to 976 on active New York Stock Exchange volume of 565 million shares . The market also got a boost from startling news that Apple and Microsoft were ending their bitter rivalry , with Microsoft investing $ 150 million in Apple , which had racked up more than $ 1 . 6 billion in losses over the past 18 months . Apple also revamped its board of directors . The Apple news " showed the company is turning around and Microsoft has some degree of confidence in it , " Goldman said . " I think that makes everybody feel good . " Apple jumped 6 - 9 / 16 to 26 - 5 / 16 and was the most active issue on Nasdaq stock . Microsoft rose 1 / 8 to 143 - 7 / 16 . The news helped extend the rally in tech stocks , which have been the market leaders in the past week . Semiconductor maker Intel Corp . rose 3 / 8 to 100 - 1 / 16 , closing above 100 for the first time since a 2 - for - 1 split in July . International Business Machines Corp . added 1 - 1 / 4 to 107 - 13 / 16 and Adobe Systems gained one to 40 - 1 / 4 . However , computer networking stocks failed to take part in the rally after industry leader Cisco Systems posted second - quarter earnings that met average forecasts but failed to meet the most optimistic expectations . Cisco fell 1 - 9 / 16 to 80 - 3 / 8 . 3Com Corp . lost 15 / 16 to 54 - 1 / 2 and Ascend Communications fell 13 / 16 to 52 - 3 / 8 . Financial stocks gained on the bond market strength and favourable comments on some banking shares from Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter .

Seagram beverages and music groups boost profit . Better results from its spirits , wine and music businesses boosted fourth - quarter earnings at Seagram Co . Ltd . , the beverages and entertainment company said on Wednesday . Montreal - based Seagram said net income for the fourth quarter ended June 30 rose to $ 148 million , or 40 cents a share , from $ 89 million , or 22 cents a share , a year earlier . Revenues rose to $ 3 billion from $ 2 . 9 billion . For the full year , Seagram ' s net profit rose to $ 502 million , or $ 1 . 36 a share , from $ 142 million , or 37 cents a share , a year earlier . Revenues increased to $ 12 . 6 billion from $ 12 billion . The 1997 fourth - quarter net profit figure included a $ 100 million after - tax gain on the sale of 30 million Time Warner Inc . shares in the latest fourth quarter , compared with a $ 67 million after - tax gain a year earlier on a settlement reached with the U . S . government regarding a 1981 share transaction . Analysts said the company ' s latest fourth - quarter net income before special items of $ 48 million , or 13 cents a share , was in line with expectations . The year - earlier net profit before gains was $ 22 million , or 5 cents a share . " They came in line with consensus and a couple cents better than our estimates , " said Jill Krutick , entertainment analyst at Smith Barney . Seagram said pretax earnings at its 80 percent - owned Universal Inc . entertainment unit increased 36 percent , due largely to a turnaround in the music group and strong performance in the company ' s recreation and theme park operations . Filmed entertainment pretax profits were mainly flat despite brisk ticket sales for blockbuster films such as Stephen Spielberg ' s " The Lost World " and " Liar Liar " , a comedy starring Canadian Jim Carrey . Japan ' s Matsushita Electric Industrial Co . holds the remaining 20 percent of Universal . In a statement , Seagram President and Chief Executive Edgar Bronfman Jr . said the company ' s Spirits and Wines group posted strong results because of growth in several key brands in North America , including Captain Morgan Rum and Crown Royal Canadian Whisky , and because of benefits from the group ' s restructuring . Seagram ' s Tropicana Beverage Group had an " excellent year , " mainly because of sales of its Pure Premium juice brand in North America , Bronfman said . Seagram shares slipped C $ 1 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday to C $ 48 . 00 , after a C $ 1 . 40 decline on Tuesday . On the New York Stock Exchange , Seagram fell 81 cents to $ 34 . 44 . Analyst Krutick said investors were expecting the company to extract better returns from its operating assets , especially its music labels . " They have a very clean balance sheet and a fair amount of financial flexibility , and the market is eager to see them put it to good use , " Krutick said .

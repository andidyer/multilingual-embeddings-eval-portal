SOCCER - ARGENTINA SCORE LAST - GASP WIN OVER CHILE . Argentina scored twice in the last five minutes to beat Chile 2 - 0 in yet another uninspiring group A game in the Copa America Saturday . The 8 , 000 fans scattered around near empty terraces had to endure a night of cold and dismal soccer in a group which has yet to provide an entertaining match . Argentina appeared set to complete a second game without scoring until the 85th minute when Sergio Berti was freed on the left of the Chilean penalty , in what appeared an offside position , and scored with a powerful low drive . Two minutes later , Marcelo Gallardo secured Argentina ' s win with a second goal . Both countries have brought below - strength teams , saving their top players instead for World Cup qualifiers . The result left Argentina and Ecuador on four points , Paraguay on three and Chile , who have not scored a goal , on none with one game each left to play . None of the teams have either qualified for the quarter - finals or been eliminated .

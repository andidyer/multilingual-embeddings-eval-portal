TV company taps growing European junk bond market . Expanding broadcaster Central European Media Enterprises on Thursday launched its first bond , giving investors a rare chance to buy high - yielding corporate debt in German marks . The well - received 140 million mark seven - year bond , sold along with a $ 100 million seven - year U . S . offering , was priced to yield 312 . 5 basis points more than German government bonds . CME , a Bermuda corporation which owns and operates a string of television stations in central and eastern Europe , is headed by Ronald S . Lauder , an heir to the Estee Lauder family fortune . The company is also one of a handful of borrowers tapping into the fledging European junk bond market , a sector which is expected to see more growth this year . CME has been able to get better terms for its bond than previous issuers . " This deal was priced significantly tighter than the previous ones , " a banker familiar with the bond said . " It is a sign of a maturing market . Also , this is not a heavily leveraged transaction , but a strong stand - alone company doing its first debt offering . The company has a strong European credit story , " he said . CME is active in television and radio in the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Romania , Ukraine and Poland . CME started up in February 1994 with the launch of Nova TV in the Czech Republic , where the company says it now has more than 55 percent of the market share . It is rated B1 by Moody ' s Investors Service and B + by Standard & Poor ' s , both in the " speculative grade " category . In April the first European junk bonds , so - called because the paper is not rated or is well below investment grade , were launched . A 175 million mark seven - year bond launched by Exide Holding Europe , rated B1 / B , is the most directly comparable to the CME issue . It was launched to yield 3 . 75 points over Bunds . Sanitary plumbing systems maker Geberit International issued 157 . 5 million marks to fund a leveraged buy - out , and Impress Metal Packaging ' s 200 million mark deal was launched for the same reason . European companies have actively raised debt in the U . S . market , where outstanding junk bonds exceed $ 200 billion . But European investors have been reluctant to take on such credit exposure . That has been changing due to external factors . Interest rates for many major currencies are at historically low levels , and investors are finding little yield pickup by going from one European currency to another . Many are therefore turning to credit risk to boost returns . " The appetite for high - yielding corporate debt in Europe is higher than the supply of deals , " a Frankfurt - based banker said . " Many companies are still finding cheaper alternatives to junk bonds . " Traditional bank loans are still popular for European companies , who also rely heavily on mezzanine financing . One junk bond specialist said although the rate of interest charged on bank loans was often lower than rates in the bond market , bonds still offered benefits . " Bank loans have limits on your ability to draw down money or limits on operating and financial flexibility because of aggressive covenant packages , " he said . Bankers said CME had originally planned to borrow in dollars using a deferred coupon bond , which was why it had obtained U . S . Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) clearance for a deal . " When we got into the details of the company ' s finances , we realised they were stronger than expected in terms of cash flows , and were able to accommodate a cash - paying bond , " a banker said . " It became obvious to move into the mark market , but since it had already started marketing in dollars , CME decided to issue dollars and marks together , " he said . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7748 ( $ = 1 . 831 German Marks )

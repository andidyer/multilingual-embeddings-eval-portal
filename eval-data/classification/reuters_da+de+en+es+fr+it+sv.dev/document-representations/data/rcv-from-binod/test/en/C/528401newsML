PS Colorado sets prorated dividend . Public Service Co of Colorado said Tuesday directors declared a prorated dividend in anticipation of receiving second quarter 1997 approval of the company ' s merger with Southwestern Public Service Co . The dividend will accrue at a pre - calculated daily rate from April 12 , the day following the last record date for dividends paid on the company ' s common stock , through the day prior to merger completion . If the merger had not been completed on or before July 1 , 1997 , this dividend declaration would no longer be in effect . Instead , the board would reconsider the anticipated merger timing and declare a dividend and set a new record date as appropriate , the company said . Following the merger , the directors of New Century Energies would establish its ongoing dividend policy . As previously disclosed , it is anticipated that New Century initially will pay annual common stock dividends of $ 2 . 32 per share , subject to evaluation by directors .

Ssangyong restructuring aimed at auto unit . South Korea ' s Ssangyong Group on Wednesday announced plans to restructure its business and trim affiliates , but analysts said that may not be enough to save the conglomerate ' s ailing vehicle unit . " The group ' s business focus will be placed on its auto and information sectors , " Cho nam - do , vice president of the Ssangyong Group , told Reuters . " Ssangyong is seeking to sell assets left idle and readjust its investment programmes . " Ssangyong , the country ' s sixth largest business group , would reduce the number of its subsidiaries from 25 to 21 by the end of this year through mergers and sell - offs , Cho said . Analysts said the restructuring plan was aimed at helping the group ' s debt - stricken automobile unit , Ssangyong Motor Co Ltd , but that it may not be enough . The group ran into financial troubles after Ssangyong Motor poured money into developing new model cars in a technical tie - up with Mercedes - Benz , a subsidiary of Daimler - Benz , they said . The German auto maker has a 2 . 6 percent stake in Ssangyong Motor , a specialised maker of four - wheel - drive utility vehicles . Ssangyong poured about two trillion won ( $ 2 . 24 billion ) into developing several new models over the past five years , including the Musso and New Korando utility vehicles , and Chairman luxury sedans , which will go on sale late this year . Analysts estimated Ssangyong Motor ' s debts at 3 . 7 trillion won at the end of 1996 . The company put its debts at 3 . 2 trillion won . Ssangyong paid more than 300 billion won in interest annually on the debts , analysts said . " The Ssangyong Group seems to be gathering all its forces to save the motor unit . But given the sheer size of the debt , the restructuring plan looks like nothing , " said Chang Choon - rin , an analyst at Daewoo Research Institute . Two weeks ago , Ssangyong Motor said it would sell its headquarters building and other assets to raise about 400 billion won . The auto maker posted a net loss of 228 . 5 billion won in 1996 , against a 126 . 2 billion loss in 1995 . " In the long run , Ssangyong Motor may have to chop off all segments ( except ) its utility vehicle production , in which the company maintains a competitive edge , " said Kim Byung - joon , an analyst at Dongwon Economic Research Institute . Under the restructuring plan , Ssangyong said in a statement Ssangyong Heavy Industries Co Ltd , producer of diesel engines and other auto parts , would absorb Ssangyong Precision Industry Co Ltd , also a maker of vehicle parts . " We hope to cut production costs and raise efficiency through the merger , " Cho said . To strengthen its construction business , Ssangyong Engineering Co Ltd , responsible mainly for designs and inspections , is to be integrated into Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Co Ltd . Ssangyong Research Institute is to be merged into Ssangyong Investment and Securities Co Ltd . The group also plans to sell off its transportation arm , Dongsung Express Tourist Co Ltd . " We will continue to trim down businesses with little hopes of growth , " Cho said ( $ 1 = 892 . 10 won )

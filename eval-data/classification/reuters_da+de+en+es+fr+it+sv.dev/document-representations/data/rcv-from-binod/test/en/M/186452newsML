Feeder cattle showed early strength on another advance in the CME Feeder Cattle Index , the barometer of cash feeder cattle prices , and on lower corn futures . However , feeders continued to retreat unevenly late following developing strength in corn futures . Corn futures rallied further late which weighed on January feeders again at the close , traders said .

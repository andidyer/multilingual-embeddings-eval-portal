CME traders say USDA data neutral for live cattle . Chicago Mercantile Exchange livestock traders said the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s Cattle Inventory data released late Friday appeared neutral for CME live cattle futures . They said the U . S . cattle herd of 101 . 209 million head , or 98 percent of a year ago , was in line with expectations . Analysts ' pre - report estimates for the total number of U . S . cattle had averaged 98 . 1 percent of a year ago , in a range of 97 . 0 to 100 . 2 percent . Cattle futures should show little reaction to the report during Monday ' s trading , but feeder cattle futures could trade steady to 0 . 25 cent per lb higher , analysts said . However , feeder cattle may draw light support from the data , which showed the supply of heifers , steers , and bulls under 500 lbs as of January 1 at 17 . 688 million head , or 96 percent of a year ago . That was less than analysts ' estimates which ranged from 97 to 100 percent . USDA figures in other report categories were in line with analysts ' expectations . USDA reported cows and heifers that calved at 43 . 561 million head , or 98 percent of a year ago , versus trade estimates of 96 . 2 to 98 percent . The 1996 calf crop at 39 . 586 million head was 98 percent of a year ago versus trade estimates from 96 . 2 to 100 percent . ( ( Chicago newsdesk 312 - 408 - 8720 ) )

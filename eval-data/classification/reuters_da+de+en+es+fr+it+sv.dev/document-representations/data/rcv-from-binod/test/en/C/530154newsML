Jinro defaults on debt payments . South Korea ' s troubled Jinro Ltd has defaulted on promissory notes and cheques , an official at Jinro ' s prime creditor bank said on Tuesday .

Usually a company default on debt payments automatically leads to a suspension of all the company ' s bank accounts . The Commercial Bank said on Monday it would bail out Jinro Ltd and five other Jinro Group ' s affiliates . The Jinro Group , the nation ' s 19th largest conglomerate , said last week it was selling off some of its property and affiliates to raise cash for debt repayments . Jinro Ltd officials declined to comment .

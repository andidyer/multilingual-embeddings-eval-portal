Israel to reconsider venture capital fund tax . Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky has proposed a tax exemption for foreign institutions investing in venture capital funds in Israel , the ministry said . Sharansky has submitted the proposal to Finance Minister Dan Meridor . Currently , foreign intitutional investors such as pension funds must pay anywhere from 15 to 40 percent tax on such an investment in Israel , depending on the amount of profit , a ministry spokesman said . He said Israeli pension and insurance funds are not permitted to invest in venture capital funds . Sharansky said in a statement that increased participation of foreign institutional investors in Israeli venture capital funds would stimulate the technology sector . Acting director general of the ministry Joshua Gleitman said foreign institutions have avoided investing in Israeli venture capital funds because they are exempt from taxes on such investments in the United States , for example . - Tel Aviv newsroom , 972 - 3 - 537 - 2211

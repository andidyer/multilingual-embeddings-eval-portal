Moscow , Chechen rebels vow to pursue peace . Russian and separatist leaders vowed on Monday to work hard for peace in Chechnya following the sacking of Moscow ' s chief negotiator , Alexander Lebed , but made clear that deep gulfs remained between them . Rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev said in a television interview that the separatists regretted Thursday ' s dismissal of Lebed , who signed a peace deal with them on August 31 . But he said they were ready to negotiate with Ivan Rybkin , Lebed ' s successor as President Boris Yeltsin ' s envoy to Chechnya and as secretary of the president ' s influential Security Council . " We express our regret that Lebed was not given the chance to finish what he had started , " Yandarbiyev said in an interview with NTV commercial television . " Rybkin and Lebed are different people but we won ' t link the results of the peace process with personalities . " His remarks , and similarly moderate comments by other rebel leaders , have partially eased fears that Lebed ' s sacking will provoke new fighting in a conflict which killed tens of thousands of people before the signing of the peace deal . Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , addressing a maeeting in Moscow , also said the only way forward was through negotiations . " We do not need war . We will hold negotiations and move further in that direction , " Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying as he presented Rybkin to the Security Council , grouping top defence , security and state officials . Chernomyrdin and Rybkin have both said they back the peace moves made by Lebed , despite fierce criticism of the agreements by Russian parliament . Some deputies said it was tantamount to capitulation by Moscow . But Moscow and the rebels remained firmly entrenched on Chechnya ' s demands for independence - - the central dispute in a conflict which flared when Moscow sent troops to try to quell the region ' s separatist drive in December 1994 . " We are not a part of Russia . We are still in a state of war with Russia , " Yandarbiyev told NTV in an interview carried out in Chechnya . " There is much left to do , there are many unsolved problems ( such as ) the full withdrawal of Russian troops which must be carried out to the last soldier . " Chernomyrdin flatly ruled out secession for the small , mountainous region in southern Russia . " Russia ' s territorial integrity is not up for discussion , " Itar - Tass news agency quoted him as saying . " Ahead of us lies some very careful work - - we can ' t just go charging in . . . We think there should be understanding for all sides , including the Chechens . There will be understanding and there will be a solution . " Under the agreement signed on August 31 , most Russian troops are to withdraw from Chechnya , local elections are to be held and a final settlement on how to define Chechnya ' s status - - in or out of Russia - - has been put off for five years .

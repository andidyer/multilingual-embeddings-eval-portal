FOCUS - British Gas to stick to gas supply . British Gas said on Monday it planned to stick with its domestic gas supply business after earlier ending talks to divest part of the operations to Scottish Hydro - Electric Plc . " This was a one - off deal , " a British Gas spokeswoman said on the talks , which were halted on the initiative of both companies . " We absolutely have no intention to sell off part of the operation and there are no other deals in the offing , " she added . Her comments followed a terse statement on Sunday in which British Gas and Scottish Hydro said they had broken off talks after the Sunday Telegraph reported that the two firms were discussing a deal worth 250 million pounds ( $ 390 million ) . Scottish Hydro had approached British Gas a couple of months ago to buy the domestic gas supply business in Scotland and northern England , British Gas said on Monday . But it declined to make any comments on the reported value of the discussed deal . Industry regulator Ofgas had been consulted but British Gas said it and Scottish Hydro failed to reach an agreement due to commercial reasons rather than to regulatory pressure . " We looked at it very seriously but still decided it was not in the best interest of the company , " the spokeswoman said . She added there had been no talks with other companies than Scottish Hydro . " I don ' t think you would find another proposition on the table anyway which offered the same attributes that this one had , " the spokeswoman said without elaborating . According to stock market talk earlier this year , several major oil companies were said to be eyeing British Gas ' s struggling gas supply business . The rumours were most prominent when British Gas in February announced plans to demerge in 1997 , separating gas supply from its money spinner TransCo , which is responsible for the pipeline and storage operations . TransCo is currently subject to a crucial price review by Ofgas and British Gas has until October 7 to decide whether it will accept the regulator ' s tough proposals or have the matter vetted by the Monopolies and Merger Commission . The loss - making gas supply business is , meanwhile , undergoing drastic changes as competition hots up . The market to supply big industrial users was already opened up several years ago , triggering a collapse of British Gas ' s market share to around 35 percent . The utility , privatised 10 years ago , is doing better in the domestic consumer market . In a pilot project started in April in the south west of England , some 70 , 000 consumers out of a total 500 , 000 households have switched to rivals . Competition in the south east of England is scheduled to be introduced in January and February , while the rest of Britain will follow the year after . The speedy introduction of competition has created big problems for British Gas , which is obliged to buy fixed amounts of gas from North Sea producers even if it cannot find a market . The company is currently in talks to soften the impact of the contracts . The Sunday Telegraph reported that British Gas was expected to announce a deal with British Petroleum and Royal Dutch / Shell Group on the take - or - pay matter within the next month . But the British Gas spokeswoman said this was speculation . ( $ 1 = . 6405 Pound )

SBC long - distance bid runs into problems . SBC Communications Inc . ' s bid to be the first Baby Bell to enter the $ 80 billion long - distance business was thrown into doubt Wednesday after an Oklahoma regulator said the carrier failed to meet key terms for entry . A state administrative law judge told the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ' s three commissioners that SBC , the San Antonio , Texas - based parent of Southwestern Bell , had not met a federal checklist showing the carrier had opened its local phone network to competitors . The OCC is the state ' s top phone regulator , and acceptance of the administrative law judge ' s recommendation could scuttle SBC ' s bid . The administrative law judge issued the findings Tuesday after a hearing on the matter . " It certainly doesn ' t help SBC , " attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson said of the administrative law judge ' s findings . " And if it is sustained by the ( OCC ) , it would be the kiss of death for SBC ' s application . " The OCC must make its own recommendation to the Federal Communications Commission by May 1 on whether SBC should be allowed to offer long - distance service from the state . Under the 1996 communications law , SBC and the the other regional Bells must meet a 14 - point checklist showing they had opened their local monopolies before gaining FCC approval . Chicago - based Ameritech Corp . was forced earlier this year to withdraw its own long - distance application because of numerous errors . Aside from state regulators , the FCC must consult with the Justice Department over SBC ' s 5 , 000 - page application to offer long - distance service from Oklahoma . The application was made last Friday . SBC noted the administrative law judge , Robert Goldfield , issued an oral ruling Tuesday and must still issue a detailed written finding . " At this point , it ' s unclear what specific questions or concerns he has about our application . Given that , we ' re not going to comment on it , " said SBC Executive Vice President Jim Ellis . The carrier is confident it ultimately will prevail . It is not known how much weight the three - member OCC will put on Goldfield ' s findings . But experts said it is a setback for SBC . The carrier must now now try to convince the agency to overturn its own administrative law judge at a hearing on April 23 . Industry and Oklahoma officials opposing SBC ' s bid said the carrier had not yet opened its local phone monopoly to competitors such as long - distance carriers AT & T Corp . and MCI Communications Corp . , as well as other new rivals . A Brooks Fiber Properties Inc . executive told Tuesday ' s hearing that - - contrary to SBC ' s claim - - St . Louis - based Brooks is not providing local phone service to residential customers in Oklahoma . " We believe the application is extremely premature . We think it is unfortunate that ( SBC ) has felt compelled to file it at such an early stage . It puts the state and federal regulators under an unnecessary and time - consuming exercise , " said Edward Cadieux , director of regulatory affairs at Brooks Fiber , a special provider of local service . Said AT & T spokesman Kerry Hibbs , " In Oklahoma , consumers don ' t have a choice for local phone service . " On the New York Stock Exchange , SBC shares closed up 75 cents at $ 52 . 125 .

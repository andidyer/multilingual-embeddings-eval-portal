Taiwan takes aim at unapproved China investments . Taipei on Tuesday pledged to get tough with local businesses and people who invest in projects in rival China without Taiwan government approval . " We are giving a three - month grace period to investors from today to report unapproved investment projects in the mainland , Hsu Chin - fu , of the economic ministry ' s investment commission , told Reuters . " Those caught after October 1 will be punished , " Hsu said . " Violators will be forced to stop their mainland projects and pay fines ranging from T $ 1 - 5 million ( US $ 36 , 000 - 180 , 000 ) . " Under the newly revised Mainland - Taiwan Relations Act , all investors must report their investments in China , a rival of Taiwan since a civil war split them in 1949 . Since a late 1980s political thaw , some 30 , 000 Taiwan firms - - with or without state approval - - have poured over US $ 30 billion into the mainland , routing their investments through third areas , principally Hong Kong . Hong Kong became a special administrative region of China on Tuesday , ending more than 150 years of British rule . Taipei vowed in May to tighten Taiwan investment in China as long as Beijing remained hostile to the island . China staged a series of war games in 1995 and 1996 in a bid to cool Taiwan independence sentiment . It suspended semi - official talks with Taipei in mid - 1995 while alleging that the island was pushing for independence rather than national reunification .

Mark , yen profits on SAfrica bonds 20pct since Jan . Japanese and German investors holding South African rand bonds have already made a profit in yen and mark terms of around 20 percent this year , according to life assurance giant Old Mutual . The rand has strengthened some 14 percent against the mark and the yen since the end of 1996 while long bond yields have tumbled 1 . 3 percentage points . Each one point fall in the yield is equivalent to a price increase of about five percent in rand terms . The strong dollar means U . S . investors have done less well . The rand has appreciated by just under six percent against the U . S . currency this year . Mark Le Roux , portfolio manager of Old Mutual Unit Trusts ' Gilt Fund , said he expected heavy foreign buying of South African bonds to continue , reflecting an abrupt change in sentiment by offshore investors . Most of the foreign buying , totalling 2 . 808 billion rand so far this year , was in the R150 and R153 stocks . Le Roux said the perception that the rand ' s slide was over had attracted overseas fund managers into local gilts . Yields could kick up in the short term due in reaction to recent strong gains , but the bull trend should remain intact . South African long bonds moved to their best levels in seven months early on Monday , with the yield on the benchmark R150 issue below 14 . 90 percent , buoyed by far better - than - expected January gold and foreign exchange reserves . - - Johannesburg newsroom + 27 11 482 1003

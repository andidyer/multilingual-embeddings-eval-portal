Sudan says it killed 17 Ethiopians on rebel front . Sudan said on Saturday it had repelled invading Ethiopian forces , killing 17 soldiers and wounding several in clashes in the southeast of the country . " At the operations theatre , the armed forces scored a new victory on Tigrean ( Ethiopian ) pockets who sustained 17 killed and tens wounded and several pieces of their equipment destroyed , " the government - owned Sudan al - Hadith newspaper said . The government in Sudan called earlier this month for all available volunteers to defeat an invasion from Ethiopia backing a rebel offensive . The newspaper did not say when the clash took place . There have been no independent accounts of the fighting in eastern Sudan and it is difficult to assess the veracity of reports issued by the two sides . The Arabic - language daily added that Ethiopian troops were retreating " in the face of the advance of our forces on all fronts " . Sudan says Ethiopian troops are fighting alongside Sudanese rebels in the southeast . It also says Eritrea is abetting other rebels further north and expects a third front to open on the borders with Uganda . Khartoum has accused the United States , which wants tighter sanctions on Sudan for its alleged support of terrorism , of backing its three hostile African neighbours . Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied Sudan ' s charges and the rebels , members of the National Democratic Alliance which groups both southern and northern opposition groups , say they are behind the fighting . The rebels say they are advancing on the key southeastern town of Damazin where the government is massing troops for a counterattack . The town lies near the Roseires Dam , which provides Khartoum with most of its electricity . The rebels say their aim is to take Damazin to put pressure on Sudan ' s Islamist government and spark a popular uprising . Rebel leader John Garang has said his troops were just 20 km ( 13 miles ) away from the dam . But their advance seems to have lost momentum and journalists visiting the site on Friday and Saturday could not see any rebel troops . Sudan reported on Friday that rebels on the northeastern front had attacked government troops for the first time in more than a week and had inflicted heavy losses . An official Sudanese daily did not say when the clash took place . Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir visited Damazin on Friday . Many Khartoum - based analysts took this as a signal of the beginning of the counter - offensive . The government has denied reports of most rebel advances but has conceded that they have taken over Qeissan and Kurmuk , two small towns on the Ethiopian border . The rebels say they have taken the governor of Kurmuk and several other officials hostage . Al - Sudan al - Hadith said on Saturday that two of these men had died , but did not say how or when they died . The daily named the officials as Rabei Ahmed Kurmino , chairman of the town council , and Ismail Mahmoud , local head of the National Congress , the only political system in Sudan . " But the fate of the governor of Kurmuk town is still in the dark , " the daily added .

Bre - X urges stock remain halted until audit . Bre - X Minerals Ltd on Monday urged the Toronto Stock Exchange to keep the stock halted until after Freeport - McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc has finished its due diligence and Bre - X ' s independent consultant Strathcona Minerals completes an audit . Bre - X also said it will be reviewing recent statements about the company and may consider legal action . " John Felderhof and the entire technical team at Busang as well as the Canadian management of Bre - X , has initiated a thorough review of all recent statements and actions by persons , parties and publications responsible for the proliferation of misinformation that has served to tarnish personal reputations and the integrity of the Busang project , with the intent to take legal action where warranted , " Bre - X said in a statement . " I strongly suggest that the stock remain halted until FCX ( Freeport - McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc ) has had the opportunity to complete its due diligence and that Strathcona complete their audit , " Bre - X Chairman , President and Chief Executive David Walsh said in a letter to Toronto Stock Exchange President Rowland Fleming . He said that he told Fleming on Thursday that shareholders would suffer enormously and unnecessarily due to incomplete data available to them if the stock was resumed at that time . Walsh said in the letter during his conversation with Fleming on Thursday he re - iterated that Bre - X stood by its reserve estimates for the deposit and that the company needed time for the independent drill and sampling audit . " During our conversation of March 27 , I implored you not to open Bre - X for trading , my reason being that there was only an hour of trading remaining in the day on your exchange and that , given the dynamics and fluidity of recent events , we could likely have additional pertinent information to provide shareholders by Monday , " Walsh said . " I found your response to my request ' that the subject was not open to debate , ' shocking , " he added . ( ( Reuters Toronto Bureau ( 416 ) 941 - 8100 ) )

Somali gunmen release kidnapped American . Somali gunmen released on Wednesday an American working for the U . S . Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , a spokesman at the U . S . embassy and aid workers in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi said . The spokesman said Daniel Suther , seized by at least eight gunmen in north Mogadishu on Tuesday , was set free on Wednesday morning and was handed over to officials of the Medecines Sans Frontieres ( MSF , Doctors Without Borders ) . But MSF - Spain officials said they understood Suther was set free in Djohar , around 50 km ( 30 . 5 miles ) from Mogadishu . " He was set free . He was not specifically handed over to us , " a MSF - Spain official added . Neither the U . S . embassy spokmesman nor the MSF - Spain official would discuss the whereabouts of the American . On Tuesday , the gunmen disarmed Suther ' s two Somali guards in his four - wheel - drive vehicle and drove off with him and his Somali driver towards the coastal town of Uarsciek , some 50 km ( 30 miles ) northeast of the capital , security sources said . They said Ali Mahdi Mohamed , whose Abgal clan alliance controls north Mogadishu , ordered an Islamic court to seize the kidnappers and also sent two " technicals " , four - wheel - drive battlewagons , to Uarsciek to recover the American . Suther was taken shortly after meeting Ali Mahdi , they said . Kidnappings and extortion , especially involving staff of foreign aid agencies , are common in Mogadishu , where weapons are easily available and unemployment is extremely high since the departure of the U . N . peacekeeping operation in March 1995 . International aid agencies earlier this year pulled all foreign staff out of southern Mogadishu , which is controlled by forces loyal to faction leader Hussein Aideed , but kept some staff in north Mogadishu .

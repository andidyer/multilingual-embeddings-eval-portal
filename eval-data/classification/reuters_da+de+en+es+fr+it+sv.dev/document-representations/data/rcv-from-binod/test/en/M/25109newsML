Italian bonds / futures . Italian bond futures held to easier level in late afternoon after a sharp drop in Treasuries following a surprising rise in the Chicago PMI , but a resilient lira helped limit BTP losses , dealers said . After the strong Chicago data , a 1 . 8 percent rise in July U . S . factory orders showed further signs of strength in the U . S . economy , but many eyes were watching the lira for future direction in the Italian bond market . BTP futures had earlier taken official second quarter Italian GDP figures , slightly lower then forecast , largely in their stride . Official data showed Italian GDP rose by a provisional 0 . 5 percent year - on - year and a fall of 0 . 5 percent on a quarter by quarter basis . The fall in the quarter - on - quarter was largely due to a fall in industrial output , officials said . Dealers said the quarter - on - quarter fall was slightly higher than expected and the year - on year rise less than forecast , but most added that the Bank of Italy was unlikely to move interest rate until the 1997 budget debate was over . After the figures , the director of the national statistics office ISTAT which issued the data , said that the Italian economy was flat but not in recession . " The BTPs have put in a pretty resilient performance considering what ' s happening to other bonds markets , but there is alway the worry of the budget battle just around the corner , " one LIFFE trader said . Dealers said that the good demand at Thursday ' s Italian auction of 10 - year BTPs and seven - year CCT variable rate certificates and further good interest at today ' s auction for three - year and five - year BTPs was helping to support the market . - - Milan newsroom + 392 66129502

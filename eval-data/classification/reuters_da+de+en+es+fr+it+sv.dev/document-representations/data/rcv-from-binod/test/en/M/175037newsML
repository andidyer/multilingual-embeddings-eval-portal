Stocks jump as investors celebrate election results . Stocks jumped to record highs in a post - election party on Wall Street Wednesday as investors bet President Clinton and the Republican - led Congress would keep the economy growing , propelling corporate earnings higher . The dollar fell . Gold also fell and oil edged higher . The Dow Jones industrial average soared to its 32nd record of the year , rising 96 . 53 points to 6 , 177 . 71 . That beat the old record of 6 , 094 . 23 set on Oct . 18 . Investors breathed a collective sigh of relief after voters on Tuesday preserved the split Washington lineup that has overseen steady , if unspectacular , economic growth and a shrinking federal budget deficit . " It looks like a post - election shopping spree , " said Marty Kearney , a trader at PTI Securities . " There were no great surprises in the election and sidelined money wanted to go to work . With a long bond yield of 6 . 61 percent , people are going to stocks . " In the bond market , the benchmark 30 - year Treasury slipped 13 / 32 , or $ 4 . 06 on a $ 1 , 000 bond , and its yield edged up to 6 . 62 percent from 6 . 59 percent on Tuesday . Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction . The Standard & Poor ' s composite index of 500 stocks also set a record , jumping 10 . 45 points to 724 . 59 . The NYSE Composite index rose 5 . 12 to 383 . 55 , also a record . It was the Dow ' s first - ever close above 6 , 100 and the biggest one - day point gain since March 18 , when it jumped 98 . 63 points . In the broader market , advancing issues beat declines 1 , 701 to 756 on heavy volume of 509 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . President Clinton , a Democrat , easily turned back Republican challenger Bob Dole on Tuesday , but the Republican Party held its small majorities in both houses of Congress , setting the stage for continuing moderation in fiscal policy . " The market is happy with the fact there are no big changes . It ' s status quo , " said Richard McCabe , chief technical analyst at Merrill Lynch . As for the near term , McCabe said , " We may get to 6 , 200 or 6 , 300 and then people will take a look . " " My concern is we may be in a later stage or mature stage of the bull market , " he said . " If the market stalls at year - end or early next year , there could be a sizeable 20 percent pullback in 1997 . " Analysts said the stock market was still viewed as the best place for investors to place their money . " We go back to last year ' s argument that there ' s no alternative to stocks with yields this low , " said Richard Cripps , chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker . In currency markets , the dollar fell against the Japanese yen and German mark as traders booked profits after election results came in as had been expected in financial markets .

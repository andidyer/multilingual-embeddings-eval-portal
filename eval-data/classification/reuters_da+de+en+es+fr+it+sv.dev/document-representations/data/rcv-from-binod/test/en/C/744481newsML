FOCUS - Raisio bulls look beyond 1999 . Shares in Finnish food group Raisio Tehtaat surged last week on the promise of future earnings from its cholesterol - cutting agent Benecol , but little of the profit will show until 1999 , analysts say . The Finnish food group ' s patented fat - soluble cholesterol makes it a pioneer in a new wave of so - called " nutraceuticals " firms , which manufacture food products designed to appeal to a mounting demand for people to eat themselves healthy . Unlike some rivals , it has a ready and effective product . Analysts agree the U . S . market for the product among cholesterol - cutting consumers holds huge potential for Raisio , but have mixed views on the share ' s upside now . They add also that it is difficult to value a first - comer to a new sector . News last week Raisio will work with U . S . health care giant Johnson & Johnson to sell Benecol in the United States took its stock to levels justified only by assuming very strong earnings growth in 1999 and onwards , they said . Raisio now trades at price - to - earnings multiples above 50 times analysts ' forecasts for this year , but at upgraded forecasts for 1999 , its P / E ratio is between 20 and 30 which many analysts said is normal for a strong growth stock . " A top growth company could have a P / E of 20 to 30 under normal circumstances , " said Postipankki analyst Pirjo Myllyniemi . Raisio ' s stock added over 70 percent last week on the deal with J & J unit McNeil , peaking at 652 markka on Thursday and after a correction on Friday , found a more steady level closer to 600 markka , trading up 2 . 00 at 625 . 00 on Monday . " In the market ' s view , Raisio is a purely speculative company , " said Carnegie analyst Risto Murto . " This game has gone to the point where you either believe or you don ' t , " he said . Raisio now trades more than 10 times higher than its 50 - 60 markka range before launching Benecol in Finland , but some analysts see further upside . CSFB reissued a buy recommendation when the share traded at 585 markka and set a 12 - month price target of 900 markka . Analysts in a straw poll forecast Raisio ' s earnings per share rising to above 20 markka in 1999 from last year ' s 6 . 13 markka . Many forecasts for this year are also over 10 markka . But they said estimating the full impact that Benecol will have on Raisio ' s earnings is difficult . " The product is new and that causes uncertainty , and the details of the deal with McNeil are still unknown , " Murto said . And it is not easy to find a benchmark to value Raisio , since the food industry is traditionally not fast - growing . The Helsinki stock exchange market p / e is about 15 times 1997 earnings and 11 to 12 times 1998 earnings , Opstock analyst Rami Kinnala said . Food giant Nestle , which targets four percent annual sales growth , trades around 17 times forecast 1998 earnings according to Edinburgh Financial Publishing ( EFP ) consensus forecasts . European pharmaceuticals producers may give a better comparison , but very few offer the same sharp growth prospects as Raisio . Glaxo - Wellcome , facing loss of revenue on its Zantac blockbuster , trades around 23 times 1998 earnings . On the other hand comparing Raisio with booming tech firms like Netscape would sound ridiculous , one analyst said .

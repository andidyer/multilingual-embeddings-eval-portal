Eurotunnel faces insolvency if no debt pact . Eurotunnel SA / Plc would likely be forced to seek insolvency protection if it fails to get shareholder approval for a debt restructuring , French co - chairman Patrick Ponsolle said on Thursday . Ponsolle told Reuters Financial Television that , if Eurotunnel failed to get an extension to its operating licence , shareholders would reject the restructuring package . Asked what would happen , he said : " I think we will go into administration and it ' s very likely that the banks will implement their right for substitution . " " I think there will be very little to be gained by shareholders in that case , that will be one of the major financial failures at the end of this century , " he said . " We clearly believe that an extension of the concession would play an essential role in securing shareholders ' approval , especially French shareholder approval , at the EGM ( extraordinary shareholders meeting ) and we shall remind everyone that , if we don ' t get this approval , then its going to be a very , very large and disappointing financial failure . " Eurotunnel is asking the French and British governments for a concession equal to the 999 - year licence held by the London and Continental Railways consortium to run the British train link . But Ponsolle said he would settle for 99 years . Eurotunnel needed to have an answer from the governments on the licence extension , " say , by June 15 , something around that date , " he said . - - Paris newsroom + 33 1 4221 5452

Vietnam axes foreign firm sponsorship in sports . Vietnam has banned sponsorship of sport and cultural events by foreign tobacco and alcohol firms , an official media report said on Monday . The daily Vietnam News said Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet had announced the measure amid concern that Vietnamese manufacturers were losing out to competition from foreign products . It said the government had also decided to halt all further foreign investment in cigarette production and step up efforts to stop the inflow of smuggled goods from China , Laos and Cambodia . The move brought swift condemnation from industry executives in Ho Chi Minh City , who said the measure was a blow to foreign advertisers already facing significant difficulties . " We haven ' t been told anything so we don ' t know the details , " said an official who declined to be identified . " But we would regard that as actively making it more difficult for us to do business in Vietnam . " Foreign companies in Vietnam face a range of restrictions on their advertising and promotional activities . A recent campaign by U . S . giant Coca - Cola to give mountain bikes to people who collect a prize - winning combination of bottle tops and ring pulls was heavily criticised by state media and banned in southern parts of the country . Vietnam News said that as well as halting foreign sponsorship , the government would seek to help domestic industry by offering " material and spiritual incentives " to the anti - smuggling task force and the public to promote the battle against smugglers . It said government bodies , including the powerful Interior Ministry , had been ordered to work together to detect and stamp out the flow of unofficial trade into Vietnam from abroad , which is estimated at well over $ 1 billion a year . Vietnam ' s lengthy land and sea borders are difficult to police . Smuggled goods are brazenly carted across the frontiers in many places and openly sold throughout the country . But the issue of protection for domestic firms , many of whom suffer from outdated equipment and poor know - how , is also related to government concerns about a trade deficit that in 1996 reached $ 4 billion , equivalent to around 17 percent of gross domestic product . Vietnam , which is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) is committed under the terms of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement to lowering its tariff barriers by 2006 . However , concern about the large scale of the existing deficit has prompted debate about the merits of trade liberalisation and exposing domestic firms to unfettered competition .

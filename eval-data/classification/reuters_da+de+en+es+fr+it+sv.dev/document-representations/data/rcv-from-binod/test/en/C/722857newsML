GE posts record profit for second quarter . General Electric Co . posted its highest - ever quarterly earnings on Thursday and said it was poised to make 1997 the most profitable year in its history . The giant manufacturing and broadcasting company said its net income for the three months ended June 30 rose 13 percent to $ 2 . 162 billion , or 66 cents a share , from $ 1 . 908 billion , or 58 cents a share , in the year - ago period . Revenues , including those from acquisitions , rose to a record $ 22 billion from $ 19 . 1 billion , helped by higher sales of spare parts and services in its equipment businesses . " The quarter ' s double - digit increase again demonstrates the ability of GE ' s diverse mix of leading global businesses to deliver top - line growth , increased margins and strong cash generation , " Chairman John Welch said in a statement . " These strong second - quarter results position GE to deliver another year of record performance in 1997 . " The Fairfield , Conn . - based company , which owns the NBC televsion network , also said its second - quarter operating margin increased to a record 17 . 1 percent of sales , up from last year ' s 16 . 3 percent . GE said that was the 16th consecutive quarterly increase in its operating margin and reflected the company ' s ongoing emphasis on productivity and benefits from its " Six Sigma " quality initiative . The company said 10 of its 12 businesses reported higher operating profit for the quarter , with nine - - led by GE Capital Services , NBC and its aircraft engines unit - - achieving double - digit increases . GE Capital Services ' earnings grew by 17 percent to $ 798 million from $ 683 million , benefiting from the globalization and diversity of the unit ' s 27 businesses . Aircraft Engines won several big , multi - year contracts , including a 10 - year , $ 1 . 6 billion contract from Southwest Airlines Co . Analysts said the strong performance stemmed from GE ' s increased focus on the growth of its services businesses . " They ' re pushing the services side of all their businesses and the earnings and revenues they ' re getting are tremendous , " said Ken Herbert , an analyst at Frost & Sullivan . " Jack Welch has really made this a priority for the company . " With an enormous worldwide base of industrial equipment already in place , GE has turned to maintaining that equipment to boost margins and spur profit growth , analysts said . The strategy gives GE synergy with its current business operations and positions it for future growth , they said . The company has also been " pushing globalization and picking up the pace of acquisitions , " said Lyle Schonberger , an analyst at Olde Discount Corp . GE Capital alone made 11 acquisitions during the second quarter , most of them international . Schonberger said he expects more acquisitions from GE - - and from its GE Capital unit in particular - - especially on the service side . Schoenberger said he expects GE to maintain a roughly 14 percent earnings growth rate for the rest of the year . That would translate into earnings of 61 cents per share for the third quarter and $ 2 . 50 a share for the year . At that rate , Schoenberger added , GE would earn $ 3 . 0 billion on a quarterly basis by late 1999 . GE ' s stock gained $ 1 . 06 to close at $ 69 . 50 on the New York Stock Exchange .

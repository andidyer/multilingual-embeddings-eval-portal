Jordan ' s Arab Potash seeks GDR proposals . Jordan ' s Arab Potash Company has invited global financial institutions to present proposals for a GDR offering worth at least $ 50 million , company officials said on Monday . Arab Potash General Manager Nasser al - Sadoun said the firm had sent invitations to global institutions who had already shown interest in arranging a GDR ( Global Depository Receipt ) listing , to submit proposals within a one month deadline . The majority state - owned firm , one of Jordan ' s top exporters , was targeted in an unprecedented global emerging fund buying spree in Jordan last May , in which at least 500 , 000 stocks of its limited free float shares were snapped up . Arab Potash ' s price shot up over 20 percent to a peak of 7 . 00 dinars from 5 . 700 dinars during the height of foreign demand . Sadoun said the proposals should include the global investment firms ' track records in the Middle East and their proposed pricing range of the GDR offering , expected between 7 to 8 dinars per share . The GDR offering , the first such issue by a Jordanian firm to tap the international equity market , would raise the company ' s international profile and allow it in future to tap cheaper credit for ambitious expansion projects , Sadoun said . Arab Potash said it was considering a minimum $ 50 million GDR issue which would put on offer 3 . 62 million shares left unsubscribed from an earlier public issue , along with a portion of a 57 percent government stake in the firm . Arab Potash , whose authorised capital is 83 . 3 million dinars , has currently a 79 . 7 million dinars paid up capital . The firm is one of the world ' s major producers of potash , a key ingredient in the fertiliser industry , has ambitious plans to develop its downstream industry . As well as the Jordanian government , several Arab states including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have minority holdings . - - Suleiman al - Khalidi , Amman Bureau 9626 - 623776

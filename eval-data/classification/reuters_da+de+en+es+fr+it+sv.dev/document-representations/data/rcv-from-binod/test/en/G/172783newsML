Brief profiles of key Japan cabinet members . The following are brief profiles of key ministers in Japan ' s new cabinet named on Thursday by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto : FINANCE MINISTER - Hiroshi Mitsuzuka , 69 , will have the tough job of handling proposals to trim the power of the Finance Ministry following scandals involving bureaucrats and alleged policy missteps . As transport minister , Mitsuzuka was responsible for the privatisation of the near - bankrupt Japan National Railways in the 1980s . The veteran lawmaker is a former foreign and trade minister and leads one of the factions within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY - Seiroku Kajiyama , 70 , dubbed the " vice shogun " because of his skill in handling government affairs , retained his post . A leading member of the LDP ' s old guard , Kajiyama was instrumental in elevating Hashimoto to the post of LDP president in 1995 . Known as a hawk , Kajiyama last year proposed a grand alliance of the LDP and the main opposition Shinshinto ( New Frontier Party ) in a " national emergency government " should tensions in the Korean Peninsula flare up . He doubles as cabinet coordinator and top government spokesman . FOREIGN MINISTER - Yukihiko Ikeda , 59 , has also been retained because of a pressing foreign policy schedule , including talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov next week and meetings with Chinese and U . S . counterparts at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum session in Manila the following week . Ikeda , a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who married the daughter of ex - prime minister Hayato Ikeda , is a close confidant of Hashimoto . DEFENCE MINISTER - Fumio Kyuma , 55 , takes over the defence portfolio at a crucial time when Japan and the United States are drafting a set of new military cooperation guidelines under the 1960 U . S . - Japan Security Treaty . They are also negotiating reduction of the U . S . military presence on the southern island of Okinawa . A former farm ministry bureaucrat , the soft - spoken Kyuma has mostly kept to intra - party affairs in his 16 - year parliamentary career . ECONOMIC PLANNING MINISTER - Taro Aso , 56 , is the grandson of Shigeru Yoshida , a conservative prime minister who dominated Japanese politics in the immediate post - war period . He took part in the 1976 Montreal Olympics in clay shooting . HEALTH MINISTER - Junichiro Koizumi , 54 , is perhaps the most outspoken member of the new cabinet . As postal minister , he spearheaded drives to privatise the deficit - laden postal service . He has already served twice as health minister and is expected to carry on the reforms initiated by his predecessor , the popular Naoto Kan . Koizumi ran against Hashimoto in the 1995 party election for LDP president and the attempt burnished his image as a future party leader . Koizumi is the grandson of a postal minister and son of a defence minister . TRADE MINISTER - Shinji Sato , 64 , is the second son of Eisaku Sato , Japan ' s longest - serving prime minister since World War Two . Sato is an ex - transport minister who worked for 16 years at a big steelmaker before entering politics . A member of the party old guard , he supported Hashimoto ' s 1995 election as LDP president . Sato also enjoys close ties with Taiwan as head of the Japan - Taiwan Parliamentarians ' League . POSTAL MINISTER - Hisao Horinouchi , 71 , is a leader of the LDP ' s powerful farm lobby . He protected the interests of farm cooperatives who lent heavily to the " jusen " mortgage firms at the centre of a financial scandal earlier this year . Horinouchi takes over the tough job of his ministry ' s efforts to break up telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp and planned telecom market reforms . ENVIRONMENT MINISTER - Michiko Ishii , 63 , is the only woman in the 20 - member cabinet . The LDP ' s first top parliamentary negotiator in the Upper House , she is a former pharmacist known for her work in the field of medicine and welfare .

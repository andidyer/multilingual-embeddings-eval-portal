N . Korea shows no sign of budging in peace meeting . Officials from North and South Korea and the United States made no progress over Pyongyang ' s participation in proposed peace talks during a meeting on Sunday , a Seoul official said on Monday . " Although North Korea called the unscheduled meeting , it showed no change in its earlier position , " South Korea ' s foreign ministry spokesman , Lee Kyu - hyung , told Reuters . Pyongyang delegates , saying they were awaiting directions from home , twice failed to show up for senior - level meetings last week arranged to hear North Korea ' s reply to a proposal for four - nation peace talks . Sunday ' s meeting was between North Korean chief delegate Kim Gye - gwan , his South Korean counterpart Song Young - shik and Mark Minton , who attened on behalf of U . S . chief negotiator Charles Kartman . Minton heads the State Department ' s Korea desk . Lee said a meeting including all delegates from the three countries was due to be held on Monday . " We will see what North Korea has to say in that meeting , " he said . In Washington , a U . S . spokesman said Sunday ' s meeting was to try to arrange the talks on Monday but the three sides failed to reach a conclusion . But Lee said he believed the Sunday discussions were not to arrange a new meeting although they were related to it . On Wednesday , Pyongyang essentially accepted the peace talks proposal but then tied acceptance to demands for additional food assistance , Seoul and Washington officials said . South Korea and the United States , which have pledged $ 6 million and $ 25 million respectively to the latest World Food Programme aid appeal for the famine - hit North , say substantial assistance can be discussed only after Pyongyang sits at the peace table . Seoul has decided to give another $ 10 million or so to the WFP appeal . The exact amount would be decided after the North makes a formal response to the landmark peace talks , a unification ministry official said . In April last year , the United States and South Korea jointly proposed talks with China and North Korea to work out a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula . The 1950 - 53 Korean war halted with a now fraying truce pact and Washington and Seoul want to replace it with a peace treaty . High - level negotiators met in New York on Wednesday and agreed to gather again on Friday . But the North Koreans did not appear for Friday ' s meeting , which was rescheduled for Saturday . They again failed to appear on Saturday . Even if Pyongyang accepts peace talks , negotiations to set up an agenda , date and venue are expected to be lengthy , Seoul officials said .

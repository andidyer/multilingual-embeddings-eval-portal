Zaireans say Tutsi rebels massacre 300 refugees . Tutsi rebels massacred more than 300 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees at a camp 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) southwest of the regional capital Bukavu , local Zaireans said on Monday . Residents of nearby Kakinda village and a survivor said that on November 17 up to 40 rebels gathered 310 refugees at Chimanga camp saying they would be repatriated , and then set off a mortar or a grenade and killed survivors with automatic rifles . Residents , who said they were warned by the rebels to stay silent about the massacre , showed Reuters journalists a series of graves where the villagers had buried bodies , along with several unburied bodies and an injured female survivor hiding in a nearby field . Blood - stained clothes , children ' s and women ' s slippers were left in the square of the camp . Up to 30 , 000 Hutu refugees lived at Chimanga Camp , but most fled last month after fighting broke out between ethnic Tutsi rebels who now control much of eastern Zaire and the Zairean army .

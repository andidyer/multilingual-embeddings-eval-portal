FOCUS - Pound drags down Smith & Nephew profit . British healthcare group Smith & Nephew Plc on Tuesday said persistent pound strength would continue to bite into its profits after an 11 . 75 percent fall in first half results . Pre - tax profit fell as expected to 81 . 1 million pounds ( $ 128 . 3 million ) from 91 . 9 million a year ago . The strong British currency sliced 11 million pounds from the profit figure . Smith & Nephew , whose products range from bandages to artificial limbs , said it saw a similar currency hit in the second half of the year . But the company added the underlying picture was bright with the imminent launch of a revolutionary skin graft product seen giving the group an extra boost in coming years . The new product - - called Dermagraft - - allows living cells derived from babies ' foreskins , whose cells are more active than normal skin , to grow on naturally - absorbable scaffolds across wounds . " It gets Smith & Nephew fairly and squarely on the map in the delivery of biological solutions to particularly difficult wound healing problems , " chief executive Chris O ' Donnell said . Dermagraft , which is targeted at diabetics with serious foot ulcers , will be launched in Britain in October . It will be introduced in other north European countries later in the year . The product will be rolled out across the world in 1998 , O ' Donnell said during a telephone conference call . But Dermagraft profits will only start coming through in 1999 to reach " normal " margins by 2000 and 2001 , O ' Donnell said . Some analysts earlier predicted peak sales of 300 million pounds by 2003 . " It ' s a winner , " said Peter McDougall at broker Kleinwort Benson , echoing a widely held view . He expects Dermagraft to get marketing approval from U . S . drug authorities next month , which would remove the last major hurdle for the product to hit the shelves . Smith & Nephew said on Tuesday it was performing well against its competitors , particularly in the U . S . , where sales grew seven percent in the first half of 1997 . Endoscopy sales rose 12 percent helped by the introduction of a new tissue shaver system , while a series of new artificial knees grabbed a five percent share of the U . S . market , O ' Donnell said . Overall price pressure in the U . S . was subsiding after a very tough 1996 when prices came down three percent . But the decline so far this year was " a bit less than half that , " O ' Donnell said . In sharp contrast to the bright picture in the U . S . , business in Europe deteriorated as governments tightened budgets to meet monetary union requirements . European sales were flat in the first half after nine percent growth in 1996 , O ' Donnell said . But Smith & Nephew has succeeded in winning market share in Germany , while it held or marginally improved its position in France , O ' Donnell said . On the London Stock Exchange , Smith & Nephew shares firmed 1 - 1 / 2 pence to 176 pence . ( $ = 0 . 632 British Pounds )

Phillips plays down Papua pullout . Phillips Petroleum said Friday that its decision to pull out of Papua New Guinea followed a review of a number of factors and had little financial significance to the group . " There were a number of factors involved in Phillips ' decision to withdraw from Papua New Guinea . Phillips ' management reviewed all of these factors and after thorough consideration Phillips elected to withdraw , " said Jeanne Forbis , a spokesman for the company . " It ' s fair to say that our operations there were a very small piece of our wordlwide operations , " she added . Australian oil concern Mosaic Oil NL , which increased its stake in the PPL 163 joint venture in Papua New Guinea to 20 pct from 7 . 7 pct after Phillips pulled out , said Friday that Phillips ' departure was for " non - technical " reasons . About $ 50 million has been spent by the partners so far . Newspapers in Australia said there was speculation that Phillips was unhappy about the shifting legal framework under which it had to operate but Phillips did not comment on specific reasons for the pull out . Phillips , which has a 30 - year association with PNG , had been looking for oil in the country ' s Western Province and drilled two onshore wells which were plugged and abandoned in 1994 and 1995 . The company had plans to drill another well in late 1996 . Mosaic , together with Kerr McGee Corp KMG . Nwhich upped its stake in the joint venture to 80 pct from 34 . 3 pct , will continue to operate and intend to hold discussions with potential farm - in partners . Mosaic said the three projects hold from 135 million to a billion barrels of recoverable oil potentially . Phillips shares were in line with a mixed oil sector early afternoon Friday , down 1 / 4 at $ 42 . - - Tony McAuley , New York Energy Desk , + 1 859 1620

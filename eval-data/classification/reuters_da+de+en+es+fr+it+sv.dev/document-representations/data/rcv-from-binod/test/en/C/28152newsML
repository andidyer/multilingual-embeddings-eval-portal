SocGen sets up Asia commodity finance HQ . Societe Generale , France ' s largest privately - owned bank , said on Monday it has set up the Asian regional headquarters of its Commodity & Trade division ( CAT ) in Singapore . It said Singapore , centrally located and with an already well - established commodity and trade finance team , would be SocGen ' s main centre for Asia , while corporate headquarters in Paris oversaw Europe and New York supervised the Americas . SocGen ' s total credit facility for customers in commodity trading in Singapore is expected to reach S $ 1 . 5 billion this year , compared with S $ 200 million in 1994 . " We finance both oil and commodities , which is important when a barter or a counter trade is needed , " Philippe Fournier , head of the CAT finance department in Singapore , said in a statement . The CAT office in Singapore has six personnel and would add four more by the end of the year , the statement said . SocGen would also appoint CAT staff throughout Asia to serve fast growing markets such as Indonesia , India and China . " Where the commodity markets are not sufficiently developed or large to justify a CAT office , we will serve them from Singapore with the support of our local offices , " Fournier said .

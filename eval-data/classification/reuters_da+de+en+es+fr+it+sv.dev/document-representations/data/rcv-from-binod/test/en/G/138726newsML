Chirac visits self - ruled Palestinian town . French President Jacques Chirac ended a stormy visit to Israel on Wednesday and travelled to the West Bank to deliver the first speech to the Palestinian legislature by a foreign head of state . Thousands of Arabs lined the streets of the self - ruled Palestinian town of Ramallah to welcome Chirac , a vocal advocate of an independent Palestinian state , as his French air force helicopter landed after a short flight from Jerusalem . " Welcome to Palestine , Mr President Chirac , " read a banner at the entrance to the Ramallah governor ' s office , formerly the headquarters of Israeli occupation authorities . Chirac , whose visit to Israel was overshadowed by his shoving match with Israeli bodyguards during a tour of the Old City of Jerusalem on Tuesday , was expected to express support for Palestinian nationalist aspirations in his speech to the 88 - member assembly . Israel and the PLO are currently locked in negotiations on an elusive deal on implementing a long - delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron . Negotiators met through the night , citing progress but announcing no final agreement . U . S . peace envoy Dennis Ross , who had been due to return home on Tuesday but reversed his plan after the talks began to make headway , remained in Israel on Wednesday . A U . S . official said it was unclear when he would leave for Washington . Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed - Rabbo told reporters after the meeting ended early on Wednesday that he was optimistic . " I think there were ideas today that were exchanged which will enable us to close the gap , maybe tomorrow , " Rabbo said . Asked if he thought a summit could be held soon between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , he said : " The summit might take place any day next week . But I can not assure that . . . the main thing is to close the gap and the summit will come . " In what commentators said was a sign talks were getting down to business on thorny security aspects of the partial withdrawal , Israel ' s army chief of staff , Lieutenant General Amnon Shahak , and top PLO official Abu Mazen , also known as Mahmoud Abbas , joined the talks at a Jerusalem hotel . The Hebron talks were decided on at a Washington summit called after 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed in West Bank and Gaza clashes last month . Palestinians view whether the redeployment , set for last March , is implemented as a test of Netanyahu ' s commitment to peace deals signed by the government he ousted in May elections . Netanyahu apologised on Tuesday after Israeli security men jostled Chirac and manhandled journalists as he toured Arab East Jerusalem . A red - faced Chirac , teeth clenched and elbows flailing , had demanded that they leave him in peace to greet Palestinians and visit Christian , Moslem and Jewish holy sites . He later visited the Israeli parliament , where right - wing legislators had criticised his decision to address the Palestinian legislature but not make a speech to the Knesset . After his Ramallah address , Chirac was due to fly to the Gaza Strip accompanied by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and then travel on to Jordan .

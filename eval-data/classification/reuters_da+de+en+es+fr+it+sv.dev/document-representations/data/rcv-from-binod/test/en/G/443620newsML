Sex change theories shaken by boy raised as girl . A boy surgically altered and raised as a girl after his penis was burned off as an infant rebelled and became a man , researchers said on Thursday , casting doubt on long - held medical theories that gender can be " reassigned " after birth . The unidentified man , now in his 20s , was the basis in the past two decades for most theories of " sex reassignment " - - the approach surgeons take when male genitals are badly mutilated at birth . But in a lengthy report in the March issue of the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine , researchers reported the man called " John " was now married and that those theories were questionable . The case first appeared in medical literature in 1972 after the boy , at eight months , lost his penis during an attempted cauterizing repair . It was " accidentally burned to ablation , " the report said . He was studied at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore where , according to accepted theory , it was decided to surgically alter him and raise him as " Joan , " a girl , alongside his twin brother , a normal boy . He had been castrated and preliminary surgery followed . At first it seemed to work . In 1973 Time Magazine said the oft - cited case " provides strong support . . . that conventional patterns of masculine and feminine behaviour can be altered . It also casts doubt on the theory that major sex differences , psychological as well as anatomical , are immutably set by the genes at conception . " But the newly published report said : " The evidence seems overwhelming that normal humans are not psychosexually neutral at birth but are , in keeping with their mammalian heritage , predisposed and biased to interact with environmental , familial , and social forces in either a male or female mode . " The new report was written by Milton Diamond of the John A . Burns School of Medicine in Honolulu and H . Keith Sigmundson of the Ministry of Health , Victoria , B . C . Sigmundson once headed a psychiatric team that handled the case , and Diamond at one point was a consultant for the British Broadcasting Corporation which investigated the case several years ago . Their study said the boy had trouble from the start . His mother reported " Joan " rebelled at wearing dresses , preferred his brother ' s toys to dolls , tried to urinate standing up , liked to play soldier and went for rough and tumble games . Between the ages of nine and 11 , the study said , " Joan " realised she was male . At age 12 " Joan " rejected oestrogen therapy designed for feminization . At the age of 14 " Joan " decided to become " John , " undergoing a mastectomy and phallus construction in the next two years . At 16 he obtained a windowless van with a bed and bar . Girls had crushes on him and at 25 he married a woman several years his senior , adopting her children . " Coitus is occasional with his wife . . . sufficient for his needs but is less than his wife would desire , " the study said . " John can have coital orgasm and ejaculation " but resents that castration deprived him of fatherhood . The researchers said they believe the case shows that any male child with a normal nervous system " should be raised as a male " and that genital surgery , however difficult , should be conducted to assure that is possible .

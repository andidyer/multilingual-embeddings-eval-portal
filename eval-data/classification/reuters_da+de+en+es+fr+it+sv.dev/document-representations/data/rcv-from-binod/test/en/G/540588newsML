Bonn dismisses speculation Kohl plans reshuffle . A German government spokesman on Friday dismissed speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl was planning a cabinet reshuffle before next year ' s general elections .

" German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling , speaking at a regular news conference , referred reporters to remarks Kohl made when asked earlier this month about a possible reshuffle . " As head of the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) , I have no reason to change any CDU ministers . If the Free Democrats ( FDP ) had such a wish then we could talk about it , " he quoted Kohl as saying on April 4 . Solms would not comment on speculation Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt , an FDP member , could lose his job . " I do not make comments about colleagues on principle , " he told Friday ' s Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung daily . A spokesman for Solms told Reuters there was no reason for a debate about cabinet positions , but said the party was prepared for all eventualities .

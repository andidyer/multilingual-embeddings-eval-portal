Turkey ' s flag - mania gets boost with new law . Turkey ' s fervent patriotism is about to get a further fillip from the government with legislation to ensure the blood - red star and crescent stays crisply ironed - and illuminated at night . " This is something prepared in keeping with current conditions and upon great demand recently from the general public , " Interior Minister Mehmet Agar , formerly Turkey ' s police chief , told Reuters on Friday . The government draft bill on the use of Turkey ' s flag follows a series of related high - profile incidents concerning the flag . In one case , Kurdish radicals at the June congress of the legal , pro - Kurdish party ripped down the Turkish flag and raised a banner of the separatist Kurdish guerrillas battling for self - rule in the southeast . Political analysts say the law is the work of the powerful secularist military , which is embroiled in a 12 - year battle with Kurdish rebels and is uneasy about the Islamist - dominated government . " It is actually a military thing . It is a show of strength . . . It is an attempt to protect the system , " Mehmet Ali Birand , columnist with the popular daily Sabah , told Reuters . The bill , expected to become law next month , stipulates that all state organisations , educational institutions , political parties , the offices of village headmen and the vehicles of all Turkish officials display the flag at all times . The flag , which must be illuminated at night , must be raised and lowered with a special ceremony . Every Friday the flag must be replaced with a clean , newly - ironed one and suitable backgrounds against which to place the flag will be specified separately . Suitable backgrounds for the flag will be specified in a separate regulation . And unusable old , torn flags must be burned in a special way , also specified by law . The law also specifies that civilians can display the flag , something that human rights monitors say puts pressure on people to do so or risk being deemed unpatriotic . " This is an oppression - - by saying people may raise the flag at home they are pressuring people to raise the flag or face accusations of being unpatriotic , " said Yavuz Onen , head of the independent Human Rights Foundation . Turkish nationalistic fervour over the flag is nothing new . Ankara nearly went to war with Greece in January after journalists from each country ripped down the other ' s flag from an uninhabited Aegean islet and planted their own . In August , a Greek Cypriot who wanted to take down the Turkish flag on the divided island was fatally shot by Turkish security staff as he climbed up a flagpole next to a Turkish sentry post . The incident prompted warnings by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller that " hands that reach out to our flag will be broken " . She was unmoved by U . S . criticism of her bellicose talk over what Washington said was , after all , just " a piece of cloth . "

Hungary may sell Ikarus to company head ' s group . Hungary ' s privatisation agency APV Rt said on Friday it is considering selling shares in troubled busmaker Ikarus Jarmugyarto Rt to a consortium that includes the company ' s recently appointed president . " The APV could agree to sell some of its shares now or later to a consortium , depending on the price , " an APV official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . The group includes commercial banks and Hungarian electronics group Videoton Holding Rt , which is owned 36 percent by Gabor Szeles , who became the busmaker ' s president in September , the official said . Szeles , the third Ikarus president in two years , is expected to reverse the company ' s losses and sagging sales the way he revived Videoton , once an inefficient state - owned enterprise that is now profitable . Ikarus , the biggest busmaker in the old East bloc during communism , is trying to reverse steep drops in orders since the collapse of its main market , the former Soviet Union , in 1991 . The company built over 13 , 000 buses at its height in 1986 , but its output is expected to reach only 800 units in 1996 . It also expects to report a loss of 3 . 0 - to - 3 . 5 billion forints this year , but a profit of 4 . 0 billion forints is forecast for next year . Szeles said earlier he is interested in buying a stake in Ikarus through Videoton , and the APV official said the agency supports the Hungarian businessman . " The APV really appreciates his efforts at Ikarus , and we will pay for this , " the official said . " He will not get a majority stake in Ikarus , but he likely will get some shares . " The APV , which owns roughly 64 percent of Ikarus , is studying several options for offering a stake in the busmaker to the consortium , and the government expects to reach a decision on a strategy before February , the official said . Hungarian law requires the APV to invite bids for any shares it wants to sell in Ikarus , and the agency will consider all offers , but the consortium with Videoton is likely to be the strongest candidate , the official said . AO AVTOTRAKTOREXPORT or ATEX , a consortium of Russian municipalities and transit authorities that paid $ 50 million for a stake in Ikarus in 1991 , continues to own roughly 31 percent of the busmaker , and it also could sell some of its shares to the Hungarian consortium . - - Ryan Tutak , Budapest newsroom + 36 1 327 4040

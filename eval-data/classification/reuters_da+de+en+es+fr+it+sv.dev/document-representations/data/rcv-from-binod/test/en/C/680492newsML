Roche Vitamins seeks energy savings . Roche Vitamins is investing some $ 38 million to cut energy costs in the expectation of a four to five year payback , Energy Process Engineer Ron Sorensen told Reuters . The investment will enlarge the cogeneration cababilities of the Roche Holding Ltd subsidiary ' s Belvidere , N . J . , plant where the principal vitamin manufactured is ascorbic acid , commonly known as Vitamin C . Production of Vitamin C is an energy intensive process , requiring both electricity and steam which accounts for more than 50 percent of the plant ' s raw material costs , Sorensen told the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities . " Spiraling costs of the late 1970 ' s and early 1980 ' s mandated that we either cut those costs at Belvidere , or Roche would shift production to our other vitamin C plants in Dalry , Scotland , or Grenzach , Germany , " he testified . As a result , in 1983 Belvidere installed a 23 megawatt diesel driven cogeneration plant which covered its on - site electric demand and a significant portion of its steam needs . He said the competitive costs resulted in increased production assignments that have increased Roche ' s on site load 50 percent to 30 megawatts , meaning " we were using the entire output of our cogeneration facility , plus purchasing about seven megawatts of power from ( GPU Inc ) . " Because our old diesel driven cogeneration plant is now undersized to meet our needs , Roche began to investigate a repowering and upgrading of our cogeneration facility as early as 1992 , " Sorensen told the board , which is considering whether an exit fee must be paid when a company stops purchasing power to use a cogeneration plant . He said the new " facility will be a natural gas fired combined cycle unit , resulting in extremely high efficiencies and reducing or NOx , CO and SO2 emissions by 97 percent . Sorensen told Reuters the new plant ' s 40 megawatt capacity is based on Belvidere ' s steam needs . His testimony noted the " project received qualifying facility status in December of 1996 and we filed for all major permits in March 1997 . Contracts for major components which have long delivery dates were placed in January 1997 and construction acturally started in December 1996 . " The cogeneration plant itself will cost $ 34 million , he said in an interview , noting Roche is using General Electric Co turbines because of the company ' s superior service capabilities . When the new system comes on line in June 1998 , Sorensen said , adding the company will then begin paying a monthly stand - by fee of $ 1 per kilowatt hour of peak demand - - $ 30 , 000 per month - - for the ability to purchase power from GPU if Roche has a problem with its cogeneration plant . Because the plant is a " qualifying facility " under federal regulations , he noted , it will be selling 10 megawatts of power to GPU most of the time . Sorensen did not say what impact these sales would have on its stand - by fee . In 1996 and early 1997 , he told the board , " we negotiated for an expanded and improved gas delivery system with ( NUI Corp ' s ) Elizabethtown Gas Co under a proposed contract rate where Roche will be primarily responsible for covering all of Etown ' s reinforcement costs , leaving Etown no economic riskes that the old line will be underutilized , but instead , affording it opportunities to bring natural gas services to an agrea with relatively poor gas infrastructure development . " Roche paid for a 14 mile pipeline with a capacity to move 12 , 000 dekatherms - - 12 billion Btu ' s or roughly 1 . 2 billion cubic feet - - of gas daily directly to its factory from Williams Cos Inc ' s Transco pipeline , Sorensen explained to Reuters . Originally , he said , Roche was going to contract Douglas Oil to operate the pipeline . Instead , it negotiated a new contract with Etown . Sorensen said the company ' s payback on the pipeline portion of its investment will be two years . ( ( - - New York Newsdesk 212 859 - 1610 ) )

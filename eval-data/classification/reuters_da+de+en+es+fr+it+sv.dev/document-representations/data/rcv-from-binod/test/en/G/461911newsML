RUGBY UNION - SOUTH AFRICA UPSET NEW ZEALAND . New Zealand crashed to their first defeat in four years in Hong Kong when they were outclassed 31 - 7 by South Africa in the semifinals of the World Cup Sevens on Sunday . South Africa , who lifted the World Cup 15s title with a win over New Zealand in 1995 , were too quick and committed for a New Zealand side who were missing the powerful Jonah Lomu , Christian Cullen and Waisake Masirewa from last year ' s Hong Kong Sevens winning team . South Africa , with playmaker Joost van der Westhuizen in cracking form , hardly let New Zealand into the game and ran away to a convincing victory . Stephen Brink scored two tries and Andre Venter , Bobby Skinstad and Jacques Olivier also touched down . " It ' s strange to lose after 21 games in Hong Kong without defeat , " said New Zealand coach Gordon Tietjens , who has led the team to three straight wins in the Hong Kong Sevens , an unofficial world championship . " We were beaten by a very committed , talented side who had size , pace and were very skilful . " Fiji beat Western Samoa 38 - 14 in the other semifinal to book their place in the final . Western Samoa took the lead after just a minute when New Zealand referee Paddy O ' Brien awarded a penalty try against Fiji for persistent offside . After conceding their first points of the tournament , Fiji stepped up a gear and the long - striding Marika Vunibaka scored four successive tries .

Iceland , fearing floods , monitors volcano tremors . Iceland , fearing devastating flooding , nervously monitored the tremors from an volcano that erupted dramatically underneath Europe ' s largest glacier . " The longer we have to wait for the flood , the bigger it will be , " said Pall Jonsson , physicist at the hydrological survey at the National Energy Authority . Seismologists at the University of Iceland in the capital of Reykjavik said late on Sunday that the tremors were growing stronger . " There has been a continuous seismic tremor throughout the eruption associated with the flow of molten rock , " said seismologist Ingi Bjarnason , adding that earthquake activity lasting as much as seven minutes at a time had been recorded . Engineers braved driving rain and gale - force winds to try to detect the first signs that vast quantities of water were about to burst from a sub - glacial lake filled to the brim by the eruption . " It ' s like giving birth to a child . You know it ' s coming , but not when , " said Einer Haflidasson , chief engineer for the Icelandic Public Roads Administration . The eruption burst through the remote Vatnajokul glacier in the southeast of the island on Wednesday , creating a dramatic ice fissure 10 km ( 6 miles ) long . The volcano spewed a towering column of ash and steam into the sky and ash began settling in villages in the north and east of the country on Sunday . Scientists were basing their calculations on seismic activity under the huge glacier and thick cloud enveloped the glacier , making it impossible for them to see if the column of dense smoke was growing larger . As the glacial ice rapidly melted in the intense heat of the eruption , radar measurements indicated that water levels in the subglacial Grimsvotn lake had risen a further 10 metres ( 33 feet ) to around 1 , 480 metres ( 4 , 850 feet ) . The increasing pressure implied that the glacier ' s ice cap must eventually be forced off , releasing waters from the sub - glacial lake , parts of the glacier and debris from the eruption in a torrential stream . Scientists estimated that the torrents would reach a maximum speed of between 10 and 25 metres ( yards ) per second . The region is uninhabited but the floods threatened to destroy bridges and the only road running around the whole island , a vital link for those living in Iceland ' s remote east and west . The Vatnajokul glacier stretches over 8 , 300 square km ( 3 , 200 sq miles ) and reaches a depth of a thousand metres ( 3 , 300 feet ) in parts . It is separated from the coast by a fringe of farmland .

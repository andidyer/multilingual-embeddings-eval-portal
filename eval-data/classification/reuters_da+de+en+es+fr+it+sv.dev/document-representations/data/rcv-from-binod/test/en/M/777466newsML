Malaysian curbs pushes ringgit up . Southeast Asian currencies were mostly firmer on Monday after Malaysia announced curbs on currency swap transactions with offshore parties . The ringgit held on to some of its gains after shooting up about 300 points in thin Sydney markets as players moved to cover their short positions . It was quoted at 2 . 6070 / 120 to the dollar at 0415 GMT after hitting a high near 2 . 5800 . It was at 2 . 6370 / 90 late on Friday . Bank Negara Malaysia announced on Sunday that local banks would have to limit non - trade related currency swaps with overseas customers to $ 2 . 0 million , from Monday . The curbs are part of an effort to cool speculation in the ringgit which has dropped more than five percent in the past month to a three - year low of 2 . 6530 . Dealers and analysts said the curbs came as no big surprise after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ' s tirades and hints of action against speculators last week . Some analysts said Malaysia could also impose negative interest rates on deposits placed by foreigners , as in 1994 . The Bank Negara statement said Sunday ' s move was to help control interest rates more effectively . The central bank has been trying to lower interest rates for the past two weeks in an effort to boost domestic economic activity . Some dealers said the ringgit ' s gains would be short - lived and the currency could head back towards its lows around 2 . 65 . " The initial reaction is that people have to get back the ringgit just in case they ' re unable to fund their positions from here , " a Singapore - based dealer said . " But most of the participants have already turned long on the ringgit , which is why they will have room now to attack the ringgit offshore , " he added . In Thailand , the baht received a slight boost from exporter dollar sales and optimism over an economic rescue plan due to be presented to the Thai cabinet on Tuesday . Thailand ' s economic ministers met on Monday to discuss a package of measures worked out between the finance minister and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and a news conference was due around 0500 GMT . The package , which could include a standby credit facility or other aid from the IMF , has made market players more upbeat about Thailand ' s economic outlook . A Singapore dealer said the baht was likely to trade in a range of 31 . 30 - 31 . 80 to the dollar before more details of the plan were announced . The baht was at 31 . 65 / 80 to the dollar onshore at 0415 GMT against 31 . 90 / 32 . 00 late on Friday . It was at 31 . 65 / 75 offshore . The Indonesian rupiah was underpinned by tight money market liquidity but trade was slow , with interest centered on the swap market where players were wary of Indonesia imposing controls similar to those announced by Bank Negara . Spot rupiah was at 2 , 594 / 604 at 0415 GMT against an opening of 2 , 590 / 95 . The Taiwan dollar was firm but shed some of its early strength on continued heavy demand for dollars . Taipei dealers said central bank intervention on Saturday sent a clear signal that a weaker Taiwan dollar was undesirable . It was at T $ 28 . 691 / 698 at 0415 GMT after opening at T $ 2 . 631 against Saturday ' s T $ 28 . 705 close . The Taiwan dollar tumbled more than four percent last week after the central bank abandonned its long - standing defence of the T $ 28 level . The Philippine peso was expected to firm as banks needed to sell dollars to improve their liquidity after the central bank ordered a two - percentage point increase in liquidity reserves to curb speculation last week . One Manila trader said the central bank had sold $ 1 million at 29 pesos in Monday ' s first deal . The peso was at 28 . 950 / 29 . 010 at 0415 GMT against its previous close at 28 . 99 .

Industry growth expanding but not rapidly - - Trebing . Michael Trebing , an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , said on Thursday that regional manufacturing growth remains on track , but no rapid expansion is expected . " I think the best we can say from numbers of these types is that we ' re continuing to see growth in manufacturing in our district , and perhaps over the last two months , we ' ve seen a slight acceleration , " he said . Trebing was speaking to reporters at a conference call after the release of the Philadelphia Fed ' s index of business activity for March . The Philly Fed ' s activity index rose to 21 . 1 in March against a 17 . 4 reading in February . The shipments index jumped to 23 . 9 against 10 . 0 in the previous month . Trebing also said he expects manufacturing activity in the region to continue to growth , but he sees no rapid acceleration . " Growth is expected to continue , but I don ' t see in the numbers an expectation of rapid growth , " Trebing said . The Philadephia Fed economist also said a large increase in employment levels is not expected . He added , however , that the job growth trend was still favorable . " It ' s not a large increase in employment expected , but still a favorable trend , " Trebing said . ( ( - - N . A . Treasury Desk , 212 - 859 - 1676 ) )

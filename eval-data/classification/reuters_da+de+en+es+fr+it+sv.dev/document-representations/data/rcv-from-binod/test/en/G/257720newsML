India Congress party reiterates Deve Gowda support . The president of India ' s Congress party , which gives vital backing to Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda ' s coalition , was quoted on Sunday as saying there was no move to withdraw his support . " We will reconsider extending support to the United Front government only when it does something which totally goes against the ideology of the Congress , and there is a conflict , " Sitaram Kesri told the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) . " It is too early to say such a conflict has arisen , " Kesri was quoted as saying in an interview . But Kesri ruled out joining the six - month - old government . " We will lose our identity if we join the government , " PTI quoted him as saying . The Congress controls 142 votes in the 545 - seat parliament . It offered support to the 13 - party United Front coalition to keep from power the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , which along with its allies has 195 seats . The BJP , with a few more seats than the United Front , formed a government in June . But it resigned after 12 days in power as the United Front and the Congress joined ranks against what they said was its bias against India ' s minority Moslems . Former prime minister P . V . Narasimha Rao resigned as head of Congress in September after receiving a court summons in a case of cheating . Kesri then took over leadership of the party , which has ruled India for all but four years since independence from Britain in 1947 . Though Congress suffered its worst defeat at general polls this year it was confident of regaining power , Kesri said . " If anyone feels that one - party rule cannot come back at the centre , he is totally off the mark and he is underestimating the Congress party , " Kesri said . Critics have accused the Congress party of not doing enough to check corruption in its ranks and alienating its traditional supporters among low caste Hindus and minority Moslems . Congress was set to gain one more lawmaker in parliament on Sunday when a breakaway regional group , the Karnataka Congress Party ( KCP ) , merged into the party . Kesri attended a function in southern Bangalore city to mark the merger of the group led by S . Bangarappa , former chief minister of Karnataka , who has a parliamentary seat , PTI said . At least three breakaway groups of the Congress , led by dissidents who differed with Rao ' s leadership , have responded to Kesri ' s call to rejoin the party from which they broke away .

Bhutto denies Pakistan interfering in Afghan war . Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto denied on Tuesday Afghan government charges that Pakistan was meddling in Afghanistan ' s long - running civil war and urged all factions to stop fighting and talk . " We were very disturbed to hear the accusations from the Kabul government , " she told Reuters in an interview . " We were concerned because we had spent many long and arduous months building bridges to the Kabul regime and recently things had seemed to brighten up . " Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani ' s spokesman urged Pakistan on Monday to " recall its militias " from Afghanistan , a reference to the rebel Islamic Taleban movement , which captured the eastern city of Jalalabad last Wednesday . " Really we are not involved in internal Afghan developments , " Bhutto said . " We would like to show the Kabul government and all the other groups that we do not wish to interfere and we have nothing to gain from interfering . " We seek friendship with all Afghan people wherever they may reside . . . and I would like to take this opportunity to urge an intra - Afghan dialogue and an end to the fighting , " she said . Pakistan froze contacts with the Rabbani government after a mob sacked its embassy in Kabul a year ago in protest at alleged Pakistani backing for the Taleban religious militants . Relations improved recently when Pakistan agreed to reopen its Kabul mission in temporary premises and sold substantial quantities of food to the Afghan government , though the Taleban seizure of Jalalabad has prevented its delivery by road . Bhutto said her government backed United Nations peace efforts , which she said needed full Western support . " The United Nations on its own will not be in a position to exercise the same kind of influence , " she said , citing the role of the United States in brokering the Dayton accords for Bosnia . " I think it ' s important to have a U . N . - backed solution , but more important is the political support the West is prepared to give the United Nations in seeking a solution , " Bhutto said . She said some Western and Moslem countries had grown frustrated with attempts to reach an Afghan settlement and frequent violations of solemnly sworn accords . " It ' s important not to be frustrated but to press again for a political solution , " Bhutto said , adding that it was vital to prevent bloodshed that a Taleban assault on Kabul might cause . The Taleban , who have besieged the Afghan capital for the past year from the south and southeast , are widely expected to make a fresh attempt to capture the city , depose Rabbani and install a strict Islamic order throughout Afghanistan .

Rights group urges Gore to cancel China trip . Human Rights Watch / Asia on Wednesday urged Vice President Al Gore to suspend plans to visit China this spring in light of what it called " the deteriorating human rights situation there . " " For the vice president to proceed with plans for a late March or April visit would send a signal that the Chinese authorities can step up arrests , impose harsh sentences for peaceful dissent , curtail civil liberties in Hong Kong and muzzle human rights criticism . . . . without fear of international criticism , " the group said in a new report . Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is due to visit Washington next month and the dates of Gore ' s trip would likely be announced then , the group said . Gore ' s visit would be seen as the precursor of a formal exchange of state visits between President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin . The group said Gore ' s visit should be postponed until China made visible progress on human rights , including the release of " arbitrarily detained prisoners " such as bankers and business leaders , increased access to Tibet , access by humanitarian groups to Chinese prisons and access by international observers to political trials . " A visit by Vice President Gore at this time will inevitably be interpreted by the Chinese government as another signal of U . S . indifference to its human rights practices , " the report said . Secretary of State Warren Christopher pressed China to make human rights improvements when he visited the country last November . China has instead stepped up arrests and trials , Human Rights Watch / Asia said , citing thousands of summary arrests and thousands of executions . In addition , it said China was moving quickly to begin exerting control over Hong Kong , due to revert to Chinese control July 1 .

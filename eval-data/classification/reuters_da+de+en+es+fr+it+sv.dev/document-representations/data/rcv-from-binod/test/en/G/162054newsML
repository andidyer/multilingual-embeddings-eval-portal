CRICKET - BOLAND AND GRIQUAS SHARE SECOND DAY ' S PLAY . Boland and Griqualand West sharedthe spoils after the second day of their four - day SupersportSeries cricket match at Boland Bank Park on Saturday . Bowled out for 268 in their first innings , Boland restrictedtheir visitors to 249 for nine at stumps . After struggling to remove the Griquas openers , the Bolandattack , often guilty of bowling both sides of the wicket , rallied by picking up wickets at crucial stages . Griquas openers Mickey Arthur ( 31 ) and Martyn Gidley ( 39 ) made a solid start before Arthur was given out leg before wicketby umpire Cyril Mitchley . Thereafter , Griquas rarely looked comfortable as slowleft - armer Claude Henderson and seamer Roger Telemachusmaintained a tidy line which strangled the Griqua reply . Henderson proved to be the pick of the Boland attack , collecting 3 - 69 off 34 overs , but the supporting roles ofTelemachus and , to a lesser degree , Henry Williams and DavidMillns also kept Griquas in check . The Griqua reply was built around a workmanlike 64 fromPieter Barnard who hit seven fours in his stay of one and a halfhours at the crease while Finley Brooker ( 34 ) and Cedric English ( 27 ) also chipped in with valuable contributions .

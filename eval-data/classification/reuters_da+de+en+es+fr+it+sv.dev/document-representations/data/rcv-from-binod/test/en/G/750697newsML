French firefighters douse Paris museum blaze . A potentially disastrous blaze at one of the French capital ' s most popular tourist attractions damaged works in an architecture museum but spared 30 , 000 films stored in the nation ' s premier film library , officials said on Wednesday . Two firefighters were slightly injured overnight as they struggled to contain the flames on the roof of a wing of the Palais de Chaillot , facing the Eiffel Tower from Trocadero Square , which houses the Museum of French Monuments and the Cinematheque film library . " It ' s much less catastrophic than we thought , " Nathalie Bondil , a museum curator , told reporters after the fire was finally doused in early morning . She said about 100 casts of Gothic art had been damaged , but none had been destroyed . What damage there was had been caused by the water used by firemen to extinguish the flames . All 30 , 000 films in the Cinematheque library were rescued intact , another official said . But the film museum , situated in a basement and partly flooded , may have suffered , he said . Costumes , posters , drawings , and models tracking the origins of cinema are on display there . Props include the skeletal frame of Mrs Bates from the horror movie " Psycho " . Initial evidence pointed to an accidental blaze , police said . The fire broke out in an area of the roof that was being renovated . " The investigation is under way . Apparently there was soldering work being carried out during the day , " Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann told reporters . " It seems the fire smouldered for several hours , which explains its scale , " she said . The Museum of French Monuments includes plans or models of some of France ' s most famous buildings , including the great cathedrals of Notre - Dame and Chartres , in a history of the nation ' s architecture . " The frame of the roof window caught fire and that made the glass explode . The frame fell on the museum collections . . . mouldings , plasterwork , " the director of the Palais de Chaillot told Europe 1 radio .

Turkish foray cuts value of Iraqi dinar - paper . The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq and a cut in food rations this month sent Iraq ' s dinar currency plummeting against the U . S . dollar , a newly published Baghdad newspaper said on Thursday . Al - Zawra , whose first edition appeared on Thursday , said the dinar fell to 1 , 480 to the dollar from 1 , 200 in May when Turkish troops stormed northern Iraq in pursuit of guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party . The dinar , it said , declined further when the trade ministry announced late last month a cut of more than 50 percent in certain food items in the ration card . Zawra , published by Iraq ' s journalists union , said the dinar had lost about one third of its value since the start of the Turkish foray into northern Iraq on May 14 . It said it was now trading at more than 1 , 500 to the dollar . The paper included interviews with anonymous traders who predicted a further fall in the local currency if the presence of Turkish troops in northern Iraq continued for a longer period . State - run newspapers have stopped publishing articles on the state of the economy , particularly the dinars ups and downs against the greenback . Zawra ' s article appeared in the front page where it also published a picture of President Saddam Hussein and his eldest son Uday . Uday , who left hospital on Tuesday after the assassination attempt on his life six months ago , is chairman of Iraq ' s journalists union . The rise in the dollar usually boomerangs on prices of essential commodities in Iraq . The government is pressing ahead with its strict monetary policies , printing dinars only to finance projects of national interest . Iraq ' s dinar , on a roller - coaster ride since sanctions were imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 , had at one point slumped to about 3 , 000 to the dollar . It started its downward trend when the government squeezed expenditures and ordered ministries to find their own ways of financing by selling vehicles and property and asking for an economic price for their services . The dinar surged to about 400 to the dollar last year on Iraq ' s resumption of partial oil exports . Traders told Zawra the volatile dinar was prone even to smallest events happening in the region . " Any event taking place in the region and affecting its stability no matter how small will inevitably have an impact on the market situation , " one trader said .

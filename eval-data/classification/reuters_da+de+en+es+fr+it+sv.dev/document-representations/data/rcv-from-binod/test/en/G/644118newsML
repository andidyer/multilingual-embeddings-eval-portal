France says Algerians demonstrate desire for peace . France said on Friday Algeria ' s election campaign had shown a longing for peace after five years of bloodshed , but said it would await the verdict of foreign observers before commenting on the result . Algeria ' s Interior Ministry said the pro - presidential National Democratic Party won 155 of 380 seats in parliament , ahead of the Islam - oriented Movement of a Peaceful Society ( MPS ) on 69 seats . The MPS complained of vote irregularities . " The election campaign reveals that the Algerian people have shown their desire for peace , for a political solution to overcome the crisis and , finally , to end the violence , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said . He said France was awaiting both confirmation of Thursday ' s result from Algeria ' s constitutional council and " the conclusions of international observers " before commenting on the result . Algeria won independence from France in 1962 . The election excluded the banned fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) , which had been poised to win a 1992 election abruptly cancelled by the military authorities . Since then , an estimated 60 , 000 people have died in fighting .

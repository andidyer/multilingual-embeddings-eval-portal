Rebels cut key east Zaire highway - - aid workers . Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels battling the Zairean army have cut a section of the highway between the eastern Zaire provincial towns of Bukavu and Uvira , aid workers said on Sunday . " The Banyamulenge rebels have taken up positions on both sides of the highway - - both up on the hills and on the plain - - so at the moment the road is impassable , " one aid worker said . " It is very difficult to get precise information at the moment . The only people who are able to circulate freely are the soldiers or the fighters , " said the aid worker based in Bukavu , which is about 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Uvira . Tension in Bukavu rose dramatically following reports of intensifying fightging , residents said . A United Nations envoy was due to arrive in Bukavu on Sunday to assess how to contain the ethnic conflict in eastern Zaire , which could draw in the armies of neighbouring Burundi and Rwanda , both dominated by Tutsis . Aid workers in Uvira said earlier many people had been killed and wounded in renewed fighting between the Zairean military and Banyamulenge rebels . Fighting took place at Bwegora , between the Lubarizi and Luvungi refugee camps 25 km ( 16 miles ) north of Uvira , they said by telephone from Uvira to the Burundi capital Bujumbura . " There was heavy firing by automatic and light arms and mortars , leaving many dead and wounded , " a senior aid worker told Reuters . He was unable to give precise casualty figures . A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross which had established an emergency hospital in Uvira had left for the area , the aid worker said .

China says no date on farm import tariff quotas . China is considering setting limits on imports of some farm products , including soybeans and soybean oil , but a date has yet to be fixed , officials said on Wednesday . " Departments concerned are still discussing how to implement the tariff quota system , " an official of the tariff committee of the State Economic and Trade Commission said . " It is difficult to say when it will go into effect , " she said without giving further details . China said last year that tariff quotas would apply to imports of some farm goods including wheat , corn , rice , soybeans and soybean oil from April 1996 , but has delayed the introduction of the system . The government has published tariff rates linked to the new tariff quotas but has not announced the quota on each item . Officials have said the move aims to protect local production and bring China closer to international practices . However , traders and operators of joint ventures say the quota system is restrictive , encourages smuggling and is a disincentive for foreigners to participate in the Chinese market . Traders attending an international conference in Beijing on China ' s vegetable oils , fats and feed ingredients industries said a quota is usually issued only to large domestic companies , leaving joint ventures out in the cold . They point to vegetable oil import licences , which are currently issued to just a handful of state - owned importers . " What they are trying to do is to limit imports to protect the local crushing industry and the local farmers , " said one trader at the conference , organised by Singapore ' s Centre for Management Technology . " If you want to encourage joint ventures but you have a quota system and you don ' t give quota to these ventures , how will they survive ? " he asked . " They will leave . " China ' s vegetable oil refining industry currently faced overcapacity , another trader said , " but quotas are restricting people from coming in freely to buy " . The United Soybean Board , a U . S . lobby group funded by soybean growers , has said China should do away with its quota system and allow the market to rule . The group is a supporter of China ' s bid to join the World Trade Organisation and the extension by Washington of Beijing ' s most - favoured nation trade status . Soybean imports are currently subject to a three - percent import duty , but require no import license , an official of the China National Cereals , Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp ( COFCO ) said . " There are no restrictions on imports of soybeans , " he told Reuters by telephone . But he said there are plans to introduce tariff quotas on soybeans , limiting the amount that can be imported at three percent duty . Imports outside the quota will be subject to a 114 percent tariff . China sets a 13 percent tariff rate on soybean oil imports and requires import permits , the COFCO official said . China plans to set quota on soybean oil imports , imports within quota will be subjected to 13 percent and imports outside the quota will be 121 . 6 percent , he said . - - Beijing Newsroom ( 8610 ) 6532 - 1921

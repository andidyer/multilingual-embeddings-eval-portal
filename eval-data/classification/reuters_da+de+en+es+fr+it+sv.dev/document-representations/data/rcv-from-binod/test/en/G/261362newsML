Spielberg was anonymous buyer of Gable ' s Oscar . Filmmaker Steven Spielberg anonymously purchased Clark Gable ' s 1934 Oscar for a record $ 550 , 000 at a weekend auction and then donated it on Tuesday to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . The academy , which hands out Hollywood ' s annual Oscars , had fought unsuccessfully to bar Sunday ' s auction of the 12 - inch ( 30 - cm ) gold - plated statuette that Gable won for his role in the movie " It Happened One Night . " " Bless Steven Spielberg , " an emotional academy president Arthur Hiller told reporters . He said officials of the academy , which had argued the Oscars were never meant as articles of trade , had no advance knowledge of Spielberg ' s plans and were " still reeling from the breathtaking generosity of Steven ' s action . " " The man has a hell of a way with a holiday gift , " Hiller added . In a letter to the academy after the auction , the Oscar - winning director wrote : " If not with the Clark Gable estate , I could think of no better sanctuary for Gable ' s only Oscar than the motion picture academy . " The Oscar statuette is the most personal recognition of good work our industry can ever bestow , and it strikes me as a sad sign of our times that this icon could be confused with a commercial treasure , " he said . Spielberg was also the anonymous bidder who bought Gable ' s personal script for the 1939 film classic " Gone With the Wind " for $ 220 , 000 Sunday at Christie ' s Los Angeles auction house . But there were no plans for Spielberg to donate the script to the academy along with the Oscar , academy officials said . Both were sold by Gable ' s estate . Spielberg , the world ' s most commercially successful filmmaker who directed such blockbusters as " E . T . " and " Jurassic Park , " won Oscars for best picture and best director in 1994 for his Holocaust epic " Schindler ' s List . " Heaping praise on Spielberg , Hiller said : " Steven not only epitomises filmmaking , he really epitomises caring . Lots of people care , but Steven does something about it . " The identity of the buyer of Gable ' s Oscar was shrouded in mystery on Sunday when the winning bid was made by telephone during an auction of Hollwyood artifacts and memorabilia . The bid of $ 550 , 000 topped the previous record price for an Oscar of $ 510 , 000 , set in 1993 at Sotheby ' s auction house for the statuette given to Vivien Leigh when she was named best actress for her role opposite Gable in " Gone With the Wind . " Hiller said academy officials were contacted on Sunday by Spielberg ' s office and were told that he wanted to donate the Oscar to the academy . It was turned over on Tuesday and Hiller said it would be placed on permanent display at the academy ' s Centre for Motion Picture Study in Beverly Hills . Last Friday , the academy had asked a Los Angeles judge to block the sale of Gable ' s Oscar . But the judge refused and the auction went ahead as planned . Including auction fees , which are paid by the buyer , Gable ' s Oscar fetched $ 607 , 500 , and the script went for a total of $ 244 , 500 . Gable , who died in 1960 at the age of 59 , won the Oscar for his role as a wisecracking newspaper reporter in love with a runaway heiress , played by Claudette Colbert . " It Happened One Night " swept the Academy Awards , with Colbert , director Frank Capra and the film itself also being honoured .

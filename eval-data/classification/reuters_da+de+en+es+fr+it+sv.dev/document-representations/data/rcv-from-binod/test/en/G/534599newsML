MOTOR RACING - SCHUMACHER BELIEVES FERRARI CAN BEAT WILLIAMS . [ CORRECTED 10 : 10 GMT ] Twice world champion Michael Schumacher believes he can score Ferarri ' s first win since last September at Sunday ' s San Marino Grand Prix on a track which puts a premium on power and pit - stop strategy . Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams won both the Grand Prix in Brazil and Argentina . ( Corrects to delete reference to opening Grand Prix ) " I am confident we can finish on the podium at the next race , " said Schumacher . " We should be much better suited to the characteristics of the Imola circuit . But it is going to be tough to win . " The Williams looks like the best car so far and it is difficult to beat , so it will not be easy for us . But I do think that if we have a bit of luck and everything goes well for us we have a chance . " German Schumacher , the world champion in 1994 and 1995 , predicted also that his own lap record at the 4 . 895 - kms track - - set when he grabbed a dramatic pole position for Ferrari last year - - will be shattered . " We can expect to see that record quite comprehensively beaten , " he said . " It will be the same as on the other circuits we have been to so far . This is because of the softer tyres everyone is now running caused by the tyre competition between Goodyear and Bridgestone . " While Schumacher hinted that he may be ready to challenge for his first win of the season , championship leader Villeneuve made it clear that he has no intention of releasing his early - season grip on the drivers ' title race . " I did not have a good race at Imola last year , " he said . " So I am looking forward to doing a lot better this time . To be honest , I just cannot wait to get there and to get on with it because I feel the season has started pretty well for me . " The pace has been increasing a lot and we have stayed with it and I think there should be some pretty good racing . " After his Latin American wins , Villeneuve holds a comfortable lead in the drivers ' championship , but his Williams ' team mate German Heinz - Harald Frentzen has struggled to match him and is still without a point after three races since being introduced as the team ' s replacement for world champion Damon HIll of Britain . " Since I came back from Argentina , I have been testing in Barcelona and getting some more important kilometres under my belt , " Frentzen said . " For me , the season starts again in Europe at Imola , on a circuit which is very quick and which also has a good variety of corners . I will do all I can to open my points account . " Schumacher won the 1994 race , restarted following Brazilian Ayton Senna ' s fatal accident , but in the two years since Hill won each time for Williams and a further victory by Villeneuve would complete a hat - trick for him this year and by the team at Imola .

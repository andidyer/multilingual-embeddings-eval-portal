Polaris unveils Victory cruiser motorcycle . Polaris Industries Inc . roared into the motorcycle business Thursday by unveiling the Victory V92C , priced between $ 10 , 000 and $ 15 , 000 and aimed right at the Harley - style heavy cruiser crowd . Stretching nearly eight feet long and weighing 600 pounds , the Victory generates 75 horsepower from its 1 , 507 - cc oil - cooled engine - - the largest V - twin powerplant available . The burly machine is the first motorcycle to be mass produced by an all - new U . S . builder in 40 years and marks a daring step for Minneapolis - based Polaris , the world ' s largest maker of snowmobiles . Polaris took care at an unveiling ceremony here to avoid seeming to issue a direct challenge to the legendary Harley - Davidson Inc . , of nearby Milwaukee , Wis . " Our marketing focus is not to go after Harley - Davidson , " said Matt Parks , general manager of the Victory line . " The biggest competitors would be the Japanese , followed by the Europeans and then Harley - Davidson , " Parks said . Pre - production Victory bikes will be available late next month for testing and display , and limited quantities for public sale are scheduled to hit showrooms next spring . Early distribution will be through 200 of Polaris ' 2 , 000 dealers . " Our plan is to sell to our dedicated Polaris customers the first couple of years , " Parks said . About 30 percent of present owners of Polaris snowmobiles , all - terrain vehicles and personal watercraft already own a motorcycle as well , the company estimated . Loyal Polaris customers are expected to furnish enough demand to buy out the first two years ' production of the Victory , Parks said . The Victory is expected to make a hard run at Harley copycat manufacturers such as Honda Motor Co . Ltd , Yamaha Motor Co . Ltd , Suzuki Motor Corp . and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd . Japanese motorcycle makers have been profiting for years by selling heavy cruiser motorcycles to people unwilling to sit on a lengthy waiting list to get a genuine Harley , industry analysts said . The Victory ' s engine will be built in Osceola , Wis . , with final manufacturing done in Spirit Lake , Iowa . Polaris said it expects to break even on its $ 20 million investment three years after market introduction .

Key Singapore opposition figure loses parliament bid . Prominent Singapore opposition leader Chee Soon Juan was soundly defeated on Thursday in his bid for a seat in parliament . Chee , leader of the Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP ) , had conceded defeat ahead of an official announcement showing him taking just a third of the vote in the MacPherson constituency , after being branded a " proven liar " by the ruling People ' s Action Party . " Tell our supporters we have to be gracious in defeat , " Chee told reporters after coming out of the counting centre . He said he would take a few weeks off to think over his future , while supporters on the scene pleaded with him to stay in politics . Returns from four other single - member districts showed the People ' s Action Party ( PAP ) taking all three , including one that had been held by a fellow member of Chee ' s SDP . Returns from 31 other seats up for grabs in Thursday ' s election were to be announced later . The PAP had already taken 47 seats in the 83 - member parliament on Nomination Day December 23 , when the opposition failed to contest them .

NATO prevents violence between rival Serb police . NATO sent in British troops to prevent a possible clash between rival police forces in Bosnia ' s Serb territory as a power struggle among Serb leaders intensified . British soldiers in Spartan armoured vehicles and two platoons of Royal Military Police stood guard outside a police station early on Monday morning after it was seized by special police units loyal to Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic . Some 50 special policemen entered the building before dawn on Sunday because they said hardliners opposed to Plavsic were using the station to tap the president ' s telephones and faxes . Hardline nationalists later asked for permission to send in their own special police to counter the action but the NATO - led peace Stabilisation Force ( SFOR ) denied the request . SFOR then ordered British troops in to defuse tensions and international police monitors launched an investigation into charges that rival police had mounted electronic surveillance of Plavsic ' s office . SFOR spokesman Lieutenant - Colonel Mike Wright said that Plavsic ' s police eventually agreed to withdraw from the building under the protection of British troops . " At the moment we ' re in the process of moving 24 of them out , " Wright said before midnight ( 2200 GMT ) . " We are taking them by tracked vehicle to their headquarters about 12 km ( 8 miles ) north of Banja Luka . " The police who normally occupy the building stood outside watching the withdrawal of their rivals . " We are taking responsibility for getting the special police out of the building . There is no possibility of any clash , " Wright added . SFOR said the action by Plavsic ' s forces violated new guidelines for special police handed down by NATO this month . The police action reflected mounting tensions in Bosnia ' s Serb territory where Plavsic supporters are waging a battle for power against loyalists of ex - president and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic . Western officials say Plavsic has been aware for some time that her office was under surveillance from her rivals . Her police conducted a sudden search of the main hotel in Banja Luka last month looking for bugging devices . Dragan Lukac , a senior police officer allied with Plavsic , said evidence was found on Sunday that showed secret police loyal to Karadzic had " continuously tapped " the president ' s telephone conversations , Serb media reported . NATO has set down new rules for special police in Bosnia as part of an attempt to crack down on units which underpin Karadzic ' s rule . But it was police loyal to Plavsic who ended up violating the guidelines first . Western governments have thrown their weight behind Plavsic because they say she has shown willingness to abide by the country ' s peace agreement . In addition to Plavsic , state security allegedly tapped the phones of constitutional court judges Rajko Kuzmanovic and Jovo Rosic , Lukac told a Banja Luka radio station . One of the judges , Rosic , was badly beaten last Thursday because he opposed plans for the court to strike down a decision by Plavsic to dissolve parliament and call early elections , independent Serb media reported . With Rosic absent from the seven - member court , the remaining judges declared Plavsic ' s move unconstitutional last Friday but gave no explanation for the ruling . Karadzic ' s allies had pushed through the court decision in a bid to gain the upper hand in their conflict with Plavsic .

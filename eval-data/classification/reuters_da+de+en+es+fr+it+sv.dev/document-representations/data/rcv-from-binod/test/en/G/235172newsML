Groups seek order in affirmative action case . A coalition of civil rights groups asked for a court order Tuesday to stop the University of California from implementing an anti - affirmative action measure passed by the state ' s voters . The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) said it and other civil rights groups asked U . S . District Judge Thelton Henderson to issue a temporary restraining order to stop the giant university from putting into effect the controversial measure approved by Californians in the Nov . 5 election . The ACLU said a court hearing on whether to grant the order was set for Thursday in San Francisco . The measure , Proposition 209 , bars discrimination and preferential treatment based on race or sex in public employment , education and contracting in California , effectively outlawing government affirmative action programs used to broaden opportunities for women and minorities . The civil rights groups sued to block Proposition 209 and Henderson issued a temporary restraining order last week barring California Gov . Pete Wilson and Attorney General Dan Lungren from implementing the measure . He said there was a " strong probability " that it would be found unconstitutional . Henderson ' s order remains in effect at least until Dec . 16 , when the judge will hear the civil rights groups ' arguments for a preliminary injunction that would freeze Proposition 209 until a trial can be held on the measure ' s constitutionality . According to the ACLU , University of California representatives indicated the university planned to continue implementing Proposition 209 despite Henderson ' s ruling . The passage of Proposition 209 had an immediate impact on the nine - campus University of California , which ordered that race and sex be dropped immediately as factors in deciding which students won places at the university . The University of California , which has more than 160 , 000 students , is due to begin making decisions soon on undergraduate admissions for the fall of 1997 . ACLU officials said they were concerned the university might take decisions on undergraduate admissions and financial aid which would be affected by Proposition 209 before Dec . 16 . A spokesman for the University of California was not immediately available for comment .

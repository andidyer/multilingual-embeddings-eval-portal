Immunex says FDA approves Leukine liquid . Immunex Corp said the U . S . Food and Drug Administration approved a new liquid , multiple - dose formulation of Leukine , which stimulates the immune system and helps prevent infection in certain cancer patients . The drug has been available in the U . S . since 1991 , in a dehydrated concentrate formulation . The company said the new formulation is expected to broaden the drug ' s marketability and consumer appeal . A preservative included in the new formulation insures sterility and allows for multiple doses to be taken with a needle from the same vial . While the drug currently is not sold for at - home use , Immunex said the new formulation makes that more feasible , and added that the multiple - dosing possibilities reduce waste and cost . Leukine is given to older adult leukemia patients to treat neutropenia , a depletion of a certain class of white blood cells .

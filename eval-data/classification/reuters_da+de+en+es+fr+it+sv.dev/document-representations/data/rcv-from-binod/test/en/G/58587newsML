Clinton urges voters to " stay the course " . On the stump in a key Midwestern battleground state , President Bill Clinton on Tuesday urged voters to " stay the course " and pledged to improve education and efforts to fight crime in a second term . In a visit to this Detroit suburb , Clinton preached an optimistic message , saying his policies had led to an economic boom as well as improvements in some of America ' s pressing social problems such as crime , a subject Republican Bob Dole is attacking Clinton on this week . " I don ' t want to declare victory over crime . I just say we ' re heading in the right direction , " he said . " We can do that if you will stay the course . " Clinton also pledged to continue his efforts to build what he called " the finest education system available to all Americans of all ages . " " The 21st century will give more people more chances to live out their dreams than any period in human history , " Clinton told a noisy throng of several thousand on the athletic field at John Glenn High School , named for the Ohio senator who was the first U . S . astronaut to circle the globe . Before he spoke , he went on a tour of the William D . Ford Vocational and Technical Centre , which provides training in 22 programmes ranging from auto body repair to printing technology . Clinton was attempting to solidify his already large lead over Dole in Michigan , one of several states in the Midwest , including Ohio , Illinois and Wisconsin , that may hold the key to a race most experts predict will tighten before Nov . 5 . Clinton ' s campaign received a blow earlier in Washington when the commission planning for the 1996 presidential debates recommended that Reform Party candidate Ross Perot and all other third - party candidates be excluded . Asked by reporters if he would accept the recommendation , Clinton said he would leave the matter up to his debate negotiators , but he added : " I enjoyed having him ( Perot ) in there in ' 92 . I thought he made a valuable contribution . " Asked whether he was afraid to debate Dole one - on - one , Clinton said : " I ' m not afraid of any debate . " Clinton ' s camp would have preferred that Perot be allowed to participate since he would seem more likely to draw voters from Dole rather than the incumbent Democrat . Today ' s decision was met with regret by Clinton ' s lead debate negotiator Mickey Kantor . White House officials insisted Perot had a right to be included , particularly since his campaign qualified and received $ 29 . 2 million in federal money for the fall campaign . " We ' d like to see him in there , " one official said . " He ' s on the ballot in every state . We gave him federal money . " But the decision did not dampen the enthusiasm of the president ' s high - flying campaign , basking in the glow of a lead in public opinion polls that has so far survived all of Dole ' s attempts to dampen it . Clinton was on the first day of a four - day cross - country swing that was to take him to Chicago for the rest of the day , then to Arizona , Washington and Oregon the rest of the week . As evidence of his campaign ' s confidence it has solidified the Democratic base , Clinton ' s visit to Arizona on Wednesday for an environmental event at the Grand Canyon will be his second stop in the traditionally Republican state in a week . Before leaving Washington , he announced new ways to help workers protect their pension plans when they change jobs . The initiative aims to make it easier for workers to " roll over " their pension plans when they move to a new company or to keep their investment options if they choose to leave their money in their old company ' s retirement plan . " At a time when we are trying to seize the opportunities of a growing economy , when five million workers with pensions change jobs every year , we have to make it easier for them to save , " Clinton said in a brief Oval Office ceremony . " Today we are saying to the five millon people who change jobs every year . . . you ' ve got a lot better chance to take your retirement plan with you and that means more security for American families , " he added . The proposals , which were outlined by the White House last April , were the latest in a string of relatively modest federal initiatives that Clinton has put forward .

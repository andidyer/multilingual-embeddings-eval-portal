UK blocks London Clubs bid for Capital . The UK Department of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday it was blocking the planned acquisition by London Clubs International Plc of fellow casino operator Capital Corp Plc . Trade and industry secretary Margaret Beckett said in a statement , " I accept the MMC ' s ( Monopolies and Mergers Commission ) conclusion that the merger of LCI and Capital may be expected to operate against the public interest . " Beckett said that the MMC identified a number of adverse affects which could be expected to arise if the merger were to proceed . The MMC report concluded that the removal of Capital would substantially reduce customers ' choice of casino operator and said that the level of innovation undertaken would suffer . It also said that barriers to entry into the casino market would be raised even further . London Clubs , which operates seven casinos in London , had been awaiting news of its hostile 190 million stg bid for Capital since the bid was referred to the MMC in April . A merged company would have had control of almost two - thirds of London ' s 1 . 7 billion stg casino market - - an increasingly attractive sector as rules on membership and drinking loosen in Britain . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 4019

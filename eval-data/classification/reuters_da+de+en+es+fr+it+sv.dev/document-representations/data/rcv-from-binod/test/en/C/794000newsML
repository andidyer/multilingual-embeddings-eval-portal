United Utilities ' s Pitcher hangs on . Sir Desmond Pitcher , the controversial chairman of Britain ' s water and electricity giant United Utilities , on Tuesday headed off calls for his immediate resignation - - at least until autumn . After a two - hour board meeting following personality clashes between Pitcher and other directors , United said only it was aware of the succession issue and was " taking immediate action to resolve the position " . But the company left a boardroom row unresolved , stating that it would make no further statement until " the autumn " . Speculation that Pitcher - - dubbed " King Des " by his critics for what they call his autocratic management style - - might be forced to give up his executive duties or even quit the board has intensified since the surprise sacking last month of chief executive Brian Staples . Pitcher , one of the best - paid utility executives in Britain , is due to retire in 2000 along with chief executive Derek Green . Green was promoted last month . A company spokesman said cryptically that the company needed to resolve the retirement issue to ensure it " does not present any problems to the company " . " You wouldn ' t want the chairman and chief executive leaving on the same day as two new ones started . . . I wouldn ' t want to expand any further , " he said . Peter Middleton , a non - executive director and chairman of Barclays investment banking unit BZW , has been canvassing institutional shareholder opinion amid increasing concern at the management structure of the company and Pitcher ' s leadership style . Shareholders , outraged at the way Staples was ousted , want the board to restore credibility and settle the succession issue as swiftly as possible . Staples was sacked while on holiday last month , becoming the second chief executive to be shown the door in the last four years . The move sent United ' s shares tumbling from 770 pence . They ended three pence weaker at 708p on Tuesday . United Utilities was formed in 1995 after Pitcher , as chairman of North West Water , launched and won an auction battle against two U . S . utilities for control the region ' s local regional electricity company Norweb .

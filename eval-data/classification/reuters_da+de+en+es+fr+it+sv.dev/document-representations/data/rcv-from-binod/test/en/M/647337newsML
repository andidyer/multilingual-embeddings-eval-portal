OLO seen in range , investors await higher yields . Belgian linear bond futures ended firmer but off early highs on Monday , as the prospect of new volume at Tuesday ' s exchange auction weighed on the market . Linear bonds were seen in tight ranges as the market outlook remained fuzzy , with no clear trend in sight . Dealers said that investors remained sidelined , waiting for yields to rise back to six percent . " But when they hit six percent , they will wait for 6 . 25 , " one dealer said . The 2007 OLO closed with a yield of 5 . 88 percent ( from 5 . 88 Friday ) BE286 = , nine bps over Bunds ( 8 ) MEUR . On Tuesday , the Treasury is offering OLO lines 27 ( 4 . 00 pct , Jan 2000 ) , 10 ( 8 . 75 pct , June 2002 ) , 20 ( 7 . 75 pct , Oct 2004 ) and 26 ( 6 . 25 pct March 2007 ) against OLO 8 ( 9 . 25 pct , Aug 1997 ) and 4 ( 9 . 25 pct , Jan 98 ) . Many dealers expect the Treasury to continue its policy of relatively low allocation , favouring T - bill auctions instead . Short - term yields edged up slightly ahead of the weekly T - bill auction as the franc suffered some spill - over pressure from the French franc . - - Geert De Clercq , Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6813 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

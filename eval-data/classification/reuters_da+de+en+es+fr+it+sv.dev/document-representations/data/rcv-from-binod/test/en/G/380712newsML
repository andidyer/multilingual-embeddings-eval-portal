Cambodian king warns Khmer Rouge gaining power . King Norodom Sihanouk has warned that Cambodias accommodating policy toward defecting Khmer Rouge guerrillas has led to a dangerous rebirth of the movement at a time when the rebels should be at their weakest . " The dying Khmer Rouge have been saved from a certain death , " Sihanouk said in a written interview with his cabinet ' s monthly bulletin released on Saturday . The Khmer Rouge , architects of the brutal 1975 - 1979 " killing fields " regime , have been decimated in recent months by waves of defections . Less than 2 , 000 hardliners are thought to remain . But while the Maoist guerrillas have lost military might , they have managed to gain political leverage as feuding co - Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen compete to win control over defectors and the loyalty of dissident leader Ieng Sarys Democratic National United Movement . " The irony of all of this is that our famous Leaders have decided to open their arms to the Khmer Rouge at the same moment that they ( the Khmer Rouge ) were already out of breath and at the end of the road , their troops having been abandoned by their people . . . and already convinced of their inevitable death very soon , " Sihanouk said . " They have been brought back to life with fanfare and have been given certificates of patriotism and even of heroes , " he added . Sihanouk said the demise of the Khmer Rouges forces has brought some peace to the country and strengthened the forces of the co - premiers , but questioned whether those gains meant true peace for Cambodia . The timber - and gem - rich former bases of Phnom Malai and Pailin have enriched individuals and political parties but not the nation as a whole , the king noted . Sihanouk also cautioned against the ex - Khmer Rouge ' s autonomy and the " big danger " of their possible role in elections . He said their participation in local and national elections , scheduled for 1997 and 1998 , would emperil democracy and exacerbate tensions between the co - premiers . The Khmer Rouge signed a U . N . - sponsored peace pact in 1991 , but later reneged on the deal and had been fighting the coalition government formed in 1993 .

Airline stocks fall after downgrades . U . S . airline stocks tumbled Tuesday after several brokerages trimmed earnings estimates , citing pressure from fare sales and the return of a federal ticket tax . The American Stock Exchange airline index dropped nearly 16 points , or 3 . 3 percent , to 460 . The Dow Jones transportation average slipped 1 . 33 percent to 2 , 663 points , compared with a 0 . 61 percent gain in the Dow industrials . Hardest hit were American Airlines parent AMR Corp . , which fell $ 4 . 625 to $ 94 . 50 and Continental Airlines Inc . , off $ 2 . 375 points at $ 34 , both in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange . " All the companies are talking estimates down , " said Helane Becker , an airline analyst with Smith Barney . Becker said her earnings forecasts have been lower than the Wall Street consensus because of concerns about the federal passenger excise tax , which was reimposed in March . " I ' m surprised the companies weren ' t more cautious in their conference calls " when they released their first quarter results and made projections about the second quarter , Becker said . The 10 percent excise tax was absent throughout the second quarter of 1996 , allowing airlines to cull funds that normally go to the Federal Aviation Administration . Without those extra funds this year , comparisons to last year ' s second quarter will be more difficult , analysts said . The impact of the excise tax is not a surprise . But the combination of the tax and recent fare sales have made the second quarter outlook less rosy , analysts said . Investment banker Lehman Brothers cut several airline stocks ' outlooks Tuesday , saying revenue weakness will sharply cut into profits at Delta Air Lines Inc . , Northwest Airlines Corp . and Trans World Airlines Inc . First Boston analyst Tom Schreier said recent fare sales also ate away at second quarter revenues . The sales generated air traffic at the expense of revenue yield , he said . A fare sale by Delta " put too much inventory on sale at too low a price , " Schreier said . Although high - yield business travel remains steady , the growth has been in low - fare leisure travel , analysts said . On Monday , Delta said unit revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter ending in June would be only slightly ahead of levels recorded a year ago . A Delta spokesman cited the return of the excise tax and said growth in leisure travel had hurt yields . Delta lost $ 3 . 75 to $ 88 on the NYSE .

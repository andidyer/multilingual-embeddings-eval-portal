Belgian franc wins vote of confidence , OLOs shine . The Belgian franc appeared to have put an end on Wednesday to its recent slide which pushed the currency to well above its 20 . 6255 ERM midpoint , dealers said . " There is a consensus that 20 . 64 is not so bad after all and since everything is quiet on the political front , it should soon return to its midpoint , " one trader said . At 1405 GMT , the franc was at 20 . 6395 / 00 to the mark against 20 . 6410 / 20 late on Tuesday . Dealers said the franc had not affected short - term rates . " So bonds certainly stayed out of trouble , " one said . OLOs built further on early gains in line with Bunds with the 10 - year OLO yielding 5 . 78 percent against 5 . 81 percent in early business and 5 . 83 percent at the close on Tuesday . The OLO / Bund yield premium was at 10 basis points against 11 on Tuesday . Dealers noted some trading in OLOs 26 ( 2007 ) and 14 ( 2004 ) and a flurry of buying interest in the short end in OLOs 11 , 13 and 21 ( maturing in 1998 , 1999 and 2000 respectively ) . But they noted that overall business remained slack and feared that once again , key U . S . data due later this week would fail to revive spirits and trade . The market ' s next target is Thursday ' s U . S . CPI , seen at 2 . 6 percent . " It looks though that there will be nothing new under the sun , it ' s been like this for the past two months now , " one trader said . - - Bert Lauwers , Brussels Newsroom + 32 2 287 6815 , Fax + 32 2 230 7710

Polish c . bank knocks down foreign - charged zloty . The National Bank of Poland ( NBP ) bought currencies on the forex market for the second time this week and again sank the zloty , propelled upward by foreign entry into high - yielding Polish treasuries , dealers said . The small intervention , which drained a dealer estimated $ 25 million today , caused a short - lived panic on the market and send the zloty tumbling half a percentage point from intraday highs around 3 . 55 percent from the trading band centre . " The intervention was small , but the market was nervous and will stay cautious tomorrow . . . with the new range for the zloty between 3 . 0 - 3 . 5 percent , " said Pawel Lopuszynski of Pekao SA . The zloty closed at 3 . 13 / 3 . 00 percent from the trading band centre against Tuesday ' s close at 3 . 31 / 3 . 27 percent . It closed at 2 . 9650 / 00 to the dollar , down from 2 . 9430 / 45 on Tuesday and at 1 . 8075 / 00 to the mark , up from 1 . 8138 / 47 . Dealers said the NBP purchased dollars at 2 . 9570 zlotys and marks at 1 . 8070 zlotys , but they said that there may have been purchases at other levels as well . Dealers said Wednesday ' s statements by Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko in support a strong zloty in 1997 , despite expectations of a booming current account gap , were likley to keep foreigners bullish on Polish treasuries . Kolodko said that if year - on - year producer price growth was 10 . 6 percent in December 1997 , the expected 9 . 1 percent zloty devaluation for this year would mean that the actual currency appreciation would be marginal and should not hit exporters . Over the past weeks foreign investors bought some $ 350 million of Polish bills and bonds , but some foreigners sold paper on Wednesday to take profit on the rising zloty . " Before the central bank intervention pushed down the zloty some more speculative investors sold small amounts of bills to take profits , but there were also takers today , " said one foreign bank dealer in Warsaw .

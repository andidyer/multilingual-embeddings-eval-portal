Romance that roused Imelda Marcos ' s ire ends . A romance between Imelda Marcos ' s daughter and a sportsman that provoked the wrath of the former Philippine first lady has ended with the couple breaking up . " Tommy and Imee Manotoc have agreed to live separately to enable them to reflect and sort out their marriage differences before taking a more decisive action on their relations , " said the two - sentence announcement released to Reuters on Thursday . A smiling Imee Manotoc waved off reporters ' questions when she flew in on Thursday from Singapore where the Manotocs have been living for several years with their three children . " For a mother , this is the ultimate pain , part of the strain of more than 10 years of relentless persecution of the Marcoses , " Imelda Marcos said in a brief statement about the break - up of her daughter ' s 15 - year - long marriage . She did not explain in what way the marital separation was a form of persecution . The announcement ended a romance that stirred the nation and gained international publicity when news of it broke in 1981 . That was when Ferdinand Marcos was ruling the Philippines by decree . But unknown to the Marcoses , Tommy Manotoc , an international amateur golfer , had eloped with their eldest daughter , marrying her in a civil ceremony in the Dominican Republic after a quick divorce from his first wife , Aurora Pijuan , a former Miss International beauty queen . Imelda Marcos had fiercely opposed the liaison . Soon after the marriage , Tommy Manotoc disappeared and his family accused Marcos ' s men of abducting him . Nothing was heard of him until the presidential palace announced 43 days later that government troops had " rescued " Manotoc from communist guerrillas were said to have abducted him . The Manotocs ' separation was the latest blow to a family that ruled the Philippines virtually unchallenged for 20 years until Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown in a popular 1986 revolt and fled to Hawaii where he died three years later . His flamboyant widow , Imelda , who says she is virtually penniless but lives in a luxury Manila apartment adorned with expensive paintings , was convicted by a Manila court of corruption charges in 1993 and sentenced to 18 years in jail . She is out on bail while the case is on appeal but faces scores of other criminal and civil suits for alleged tax evasion , corruption and illegal money transfers . The Marcoses ' lone son , Ferdinand Jr or Bongbong , is appealing against a nine - year jail term for alleged tax evasion . Imee Manotoc , too , faces tax evasion charges . In 1994 , a Hawaii jury ordered the Marcos estate to pay $ 1 . 2 billion in damages to 10 , 000 victims of human rights abuses . Another Hawaiian jury last July awarded a $ 22 billion judgement against the family in a lawsuit filed by lawyers for a Filipino locksmith who had accused Ferdinand Marcos of stealing a Buddha statue supposedly made of gold from him in the 1970s .

Shareholders like Guinness Nigeria scrip . Shareholders of Guinness Nigeria now appear keen to increase their stake in the company by way of scrip dividend , an arrangement most of them rejected last year , dealers said . The scheme was turned down by shareholders at the company ' s annual general meeting last year mainly because they said the offer price was higher than the ruling market price . But Guinness said this week it was re - introducing the scheme because it enables shareholders to increase their holding without adding dealing costs . Another reason why it failed last year , dealers said , was because the company did not inform shareholders early , creating the impression that there was a hidden motive . They said the company was also pursuing it to save funds . " Some of our clients prefer the scrip dividend to cash because they consider the 80 kobo dividend a paltry sum , " trader Dumebi Ohanwusi of Networth Securities said on Thursday . " The scrip dividend appears more attractive , " he added . Those not interested are entitled to collect their dividend in cash , according to Ulu Mba , the Guinness spokesman . " There is no compulsion to opt for scrip , " he added . " To allow for transparency , the conversion price shall be the closing price on the ( stock market ) on the date of the annual general meeting , " Mba said in a statement . With this arrangement , he said the perceived disadvantages of the scrip dividend had been revised in line with shareholders ' expectations . Analysts said Guinness ' determination to pursue the option portrayed it as a company with future plans . " A company with plans for the future should be doing this kind of retention , " said Tunde Ayeni of CSL Stockbrokers . Guinness said its turnover grew 11 percent in the 1996 fiscal year to 8 . 9 billion naira from eight billion naira in 1995 and profit after tax rose by 22 percent to 437 . 8 million against 358 . 7 million naira in the previous year . Its annual general meeting takes place on June 19 . ( $ 1 = 85 naira ) - - Lagos newsroom + 234 1 263 03 17

GOLF - PRICE SEIZES SECOND - ROUND LEAD . Zimbabwe ' s Nick Price seized the lead with a brilliant six - under - par 66 on the third morning of the Dimension Data Pro - Am golf tournament on Saturday . Price ' s score was the best this week on the Gary Player Country Club course , following his opening 67 on Thursday , and gave him an 11 - under total of 133 . Price leads by one shot from four players , David Frost and John Wade , the clubhouse leaders when the second round was curtailed by a thunderstorm on Friday , England ' s Gary Evans and Thomas Bjorn . Bjorn , playing with Price , shot a five - under 67 after birdies on the first three holes on Friday . Both he and Price had completed nine holes when play was called off for the day . The players began the third round from split tees , the organisers having dispensed with amateurs in an effort to speed up play . Weather permitting , the amateurs will rejoin the professionals in the final round on Sunday .

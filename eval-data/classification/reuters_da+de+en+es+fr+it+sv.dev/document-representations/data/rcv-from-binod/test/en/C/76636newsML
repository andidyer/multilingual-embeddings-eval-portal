Profits , turnover fall at German broker J & H . Germany ' s leading insurance broker Jauch & Huebener suffered a deterioration in its turnover and results in 1995 . In its annual report , the company said that its after - tax result worsened from a loss of 3 . 5 million marks in 1994 to a 4 . 4 million marks loss in 1995 . Turnover from commissions and other sources dropped by 1 . 1 percent from 314 . 1 million marks to 310 . 8 million marks . But the group said that it expects a profit again for 1996 . " Our result contains write - downs totalling 26 million marks on goodwill and commission rights , as well as interest on shareholders ' loans , " Christian Dahms , spokesman of the managing partners , told Reuters . " If you consider that , we did not do too badly . " However , 1995 had been worse than 1994 , which was only partly due to the costs of moving to a new office building . German industrial business in particular saw massive changes last year , the company said . Industrial fire premium rates fell sharply " within weeks " in mid - 1995 . Large customers were more than ever prepared to carry high deductibles , while at the same time seeking to replace commission income with fee - based systems . " Generally , a sharp squeeze on commissions was felt , " said Jauch & Huebener . " It was not possible to offset the reduction in turnover through newly acquired business . " In reinsurance broking , too , commission income was under pressure , the company said . Mergers in both the insurance and reinsurance sector caused a reduction in the number of market participants . In addition J & H said , " The lack of natural catastrophes led to an overcapacity in this field , with consequent rate reductions , " adding that primary insurers ceded less business to reinsurers . This led to reduced volume and thus lower commission income . To counter these trends , Jauch & Huebener is seeking to develop new markets for its reinsurance broking division , especially in South America and the Far East . The adverse market conditions showed through clearly in the results . The company posted an operating loss - - before the financial result - - of 4 . 6 million marks , after a 2 . 8 million marks profit the year before . The financial activities added a loss of 0 . 8 million marks , after a 3 . 7 million marks loss in 1994 . This led to a 1995 loss before tax and extraordinary items of 5 . 39 million marks , compared with 0 . 89 million the year before . The company ' s shareholders agreed to forgive loans of 2 . 4 million marks . The after - tax loss was largely covered by reserves . " Considerable efforts " were needed to achieve a turnaround in 1996 , the company said . The reinsurance broking result would be down by 3 . 4 million marks this year . In primary insurance broking , J & H expects a result similar to that of 1995 . Positive trends could be noted in advisory work for company pension schemes and in private customer business . J & H , which employed 1 , 426 staff at the year - end , belongs to the international Unison broking network . In addition to Germany , where it writes around 90 percent of its business , the company concentrates on Austria and Switzerland and , more recently , eastern Europe . - - Reuters Insurance News 44 171 542 2769

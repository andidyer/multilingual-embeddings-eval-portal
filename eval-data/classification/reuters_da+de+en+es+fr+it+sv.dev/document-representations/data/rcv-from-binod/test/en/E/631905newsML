Kohl - revaluation will not hurt Buba ' s independence . German chancellor Helmit Kohl said on Monday that the revaluation of Bundesbank reserves did not infringe on the Bundesbank ' s independence and was entirely legitimate . " Let me state here , clearly and categorically : in no way does the revaluation of the Bundesbank reserves amount to an infringement of the independence of the Bundesbank . " Nor does it mean selling a single gramme of gold or a single dollar , " he said in the text of a speech to be delivered to a banking conference . " An independent central bank is a prime asset , " he said . The Bundesbank last week issued a strongly - worded statement protesting against Bonn ' s plans to call for a transfer of book profits notched up as a result of the revaluation of assets both this year and next , saying it hurt its independence . The central bank argued that this should not take place until 1999 , or at least not before it is decided who will participate in monetary union in May 1998 . Kohl said there was no justification for predictions that the gold revaluation plan would cause inflation dangers . " We for our part want to begin already in 1997 with a revaluation closer to market levels and partial payout , " he said . He added that it was fully legitimate to revalue these reserves now and not in 1999 . The income would be used to ease future debt and interest rate burdens and not for direct reduction of the deficit . " Contrary to many reports , the other funds released from reserve assets as a result of a revaluation will on no account be used to plug any gaps in the budget . " Rather they will be used to reduce the future burden of debt and interest payments , from which in the end the taxpayer stands to benefit , since the total of 20 billion marks will be set aside to redeem the historic burdens of the german democratic republic . " According to a separate summary of his speech , Kohl said it was obvious that Germany sought to , and would , meet the Maastricht deficit criteria , although its consolidation programme was inevitable in any case .

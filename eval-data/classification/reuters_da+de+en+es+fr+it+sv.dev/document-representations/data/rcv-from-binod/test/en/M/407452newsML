SIMEX Eurodollars recover from Greenspan comments . SIMEX Eurodollar futures ended firmer in active trade on Thursday as U . S . T - bonds recovered in Tokyo after plunging overnight on comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan . In the first of a two - part speech to the U . S . Senate Banking Committee , Greenspan expressed concern about soaring stock prices and hinted at the possibility of a pre - emptive interest rate hike to keep inflation in check . " There was some good bargain hunting in Tokyo today and also when London came in . We saw real dollar interest - - from investors rather than speculators , " said a trader with a European futures house . June Eurodollars ended at 94 . 27 against their IMM close at 94 . 25 on volume of 12 , 735 lots . September were at 94 . 08 against 94 . 04 on 12 , 520 lots . Euroyen futures remained practically stagnant as Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures for March struggled with a stubborn technical barrier at 126 . 41 . Dealers said JGB volumes were exaggerated by players rolling over their positions to the June contract ahead of March ' s expiry . March ended at 126 . 33 against its previous 126 . 45 after hitting a high of 126 . 41 on an ask - only basis . " JGBs are still consolidating . They need to break 126 . 41 on the Marches to head back up , " said the trader , adding however , that the bond futures looked supported by supply and demand conditions in the cash market . Euroyen futures were unmoved by a jump in the key overnight call loan rate to 0 . 53 percent , its highest since April 3 , 1996 , as banks scrambled to raise funds at the short - end of the market . Dealers said comments by a Japanese official noting that the rise was due to month - end demand and the Bank of Japan was committed to keeping the overnight rate below 0 . 50 percent threw water on any potential fears of a rate hike . December Euroyen was quoted at 99 . 21 at 1115 GMT against its IMM finish at 99 . 23 with volume exceeding September for the second straight day . - - Sonali Desai ( 65 - 8703090 )

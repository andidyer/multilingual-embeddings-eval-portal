Yeltsin , Blair discuss NATO deal by telephone . Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke to newly elected British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday about a document on Russia ' s ties with the NATO alliance , a Kremlin statement said . The Kremlin said Yeltsin congratulated Blair on his May 1 election win and invited him to visit Moscow . The invitation was accepted , but the Kremlin gave no date for the visit . The statement said the two men discussed a document currently being prepared on Russia ' s relations with NATO and looked at how to strengthen security and stability in Europe . Russia fears that NATO ' s plans to invite new members from central and eastern Europe to join could threaten its own security , but accepts it can do little to prevent expansion taking place . Yeltsin , who has promised to speak to Western leaders by telephone on the NATO issue , hopes to go to Paris to sign the document on May 27 . He told Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday to take a tough line in the talks .

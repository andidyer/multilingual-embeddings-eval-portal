Bank Austria ups CA bid to 17 . 2 bln ATS - paper . Bank Austria has increased its offer for buying the government ' s stake in key bank Creditanstalt to 17 . 2 billion schillings from 16 . 7 billion , an Austrian newspaper said on Saturday . The improved offer ensures that market leader Bank Austria remains the highest bidder for the country ' s number two bank , daily Der Standard said . Finance Minister Viktor Klima has repeatedly stressed that he is bound by Austrian and European Union law to sell the state ' s stake of 19 . 9 million ordinary voting shares to the highest offer . Bank Austria ' s closest rival , an international group led by insurer EA - Generali , also raised its offer on Friday but trails far behind Bank Austria at 15 . 1 billion schillings , the paper said . The group originally bid 13 . 8 billion . No one in the Finance Ministry was immediately available for confirmation . Klima said he would announce the winner of the seven - year fight for control of Creditanstalt before Tuesday , when parliament is due to hold a special session on the politically contentious sale .

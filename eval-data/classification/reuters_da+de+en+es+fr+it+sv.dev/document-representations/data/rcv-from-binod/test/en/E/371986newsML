Yugo unlikely to reach ' 97 export target - minister . Yugoslavia is unlikely to meet its target of increasing exports by 48 percent this year unless the country reintegrates in the international community , Yugoslav trade minister Djordje Siradovic said on Wednesday . " It will be very difficult to export if Yugoslavia remains isolated by the international community , " he told Reuters . " Political blockade and political confrontations must be eliminated prior to any increase of exports . " Yugoslavia , comprising Serbia and Montenegro , expected a 48 percent exports rise in 1997 to be the main pillar of economic growth targeted at 13 percent . But a so - called " outer wall " of sanctions still in place after the lifting of international sanctions last October prevents Belgrade ' s access to fresh foreign funds as well as to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . WTO membership would rid Yugoslav goods of customs tariffs and give them equal treatment on the world market . It would also open up the national economy to foreign competition which would force domestic producers to improve on price and quality . " The competitiveness of Yugoslav goods abroad is very low , " Siradovic said . " Structural changes and ownership transformation are the main prerequisites for improving it . " Yugoslavia ' s trade deficit last year reached $ 2 . 26 billion , with exports worth $ 1 . 84 billion and imports $ 4 . 1 billion . Officials say last year ' s export growth was well below the targeted 50 percent while imports rose more rapidly , exceeding the projected $ 3 . 5 billion . Comparative data for 1995 is not available due to trade embargo then in place . Analysts agreed that any sizeable export growth depended on radical reforms and privatisation . " The 1996 trade gap is not a consequence of an economic policy but a result of the structure of our economy , " said one analyst who asked not to be named . Yugoslavia would have to export goods worth around $ 2 . 7 billion to achieve its export target , which would require imports of equipment and raw materials worth $ 6 billion . January exports stood at $ 132 million , but imports were $ 323 million . " The problem is to finance such a gap as it is obvious that exports rise at a slower pace than imports , " the source said . " This implies a rise in production which cannot be achieved without fresh investments . . . And there are no foreign investments as long as the outer wall of sanctions is in place . It is a vicious circle , " another analyst said . - - Gordana Kukic , Belgrade Newsroom + + 381 11 222 4254

INSIGHT - Gilts pause , penned in by 113 - 08 , 113 - 28 . June gilt futures look set to consolidate on Tuesday , with the market likely penned in between 113 - 08 and 113 - 28 , technical analysts said . Andy Cossor , fixed income analyst at Technical Data here , said the market was trying to form a top around the 114 - 24 level on May 9 - - an area the market has tested a few times in recent days . " The market wants to pause to consolidate , " he said . " I don ' t think we ' ll see a clear direction until the FOMC is out of the way , both gilt auctions and the UK retail sales and M4 numbers . " Cossor said it was too early for the market to break below 112 - 28 , the May 8 low and the bottom of the recent upmove . " If the market did break below that , I would take a more negative view and look to 111 - 26 , " said Cossor . Charts show the market hit a daily high of 111 - 26 on March 12 . He said investors were paring back long positions as the Relative Strength Index turned down from its overbought levels and momentum indicators turned neutral . " I imagine that process started on Friday and I suspect there ' s a bit more to be done , which will likely drag the market down a bit , " he said . By 0710 GMT , the June gilt was up 3 / 32 at 113 - 17 . The 14 day RSI was at 63 . 6 percent , down from 79 . 2 percent on May 12 . A reading above 70 percent suggests the market is overbought . Above 113 - 28 , Cossor put minor resistance at 114 - 00 , then a congestion area on daily charts at 114 - 07 . Richard Adcock , technical research manager at HSBC Futures , also said he expected further unwinding of the overbought reading , with a possible decline down to 113 - 00 at least . " A normal 38 percent retracement of the advance can see falls to 111 - 26 , suggesting pullbacks continue to offer selling opportunities , " he said in a note . By 0717 GMT , September short sterling was unchanged at 93 . 22 .

U . S . ' s Price sees no new trade trend with Japan . Commerce Department economist Lee Price said Thursday he does not see a new trend of rising trade deficits with Japan reflected in the April trade data . " There ' s no real trend there , " Price told Reuters Financial Television . " There is very sluggish export activity with Japan , their domestic demand is not particularly strong . Our import growth from Japan , about three percent for the first four months of the year , is also not particularly different from our imports from the rest of the world , a little bit slower . " Price said the trade gap with Western Europe in April following a surplus in March , reflected exceptionally strong exports of aircraft and gold to Europe in March . " We hope the trend is for improved exports because the European economies seem to be picking up some growth and that should help our exports , " Price said . Price said an improvement in the trade balance with Canada in April reflected a stronger Canadian economy . Price also said trade trends with Mexico were improving with export growth outpacing import growth . He said the export trend to both Mexico and Canada was " promising . " He added that U . S . export growth to the rest of Latin America has also outpaced the growth of imports from that region .

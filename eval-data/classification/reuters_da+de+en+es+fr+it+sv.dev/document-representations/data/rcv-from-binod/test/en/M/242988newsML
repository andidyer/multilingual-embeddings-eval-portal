Dollar ends up in Europe as asset markets recover . The dollar closed up one pfennig in European trading , buoyed by a recovery in global stock and bond markets from last week ' s shake - out , traders said . " The dollar is in much better shape and has been given an extra boost by buying from U . S . banks this afternoon , " said Pat Magill , head of the corporate desk at Daiwa Europe in London . European monetary union ( EMU ) issues moved back to the top of traders ' agendas at the start of a week full of high level European Union ( EU ) meetings . At 1554 GMT the dollar was at session highs at 1 . 5575 / 82 marks , up from 1 . 5460 / 70 in late European trading on Friday . Dollar / yen rose along with dollar / mark and stood at 113 . 24 / 29 from 112 . 78 / 88 at Friday ' s European close . Calmer conditions in global markets were helped by comments by U . S . Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , Bank of England Governor Eddie George and Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer , who all said the reaction to remarks by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had been excessive . Greenspan ' s comments on markets ' " irrational exuberance " helped trigger a global stock market slide on Friday , dragging bonds and the dollar down with them . Traders noted that part of the decline last week had been due to year - end profit - taking . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said after a meeting with French president Jacques Chirac that neither France nor Germany want a soft single currency . The two leaders met ahead of the EU summit in Dublin on December 13 / 14 . Delegation sources said there was little progress on a stability pact to ensure fiscal discipline within EMU . Germany is at odds with France , and most of the rest of the EU , in trying to set up a very strict budget pact . The mark was mixed on its European crosses , firmer against a generally weak Swiss franc , steady against the French franc but weaker against the high - yielding lira , peseta and Swedish crown .

Cummins sees Q2 topping Q1 if markets hold . Cummins Engine Co Inc said it expects earnings in the second quarter to top the first - quarter level if business conditions hold . " We believe that if business conditions continue as they are now , we expect higher earnings in the second quarter than the first , " said chief executive Jim Henderson . The company on Wednesday reported first - quarter 1997 net earnings of $ 41 million on sales of $ 1 . 30 billion , versus earnings of $ 49 million on sales of $ 1 . 32 billion a year ago . " Strong performance in our industrial , power generation , and bus and light commercial vehicle businesses , compared to the first quarter of last year , was the result of our product and market diversification programs . In addition , business conditions continue to be favorable in most of our markets worldwide , " Henderson said . He added Cummins is pleased with quarterly sales to industrial markets of $ 257 million , up 27 percent over a year ago and reflecting strong sales for construction equipment in North America and agricultural equipment in certain international markets . North American heavy - duty truck engine shipments were 13 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 1996 . " We believe that this market has strengthened , " Henderson said , " and resulted in the higher level of shipments . " Sales of $ 295 million to the heavy - duty truck market worldwide were nearly 20 percent lower than the year - ago quarter , due primarily to the decline in the North American portion of this market , the company said . Midrange truck engine sales of $ 132 million were 18 percent lower than the first quarter of 1996 due to lower truck demand in North America , Cummins said . In the bus and light commercial vehicles market , sales of $ 171 million were eight percent higher than the first quarter of 1996 . Power Generation sales of $ 275 million were nine percent higher than the first quarter of 1996 .

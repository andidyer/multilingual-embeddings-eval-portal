Canada making inroads in Philippine wheat market . Canadian wheat exporters have begun to make modest inroads into a Philippine market long dominated by the United States , an industry official said on Tuesday . Ricardo Pinca , a former executive director of the Philippine Association of Flour Millers ( PAFMIL ) , told a Singapore conference staged by the U . S . wheat industry that Canadian wheat exports to Manila this year already matched the level set last year . He said Canadian wheat exports have already reached 120 , 000 tonnes , the same level reached in all of 1996 . " We see U . S . wheat ' s stranglehold on the market decreasing . Expect the Canadians to increase their exports in the Philippines , " Pinca said . Millers in the Philippines turned to Canadian exporters after finding U . S . wheat prices too hiogh over the last few months . The Philippines imported nearly two million tonnes of wheat last year . Around 1 . 6 million tonnes came from the United States , industry officials said . - - Singapore Newsroom ( 65 - 8703305 )

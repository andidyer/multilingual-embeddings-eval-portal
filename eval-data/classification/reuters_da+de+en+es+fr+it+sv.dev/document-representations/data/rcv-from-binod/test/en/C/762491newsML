Analysts see SPT H1 net CZK 2 . 8 - 3 . 3 bln . The Czech fixed - line telephone monopoly SPT Telecom a . s . should post first - half after - tax profit of between 2 . 8 to 3 . 3 billion crowns when interim results are released mid - week , analysts said on Tuesday . The forecasts , according to international accounting standards in a poll of several Prague - based analysts , meant expectations were for flat to mild net profit growth over last year ' s six - month result of 2 . 82 billion crowns . " I don ' t think that the results should influence the share price , " said Vaclav Verner of Zivnostenska Banka . " My correct price is 4 , 000 crowns , and I recommend a buy . " Shares of SPT , the most - capitalised Czech stock , closed 85 crowns higher at 3 , 800 on the Prague Stock Exchange ( PSE ) on Tuesday ahead of results which are due to be released on Wednesday at 10 . 00 a . m . ( 0800 GMT ) . For the year - to - date , SPT has outperformed the PSE ' s PX50 index by 16 . 84 percent , as the company ' s stock has gained 9 . 72 percent while the index has dropped 6 . 1 percent . " I recommend a buy ( of SPT shares ) . I expect that by the end of the year the share price can reach 4 , 000 crowns , " said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance . Leos Jirman of Delta Securities said SPT ' s interim profit growth would be flat , hampered by exposure to credit financing . " At the end of the half - year interest rates rose , and SPT has been financing part of its activities with the help of credits , " Jirman said . The survey said six - month net profit under Czech accounting standards , which vary in writeoff rules among others , should total 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 billion crowns after 2 . 95 billion last year . The company ' s 1997 earnings are also expected to take somewhat of a hit from lost service due to flooding in the eastern part of the country earlier this month , but those will not be reflected in the interim figures . Still analysts said they see SPT as stable and safe . " The company is developing according to plan and has no volatility , " said Verner of Zivnostenska . In June , SPT shareholders approved a board proposal for a 10 - for - 1 stock split to add liquidity to the pricey SPT shares . Investor relations manager Bart Morselt told Reuters on Tuesday that the company hoped to execute the split by the year ' s end , but several regulatory approval steps still needed to be completed . SPT shares rose above the 3 , 000 - crown range from just above 2 , 000 crowns after a 27 percent stake in the former state monopoly was privatised in the summer of 1995 to a consortium comprised of Dutch and Swiss PTT operators . SPT posted a 483 million crown 1996 IAS net loss as the company took one - off restructuring charges of 8 . 757 billion crowns after a 4 . 83 billion crown net profit for 1995 . About 1 . 75 billion crowns of the charge came as the firm prepares for layoffs and restructuring that should see SPT shed some 10 , 000 of its current 26 , 800 workforce by the year 2000 . The company is seeking to increase line capacity to over four million from about two million lines in operation when modernisation plans went into full force earlier this decade . The company does not plan to pay a dividend until after the turn of the century , electing to plough disposable profit back into development .

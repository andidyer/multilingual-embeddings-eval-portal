Italian shares sluggish , Olivetti stands out . Italian stocks ended largely steady in sluggish trading on Wednesday , with the focus on Olivetti shares which bounced around violently after the surprising resignation late Tuesday of group chairman Carlo De Benedetti . Olivetti rocked higher to be suspended early up 10 percent before the trading ceiling was widened to 15 percent and hit a high of 820 lire , up almost 13 percent , but then slipped back as dealers digested the sharp first - half loss , more restructuring and soaring debt . The shares ended up 3 . 31 percent at 750 lire . All - share Mibtel ended up 0 . 03 percent up at 9 , 339 and the blue - chip Mib30 index off 0 . 15 percent at 13 , 861 . After the shock news of De Benedetti bowing out after a reported clash with chief executive Francesco Caio , many operators decided to go short of the stock , dealers said . " But the problems have not been addressed , a lawyer has taken over as chairman , CIR is still a big shareholder , and the the results were awful , " said one share trader in Milan . He added that it was still too early to say if Olivetti had turned the corner after reporting five years of losses with 1996 likely to make it a sixth year after a 440 . 2 billion lire pretax loss for the first half of 1996 . Overall , the market slipped after a slightly positive start following an early fall on Wall Street and continuing background worries over the 1997 Italian financial budget . Among other stocks , Fiat continued to slide , off 0 . 53 percent at 4 , 464 lire and Montedison was down 0 . 97 percent at 945 lire .

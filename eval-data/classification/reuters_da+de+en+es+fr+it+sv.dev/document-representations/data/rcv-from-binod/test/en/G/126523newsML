Poverty is toughest task for next Nicaragua leader . The winner of Nicaragua ' s presidential election will face the monumental task of rebuilding the economy of one of Latin America ' s poorest countries , where more than half the population lacks a job . The main contenders in Sunday ' s election are right - wing lawyer Arnoldo Aleman of the Liberal Alliance and former President Daniel Ortega of the left - wing Sandinista Front . Nicaragua was once known as the " breadbasket of Latin America " for its abundant farmland , but it has fallen on hard times following a bloody left - right civil war in the 1980s , a U . S . blockade and a failed socialist economic policy . Grinding poverty has turned into the central election issue - - who can create the jobs to put food on the table of Nicaragua ' s poor . Economist Mario Arana said the issue has benefited Ortega , whose popularity in the polls has soared from 20 percent at the start of 1996 to 39 percent today . Ortega , who headed Nicaragua ' s Marxist Sandinista government from 1979 to 1990 , is running a close second to Aleman . Sunday ' s election victor needs 45 percent of the votes to win outright . Otherwise the two top candidates will face each other in a runoff in late November or early December . Recent polls show it is not clear whether a winner will emerge in the first round . The statistics that will face the new president are daunting : 54 percent combined unemployment and underemployment , 75 percent of the population with unsatisfied basic needs , one of the highest debt burdens in the world and an economy propped up by foreign aid . At a traffic light with a rag in his hand to wipe the windscreens of passing cars , Rodrigo Pichardo , 33 , lifts up his shirt and points to his prominent ribs . " I do this because I ' m hungry . I ' d vote for anyone who puts food on my table , " said Pichardo , who had a low - level municipal job in Managua before he lost it to austerity cuts in the early 1990s . Children crowd Managua ' s street corners begging for change , crime and prostitution are soaring and the suicide rate is up 20 percent over 1995 , police statistics show . Wages are miserable for those Nicaraguans who have jobs . A doctor in a state hospital makes about $ 100 a month , a nurse $ 50 - 60 a month , and prostitutes get as little as $ 5 a trick . A 1996 United Nations study labeled Nicaragua the most underdeveloped country in Latin America after Haiti , citing per capita income , life expectancy and educational levels . A CID - Gallup poll showed that 77 percent of Nicaraguans think poverty is the most important election issue . The two leading presidential candidates have both made job creation their main priority but are weak on details on how to do it . The main challenge is to " drag this country forward out of the immense poverty and misery into which it has sunk , and the only way to do this is through jobs , " said Aleman , a burly , right - wing populist who has said he will work to boost Nicaragua ' s agricultural sector . Ortega has added his voice to the anti - poverty chorus , promising to be the " candidate of the poor . " " It ' s the economy . When all is said and done people vote with their stomachs and right now the people are suffering , " Carlos Denton , the president of CID - Gallup Costa Rica , said .

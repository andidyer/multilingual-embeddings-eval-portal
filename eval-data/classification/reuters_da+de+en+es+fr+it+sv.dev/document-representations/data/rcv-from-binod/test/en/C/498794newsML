Schweitzer - Mauduit backs ' 97 EPS $ 2 . 65 - $ 2 . 70 . The chief financial officer of Schweitzer - Mauduit International Inc said Thursday he supports Wall Street analysts ' 1997 earnings per share forecasts of $ 2 . 65 - $ 2 . 70 . " We ' re comfortable with that if there are no surprises , " said CFO Paul Roberts in an interview after he spoke at the annual Robinson - Humphrey institutional conference . The one potential surprise was always a spike in pulp prices . Most analysts , however , are forecasting subdued pulp prices for at least the near future . Schweitzer - Mauduit is the leading manufacturer of paper for cigarettes . The company ' s chairman and chief executive , Wayne Dietrich , told analysts that prospects for the company ' s cigarette paper were particularly good in eastern Europe , China and the former Soviet Union . One of the company ' s goals was to increase unit volume six percent annually . A component of that strategy is to " focus on China , eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union , " he said . Tobacco industry analysts say that , while the cigarette market is mature in North America , it is still a growth market elsewhere , particularly in the areas cited by Dietrich . Last year , 75 percent of the Alpharetta , Georgia - based company ' s operating profits came from outside the United States . Dietrich also said in an interview that 40 percent of Philip Morris Cos Inc ' s domestic cigarette production is exported . Schweitzer - Mauduit is the sole paper supplier to Philip Morris , the world ' s largest cigarette manufacturer . Schweitzer - Mauduit was split off by Kimberly - Clark Corp in November 1995 .

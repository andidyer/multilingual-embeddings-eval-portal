Pan Am buying Carnival Air , adding $ 60 million in financing . Pan American World Airways , a new company with a venerable name , announced a major expansion Friday , saying it would acquire Carnival Air Lines . It also said it had arranged an additional $ 60 million in financing . Pan Am Corp . , which began operations last September with just two airliners , did not reveal financial terms of its agreement to acquire privately held Carnival Air , a regional airline with a fleet of 27 jet aircraft . It said , however , that as part of the deal , Micky Arison , the majority owner of Carnival Air , would invest $ 30 million in the combined company , giving him a 42 percent stake . Arison is chairman and chief executive of Carnival Corp . , which operates Carnival Cruse Lines . But Carnival Air is not part of that company and is owned by Air Holding Corp . Pan Am also said it had arranged a private placement of up to $ 30 million in a new series of convertible preferred stock . Carnival Air , which was formed in 1988 , has operations in South Florida , the Northeast , California and the Caribbean . It had about $ 270 million in revenues last year . " The Carnival Air acquisition elevates Pan Am to a stronger competitive position and provides significant benefits of critical mass in an expedited , yet controlled manner , " Pan Am President and Chief Executive Martin R . Shugrue Jr . said in a statement . Last July Pan Am agreed to buy Carnival Air for about $ 100 million but called off the deal after PanAm examined the carrier ' s books and sought to rework the terms . Pan Am currently has a fleet of four Airbus A300 ' s - - with two more to be delivered in the next two months - - flying between New York and Los Angeles , New York and Miami , New York and San Juan , Peurto Rico , Miami and Chicago , and Miami and San Juan . It plans to begin service between New York and Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic , on April 6 . The original Pan Am , one of the world ' s first airlines , went out of business amid a myriad of problems related to competition , its limited route structure , industry deregulation and finally , the bombing of one of its airliners over Lockerbie , Scotland in 1988 . Shugrue , who once headed the now - defunct Eastern Airlines , acquired the rights to the Pan Am name after the company went out of existence and later founded the new Pan Am , which is based in Miami . Pan Am ' s stock fell 37 . 5 cents to $ 10 . 50 in early trading on the American Stock Exchange , where it was among the most - actively traded issues .

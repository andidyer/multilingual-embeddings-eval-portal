Beleaguered Swiss government wants Holocaust fund . The Swiss government , pressured by Jewish groups to make restitution for alleged Swiss profiteering from the Holocaust , said on Tuesday it wanted to use dormant Swiss bank accounts to create a Holocaust memorial fund . But the Federal Council , or cabinet , ignored Jewish demands that it rebuke Economics Minister Jean - Pascal Delamuraz for dismissing their calls for compensation as " extortion and blackmail " . " There was no apology by the Federal Council because the remarks ( by Delamuraz ) were misunderstood and led to excessive reactions , " government spokesman Achille Casanova told reporters after the seven ministers conferred by phone for 90 minutes . In a statement , the cabinet criticised threats by Jewish groups to call a boycott of Swiss banks and said they endangered joint efforts to track Jewish wealth sent to neutral Switzerland to escape the Nazis during World War Two . The cabinet said it wanted dormant bank accounts totalling around 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 29 . 5 million ) to be " put to a proper use " . " In this respect , the Federal Council is ready to immediately take up discussions with the banks and the interested organisations regarding the creation of a fund in favour of Holocaust victims and their descendants , " the statement said . The government insists such a fund would not be an admission that Switzerland and its secretive banks profited cynically from the war . It left open potential compensation payments for Jews but only if a probe by historians proved Switzerland acted dishonourably during the war . Berne had been under mounting pressure to show goodwill towards world Jewish groups after Delamuraz ' s comments , which outraged many Jews . Stock market traders attributed a decline in Swiss bank shares on Monday to talk of a boycott of banks that leading Jewish groups will consider in early February . Switzerland ' s two biggest newspapers , the conservative Blick and liberal Tages - Anzeiger , both urged the government in editorials to make a reconciliatory gesture . Berne ' s top official for handling the issue of Holocaust accounts said the government expected to decide by the end of January whether to create a memorial fund . " The banks have already been contacted about this issue , " said Thomas Borer , special ambassador in charge of a task force coordinating government policy on the controversy . The Swiss Bankers Association hailed the proposal for talks . But it said a joint commission of Jewish groups and Swiss banks headed by former U . S . central bank chief Paul Volcker should first rule on how much of the money stemmed from Jews killed in the Holocaust - - a conclusion expected in mid - 1998 . Some 40 million Swiss francs has been found in a sweep of dormant pre - 1945 accounts by Swiss banks , under pressure from the World Jewish Congress and U . S . Senator Alfonse D ' Amato to prove they were not hoarding wealth left by Holocaust victims . Bankers say not all those accounts belonged to victims of the Nazis and efforts to match the funds with claims from heirs had traced only 11 , 000 Swiss francs to Jewish owners as of last November . The bankers association also said no money could be used for a fund until all valid claims by heirs or others had been ruled out for each account . " The legal rights of individuals must be guaranteed , " association spokesman Silvia Matile told Reuters . ( $ 1 = 1 . 3555 Swiss Franc )

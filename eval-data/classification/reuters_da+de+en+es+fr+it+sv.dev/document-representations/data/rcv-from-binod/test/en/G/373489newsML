Oklahoma City bomb courtroom renovated for $ 580 , 000 . The renovation of the federal courthouse in Denver where the Oklahoma City bombing trial will be held has set the taxpayers back some $ 580 , 00 , federal officials said on Tuesday . The five - month renovation programme included costs to install equipment for a closed - circuit telecast of the trial to victims in Oklahoma City . The telecast was mandated by a clause in last year ' s anti - terrorism bill after the trial was moved to Denver to insure a fairer hearing . Victims unable to travel to Denver will be able to watch the proceedings at a Federal Aviation Administration ' s training centre in Oklahoma City . Local Oklahoma media will not be allowed to watch the telecast . Timothy McVeigh , 28 , and Terry Nichols , 41 , are accused in the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P . Murrah federal building that claimed the lives of 168 people . McVeigh will be tried first on March 31 . Nichols ' trial will be held at a later undetermined date . They face the death penalty , if convicted . The renovation is a joint effort of the Administrative Office of the Federal Courts in Washington , the FAA , the General Services Administration and the U . S . Marshals Service , according to James Manspeaker , spokesman for the trial judge Richard Matsch . The Administrative office of the U . S . Courts provided $ 380 , 000 and the GSA supplied $ 200 , 000 .

J . P . Morgan net fell 23 percent in 3rd quarter . J . P . Morgan & Co . Inc . said Thursday its earnings fell 23 percent in the third quarter , hurt by a one - time charge and a drop in income from stock market investments . The results were below expectations on Wall Street and Morgan stock fell , though modestly . Even without the $ 71 million charge for a previously announced technology alliance , net income would have still been 12 percent below that of the 1995 quarter , the nation ' s fourth - largest bank said . Industry analysts said sluggish stock and bond markets in the quarter hurt results at Morgan , which is more like an investment bank than most of its commercial bank competitors . However , some noted that the latest results offered convincing evidence that the firm was now a power among investment banks , with strong performance in underwriting and mergers and acquisitions advisory work . " It ' s phenomenal , " said George Salem , analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison . " They ' ve come from way down to being No . 4 in underwriting in the U . S . " For the third quarter of 1996 , Securities Data Co . ranked J . P . Morgan as the fourth - largest underwriter of U . S . debt and equity issues , serving as lead manager on $ 19 . 2 billion in deals in the quarter . Securities Data also had J . P . Morgan ranked sixth in completed deals worldwide and fourth in pending transactions in the first nine months of 1996 . " Investment banking continues to show strong headway , " said Salomon Brothers analyst Diane Glossman . " Year - to - date performance is well ahead of last year , although third - quarter results did not achieve the levels of the first two quarters , " Chairman Douglas Warner III said in a statement . Earnings for the first nine months rose 24 percent . The New York - based bank said net income fell to $ 276 million , or $ 1 . 32 a share , in the quarter ended Sept . 30 , from $ 360 million , or $ 1 . 78 a share , in the 1995 period . Revenues were flat at $ 1 . 55 billion . Analysts had expected Morgan to earn $ 1 . 58 a share in the quarter , according to First Call , which tracks Wall Street earnings estimates . Excluding the charge , equal to 21 cents a share , Morgan ' s per share earnings of $ 1 . 53 were still below expectations . Morgan ' s stock fell 12 . 5 cents to $ 85 . 875 on the New York Stock Exchange . While third - quarter results excluding the charge were below expectations , Morgan ' s " underlying results weren ' t so bad , " said Raphael Soifer , analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman . He noted that the bank ' s investment banking revenues , up 19 percent to $ 233 million , set a record for Morgan . " Trading was down ( from the first two quarters ) but that was to be expected given the markets , " he said , referring to the stock and bond markets in the third quarter . Trading revenue rose 28 percent to $ 510 million due to higher results in fixed income and foreign exchange , while investment management fees grew 9 percent , Morgan said . Interest revenue fell 16 percent to $ 425 million . Other revenue fell 52 percent to $ 69 million . Included were net gains on stock investments of $ 56 million vs . $ 91 million in the 1995 period . Operating expenses grew 11 percent to $ 1 . 14 billion in the quarter , Morgan said . For the nine months , earnings including the special charge rose to $ 1 . 16 billion , or $ 5 . 60 a share , from $ 930 million , or $ 4 . 62 a share , in the year - earlier period . The firm is advising Gillette Co . on its planned $ 7 billion acquisition of Duracell International Inc . It is also advising American Home Products Corp . on the sale of an 80 percent stake in its food products unit , and is adviser to Service Corp . International in its hostile bid for Loewen Group Inc .

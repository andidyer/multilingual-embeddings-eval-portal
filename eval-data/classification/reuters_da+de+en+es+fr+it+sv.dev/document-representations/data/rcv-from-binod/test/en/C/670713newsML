FOCUS - Olivetti to stay in the red for 1997 . Italy ' s Olivetti will stay in the red for the seventh consecutive year this year , the group said on Wednesday , as improvements in its information technology sector fail to offset losses from telecom operations . Group chief executive Roberto Colaninno told Olivetti ' s annual shareholders meeting in its home town of Ivrea , near Turin in northwest Italy , 1997 would see a recovery in profitability at its information technology interests . Olsy ( Olivetti Solutions ) , which makes computer systems for banks and retailers would see " positive results . " Lexikon , which makes printers , copiers and faxes and Tecnost , a 48 percent - owned specialist information systems group , will also be positive . But Olivetti ' s telecoms interests , Telemedia and its 35 . 5 - percent stake in mobile phone consortium Omnitel , would sustain losses in 1997 . But these losses were in line with budget . " The positive effects from the results in information technology will not be sufficient to completely cover the losses of the telecoms companies and the costs of the holding company , " he told Olivetti ' s shareholders . " We anticipate a consolidated result that therefore , represents an important progress towards a return to conditions of economic equilibrium , " Colaninno added . But he still forecast the group would get as close as possible to breakeven before Omnitel losses and tax payments . Olivetti has not reported a profit since 1990 and sunk to a net loss of 915 billion lire ( $ 540 million ) in 1996 after a record 1 . 60 - trillion lire loss in 1995 as it tried to focus on telecoms and IT and away from personal computers . The shareholders meeting was the first in nearly two decades without former chairman Carlo De Benedetti , who bowed out last September after he failed to turn a profit . Last year , Olivetti lost four other top managers in a board room bloodbath , and chairman Antonio Tesone told shareholders on Wednesday the debacle cost the group 14 to 15 billion lire . Colaninno was then brought in to start his own rescue plan and on Wednesday , he repeated a forecast made last month that Olivetti sales would reach nine trillion lire in 1997 after 8 . 3 trillion in 1996 , with seven trillion coming from IT companies and 25 percent , or two trillion , from telecoms . Colaninno said in May he expected Olivetti in the first half of 1997 to make a pretax loss , before Omnitel losses , of 264 . 2 billion against a 350 . 2 billion loss in the first half of 1996 . Colaninno confirmed Omnitel is scheduled to break even in 1998 after starting its mobile phone service in December 1995 . He added talks were continuing with France Telecom and Bell Atlantic over Infostrada , the venture which plans to start Italy ' s second fixed - line telecoms national network . But Colaninno declined to say if Bell was planning to pull out of Infostrada as some newspaper reports have suggested . France Telecom said in April it was buying a 49 percent of Infostrada , while Olivetti and Bell ' s 67 - and 33 - percent stakes , respectively , would be diluted as their portions become stakes in a holding company that owns 51 percent of Infostrada . Shareholders also approved a capital reduction to cut the number of Olivetti shares in issue , after the holding company Olivetti SpA announced a 1996 net loss of 1 . 4 trillion lire . Olivetti shareholders will swap 25 old Olivetti shares for 16 new ones in a move to comply with Italian regulations , which say that if a holding company has losses greater than a third of its total capital , it must reduce its capital . Olivetti chairman Antonio Tesone also announced group vice chairman Giorgio Garuzzo ' s resignation . Garuzzo joined the group from industrial group Fiat in March last year . Olivetti shares closed down 0 . 6 percent at 462 . 5 lire . $ 1 = 1 , 696 lire

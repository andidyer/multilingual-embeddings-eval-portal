CRICKET - KUMBLE STRIKES AS INDIA MAKE INROADS . Leg - spinner Anil Kumble struck with his first delivery as India made inroads into South Africa ' s top order batting on the third morning of the third and final test on Saturday . South Africa slipped to 73 for three but recovered to 125 for three at lunch in reply to India ' s first innings of 410 . After South Africa ' s opening pair had made a bright start against the seam of Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad , Kumble broke through . Kumble found the edge of Andrew Hudson ' s bat in the 10th over and Mohammad Azharuddin held a good catch at first slip . Hudson made 18 . Adam Bacher hit three boundaries in scoring 13 and was then adjudged lbw by English umpire Peter Willey . Bacher played no shot to a Srinath in - swinger which looked as if it may have gone over the top of off - stump . The vital wicket of in - form opener Gary Kirsten fell two overs later when the left hander chose the wrong ball to leave alone and had his off - stump ripped out by Venkatesh Prasad when he had made 29 . South Africa were then 73 for three but fourth wicket pair Daryll Cullinan and Hansie Cronje responded to the situation with a string of high quality boundaries . At lunch , Cronje was 28 with Cullinan 29 , the pair having added 52 in an unbroken stand . South Africa have a 2 - 0 winning lead in the series .

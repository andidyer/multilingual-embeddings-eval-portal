Proton says so far no impact from yen . Profits of Malaysian carmaker Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd ( Proton ) have so far not been affected by the surge in the yen , Proton ' s chairman Saleh Sulong said on Tuesday . He said the company was hedged in its exposure to the Japanese currency through forward purchases of the yen . " At this time we would like to assure everyone that we are covered because we buy forward ( on the yen ) , " he told Reuters in an interview following a company function . " But if it ( the yen ) goes on ( rising against ringgit ) for longer , we cannot say , " Saleh added . " The question is whether it is going higher in the short - term or stabilise . I hope it stabilises , " said Saleh , who is also group chairman of Proton ' s parent firms Diversified Resources Bhd and Hicom Holdings Bhd . He did not disclose the amount of forward purchases on the yen by Proton . A rise in the yen had triggered a selloff in automotive stocks this week on worries the stronger currency would increase the costs of car parts imported from Japan . A large proportion of Malaysia ' s car components are sourced from Japan . The yen has appreciated around six percent against the ringgit over the last week .

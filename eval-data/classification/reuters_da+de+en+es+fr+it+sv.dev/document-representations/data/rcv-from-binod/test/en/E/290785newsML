Brazil minister sees no rise in import tariffs . Brazilian Industry and Commerce Minister Francisco Dornelles on Tuesday reiterated government assurances that tariffs on imports will not be raised . " We will not change our tariff structure , " he said , denying news reports that the ministry had prepared a study recommending tariff increases for certain key but beleaguered industrial sectors . Dornelles added as part of Mercosur and its Common External Tariff policy , Brazil " cannot act unilaterally " . Mercosur groups Argentina , Uruguay and Paraguay in addition to Brazil . Dornelles has taken on the mantle of hero to domestic industry and has presided over controversial safeguard measures , such as higher tariffs for toys and quotas for textile imports . He stressed Brazil ' s trade liberalization was " irreversible " . On Monday , secretary of industrial policy Antonio Sergio Martins de Mello told Reuters the ministry had prepared a report suggesting special aid , such as cheap credit , for 15 industrial sectors to help them cope with foreign competition . Mello stressed the government considered that boosting Brazilian competitiveness by restructuring industry was the best way of countering rising imports and boosting exports to plug the country ' s burgeoning trade deficit . Dornelles said on Tuesday the government was making great efforts to increase exports and reduce the cost of doing business in Brazil .

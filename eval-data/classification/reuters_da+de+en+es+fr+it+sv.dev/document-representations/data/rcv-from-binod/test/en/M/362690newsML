Dollar , stocks soar after benign U . S . data . The dollar and stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic soared on Friday after benign U . S . jobs and earnings data calmed worries about American inflation and a possible rise in interest rates . The dollar climbed to its highest level against the mark , yen and Swiss franc in years . At least nine European bourses , including the biggest markets of London , Paris and Frankfurt , struck new records . In contrast , gold prices fell to their lowest fixing price in almost four years as the bearish mood that has prevailed in the gold market for several months deepened . Bullion closed in London at $ 340 . 45 , down $ 2 . 80 . Wall Street stormed ahead in morning trade , taking its cue from buoyant bond markets , which rallied after the U . S . Labour Department released January non - farm payrolls figures that showed an unexpected rise . By 1700 GMT the Dow Industrials was up 72 points but off its highs . Although the jobs data was distorted by seasonal factors and harsh winter weather , economists seized on weakness in other parts of the report to predict the Federal Reserve would continue to hold rates steady in the coming months . " The figures will give a lot of relief to the bond market and I think also stocks , " one London analyst said . Financial markets , attuned to hints of stronger inflation , had anxiously awaited the report for signs of whether the U . S . jobs market was tightening enough for employers to bid up wages , which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates . The dollar rallied to its highest level against the mark and Swiss franc in almost three years and its highest level on the yen in four years , spurred on by the favourable U . S . data . The U . S . curency earlier opened strongly in Europe on the expectation that the world ' s main industrialised nations would not try to shoot it down at this weekend ' s meeting in Berlin of Group of Seven ( G7 ) finance ministers and central bank governors . It then set fresh highs at 1 . 6755 marks , 1 . 4460 Swiss francs and 124 . 72 yen . " The dollar rise is really derived from a bit of everything - - the payrolls data , the bond rally and the G7 meeting , " said Teis Knuthsen , economist at First Chicago . " The asset market rally has been a particular driving force today . German and British government bonds leapt with U . S . treasuries following the U . S . data , which traders called the best of both worlds . Equity markets , already bolstered by Wall Street ' s recovery on Thursday , rallied higher still after the jobs news . London ' s FTSE 100 index climbed up into record territory through the afternoon , closing above the key 4 , 300 point for the first time at 4 , 307 . 8 . It ended just short of its trading record but still up nearly one percent . Kirit Shah , a strategist at Sanwa International in London , said he believed the FTSE 100 could test the 4 , 400 - 4 , 450 level over the next few months as investors anticipate steady interest rates in both the U . S . and Britain . " As long as the market ' s attention is on low interest rates , equities will rally from here , " Shah said . " But the market could be in for a nasty shock next quarter if the strong dollar has an impact on earnings . " French stocks hit a record trading high of 2 , 597 . 85 points on the CAC - 40 index before ending at a closing peak of 2 , 597 . 52 , a rise of 1 . 53 percent on the day . " You just can ' t go against a market for which people want to pay , " said Olivier Blitz at IFF . Havas AGHP . PA , suspended on Thursday , closed down 3 . 7 percent at 432 . 3 francs . Generale des Eaux EAUG . PA , also suspended on Thursday , ended up nearly six percent at 775 francs . The companies announced on Thursday that CGE would become the majority shareholder of Havas with 30 percent , and Havas would become the leading shareholder in Canal Plus with 34 . 4 percent as part of a restructuring of their media activities . Like the rest of Europe , German shares surged to new bourse and electronic trade records . The 30 - share DAX index ended bourse trade over one percent higher at 3 , 138 . 01 points , up 33 . 87 . Floor trade ended before the U . S . data were released but the electronic market reacted strongly to the figures and the rise in the dollar . The IBIS DAX index continued its record - breaking run to close at 3 , 161 . 36 points , up 36 . 58 with no bearish signs in sight to halt its advance . " Just look at the dollar - we ' ve been through 1 . 67 marks and are now above that , U . S . non - farm payroll data was good and Wall Street is up - - a classic bull market , " said one trader . CURRENCIES AT 1700 GMTThe dollar was quoted at 1 . 6742 marks and 124 . 69 yen compared with 1 . 6514 marks and 123 . 70 yen in late European trading on Thursday .

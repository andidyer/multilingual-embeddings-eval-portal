London gold fixes lower as sellers step in . Precious metals prices drifted lower on Friday afternoon reflecting the lack of followthrough to silver ' s bounce on Thursday and the increasing predominance of gold sale offers , dealers said . " It would all get a lot more interesting if gold could pick up a bit but it can ' t , " one dealer said . Gold was fixed at $ 380 . 75 per ounce after $ 381 . 85 this morning and $ 381 . 75 on Thursday afternoon . At the fixing Comex December was down $ 1 . 40 at $ 383 . 10 having been forecast to open unchanged to down 50 cents from Thursday ' s close of $ 384 . 50 . Gold hit an overnight high of $ 382 . 80 an ounce , the top level in two weeks . But selling pressure , which some dealers attributed to Australian gold miners , had pushed it back under the sticky $ 382 level by the time European trading started . " We were hearing about quite high volumes , " one dealer said , adding the selling interest was particularly apparent between $ 382 - $ 383 . Around the fix gold drifted to around $ 381 . 00 on light waves of selling but dealers said the market had turned quiet . " It ' s pretty disappointing , " one said . The markets paid little to September U . S . Producer Price Index ( PPI ) data which rose 0 . 2 percent against a 0 . 3 percent rise in August . Gold had shed about 30 cents after the data to add to losses from Thurday ' s closing level . Economists had forecast a rise of 0 . 3 percent in the core rate . September retail sales were up 0 . 7 percent against forecasts of a 0 . 2 - percent rise overall . Dealers said gold would probably continue to drift down to the lower end of its $ 380 - $ 383 price range . They largely dismissed the Comex option expiry after close of business as a market factor . Silver was also drifting lower and losing sight of Thursday ' s high at around $ 5 . 08 . " We ' re not going to see anything above that today . It ' s more likely to drift down towards $ 4 . 98 , " one dealer said . He added that the gold market ' s inability to get the price moving had turned sentiment from mildly bullish on Thursday to bearish across the complex . Platinum lost more than the rest of the complex , being indicated at $ 385 . 50 / $ 386 . 50 , down from a close on Thursday of $ 388 . 25 / $ 389 . 25 while palladium was unchanged at $ 116 . 75 / $ 117 . 75 . - - Brian Spoors London nesroom + 44 171 542 8058

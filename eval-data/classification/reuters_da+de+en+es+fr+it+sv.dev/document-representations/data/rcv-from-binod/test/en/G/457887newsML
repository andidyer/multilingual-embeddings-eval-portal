Australian euthanasia widow appeals for law to stay . The widow of the first person to die under Australia ' s unique voluntary euthanasia law appealed to politicians on Thursday not to overturn " the most compassionate piece of legislation in the whole world " . Judy Dent , whose husband Bob died in September after a computer - delivered lethal injection , said senators debating the law should put personal feelings and heed the views of the vast majority of Australians who support euthanasia . Senate , the upper house of the national parliament , is debating a bill introduced by backbencher Kevin Andrews that would kill off euthanasia legislation which came into operation in the outback Northern Territory last July . The bill has already passed through the lower house of parliament and senators are expected to approve it in a conscience vote later this week or early next week . " I ' ve decided to speak now because I ' m afraid that the Senate is going to vote in favour of the Andrews bill , which will wipe out the most compassionate piece of legislation in the whole world , " Dent told Australian radio . " If they ( senators ) have personal opinions that make it difficult for them , let them abstain or let them say ' I personally am against voluntary euthanasia , however , my constituents have overwhelmingly told me that I must vote down Kevin Andrews ' bill ' . " Andrews is a leading member of a Christian morals faction within Prime Minister John Howard ' s Liberal Party . Under Australia ' s constitution , the national parliament can override territory legislation , but not state laws . Despite opposition from major political leaders , church , Aboriginal and medical groups , the Northern Territory ' s Rights of the Terminally Ill Act has wide public support with polls showing 75 percent of Australians back the right to die . Four people have so far used the bill to take their own lives , the first of them Dent , a 66 - year - old cancer patient who said he had lived too long on " a roller - coaster of pain " . At least two other Australians are preparing to use the law .

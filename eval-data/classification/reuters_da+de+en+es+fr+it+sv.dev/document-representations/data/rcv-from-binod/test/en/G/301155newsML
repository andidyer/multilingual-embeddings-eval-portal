Rebels execute cattle thief in the Philippines . A Moslem guerrilla firing squad executed a cattle thief in the southern Philippines , rebels said on Saturday . The 28 - year old victim , identified as Sonior Lusteros , was killed by an 11 - man firing squad inside a Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) camp in Munai town in Lanao del Norte , the MILF spokesman told reporters . A local reporter who witnessed the execution said it took place on the same spot where three men were shot to death by the rebel group last Wednesday after they were found guilty of killing an MILF member and stealing his car . The rebels said they caught Lusteros after local residents complained that he had been stealing their buffaloes , horses , and other domestic animals since 1989 . Police declined to comment on the executions conducted by the rebels . The MILF , a breakaway insurgent group fighting for an Islamic state in the southern Mindanao region , is holding peace talks with the government . The mainstream Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) signed a peace agreement with Manila last October , ending a 24 - year MNLF - led revolt for Moslem autonomy in the southern islands .

SOCCER - JUVENTUS FACE INTER AT TOP OF SERIES A . Italian league leaders and European champions Juventus travel to Milan for a potentially decisive clash with second placed Internazionale on Sunday . Juventus enter the game seven points clear of Inter and an away win would kill off their opponents ' title challenge , Juventus coach Marcello Lippi said . " If we win we ' ll be 10 points clear of Inter and will eliminate them definitively from the title race , " he said . " If we lose , then the championship is reopened , if we draw nothing changes . " Both sides enjoyed satisfactory midweek European performances , with Juventus drawing 1 - 1 at Norwegian side Rosenborg in the Champions ' League and Inter recording the same score at Belgian side Anderlecht in the UEFA Cup . Given that the second placed side in serie A also qualify for next year ' s Champions ' League , the clash with Juventus assumes added importance for Inter who are joint second with Parma , their next league opponent in eight days time . " Juventus will be under more pressure than us " , Inter ' s French midfield ace Youri Djorkaeff said . " They could put the title up for grabs again by losing while , even if we lose , the damage is relative because in the battle for second place our direct clash next week against Parma will be more important . " Inter striker Maurizio Ganz , scorer of goals against Piacenza and Anderlecht in his last two outings , is optimistic . " We ' re coming to the key moment of the season in great athletic condition and with our morale high . " They are a complete side , strong in every department and seasoned campaigners . But in Brussels I saw an Inter with a new attitude , I sense that this time we won ' t disappoint " . Inter ' s English coach Roy Hodgson must decide between an attacking formation which see Ganz and Chilean Ivan Zamorano play in front of Djorkaeff or a more cautious line out with Djorkaeff and Zamorano the only strikers . With English midfielder Paul Ince suspended , Hodgson seems likely to opt for the three man attack with Argentine Javier Zanetti , Swiss Ciriaco Sforza and Salvatore Fresi supporting Djorkaeff in midfield . Juventus strikers Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic are both still out through injury leaving Lippi little option but to field the attack which started against Rosenborg , namely Michele Padovano and Christian Vieri . Frenchmen Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps will be partnered by Angelo Di Livio and Yugoslav Vladimir Jugovic in midfield . Coach Lippi , keen to reject media criticism that Juventus were below their best against Rosenborg , expects a difficult match against Inter . " Of course , it ' ll be tough at the San Siro but everybody knows that there are no longer easy games , no matter what the competition , cup or league " . Sunday ' s clash will be the fourth between the two sides this season . Inter pulled off one of the surprises of the year when they eliminated Juventus from the two - legged Italian Cup , winning 3 - 0 in Turin and drawing 1 - 1 in Milan . That win partly compensated Inter for an earlier comprehensive 2 - 0 defeat when the sides met in the league in Turin last October .

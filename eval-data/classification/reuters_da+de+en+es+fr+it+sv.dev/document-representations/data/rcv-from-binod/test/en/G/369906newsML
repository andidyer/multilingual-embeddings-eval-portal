Home of accused French war criminal broken into . A house belonging to accused French Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon , who is due to stand trial for crimes against humanity , has been broken into , police sources said on Tuesday . They said investigators found no reason to link the break - in in the Paris suburb of Pontault - Combault , to a court case in which Papon is accused of organising the deportation of 1 , 560 Jews to Nazi death camps . They said the house had been vandalised and an investigation was under way to establish if anything was stolen . The Supreme Court last month ordered Papon , 86 , to face an assize court for his wartime activities , quashing his last - ditch attempt to avoid trial after 16 years of legal wrangling . Papon was secretary - general of the southwestern Bordeaux region under German occupation during World War Two . He enjoyed a brilliant post - war career as Paris police chief from 1968 to 1974 and budget minister in the 1970s before his wartime record became known . He denies the charges and says he remained at his job on orders of the Resistance .

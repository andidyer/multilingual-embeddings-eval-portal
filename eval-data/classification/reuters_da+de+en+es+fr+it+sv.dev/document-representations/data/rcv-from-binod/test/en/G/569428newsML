Key suspect confesses all in Vietnam drugs trial . A key defendant at a high - profile drugs trial in Vietnam pleaded guilty on Thursday and blamed a state official for his earlier not - guilty plea , Voice of Vietnam radio said . Dao Xuan Xe , a driver accused with 21 police officers , border guards and others , retracted a denial that he had received 60 cakes of heroin from a Laotian national , state radio said on the sixth day of the trial . Xe named an official in the Interior Ministry ' s Economic Police Department who , he alleged , told him to deny all charges levelled against him in the Hanoi People ' s Court . He also said that fellow defendant Vu Xuan Truong , a former captain in the ministry ' s anti - crime unit , brought a batch of heroin back to Hanoi after a ceremony to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1954 rout of French forces near the border with Laos . Truong is accused of playing a key role in the syndicate , which is believed to have flooded the country with more than 300 kg ( 660 pounds ) of heroin from Thailand , Laos and Burma over several years . Truong has admitted his involvement in the ring and said he expects to face the firing squad . He has offered to name some " very important people " during the hearing in return for the lives of his wife and brother - - who are also on trial - - being spared . Newspaper reports about the closed - door trial said Truong had twice tried to commit suicide by dashing his head , first against the wall of a prison cell and then against the corner of a water tank as he was being led from the court back to jail . He was reported to have become very weak , unable to stand during Wednesday ' s proceedings and whispered his testimony to the court . Newspapers said Xe had also tried to kill himself by ramming the handle of a toothbrush into his ear . Two police captains and a lieutenant - colonel , all of them from the border province of Lai Chau , have been arrested in connection with the drugs ring in the past week . At least 18 other people , against whom evidence is still being compiled , are expected to stand trial at a later date . The court ' s presiding judge has said that more than 10 of the 22 currently on trial may be sentenced to death when the trial ends early next week .

Paper cites letter from missing Iranian . A German newspaper reported on Wednesday it had obtained a smuggled letter in which an Iranian journalist , who was reported missing in November after failing to arrive from Tehran , said he had been held by Iran ' s secret service . The Tageszeitung , in a release ahead of publication on Thursday , said the letter from journalist Faraj Sarkuhi explained how the secret service forced him to pretend he had flown to Germany while he was in fact in detention . After human rights groups expressed concern that Sarkuhi had failed to arrive on his flight to Germany , Tehran media said Iran Air records showed he had in fact landed . But the German Foreign Ministry said at the time it believed Sarkuhi was still in Iran , and former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr said Sarkuhi , editor of the monthly Adineh ( Friday ) , had never left Iran and was being interrogated by the secret service . Sarkuhi " reappeared " at Tehran airport on December 20 , more than a month after he was supposed to have boarded a flight to Germany there . He told a news conference he had been in Germany but had kept his visit a secret for personal reasons . Foreign - based opposition groups say the news conference was stage - managed by Iranian authorities . They also say Sarkuhi has once again been detained . He was arrested in Iran on Monday and is now being held by the authorities there , the groups say . According to Sarkuhi ' s letter , the Iranian secret service tried to force him to work with them , the Tageszeitung said . The letter said another Iranian was sent to Germany with Sarkuhi ' s passport to have it stamped as proof of his visit . The Tageszeitung also said it had information that Sarkuhi ' s mother had been told on Monday that the secret service had also arrested his brother . Sarkuhi ' s wife Farideh Zebarjad has received political asylum in Germany . She said in December that her husband was one of a group of Iranian writers who were detained in July when Iranian security forces forced their way into the private apartment of the German cultural attache in Tehran . She said they had been accused of spying for Germany and threatened with the death penalty . Zebarjad said she feared her husband was being held as a bargaining chip in the case of four Lebanese and an Iranian being tried in Berlin on suspicion of assassinating Iranian dissidents . Prosecutors have angered Iran by saying Tehran ordered the killings , an accusation it denies .

RTRS - NZ warns on Australian car tariff cut freeze . New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Don McKinnon said on Thursday a proposed freeze on tariff cuts to protect the Australian car industry could put at risk multilateral trade in the Asia Pacific region . McKinnon said the whole point of the Asia Pacific Economic Co - operation ( APEC ) forum ' s tariff reduction programme was greater multilateral trade which was of enormous benefit to the region . " If one country decides to stop , others get nervous , domestic politics come to play and the whole process becomes then in doubt , " he told a news conference following bilateral talks with Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer . " So from time to time , as politicians , we just have to grit our teeth , and hope we can get through such a thing like this , " McKinnon said . South Australia state Premier John Olsen has called for a 10 year freeze on reductions in Australian car industry tariffs , as the federal government considers assistance arrangements to the industry beyond 2000 , when tariffs are due to be 15 percent . A draft report by the Productivity Commission has proposed further cutting tariffs to five percent by 2004 , prompting warnings that car manufacturers could pull out of Australia . " I am not about to get into a debate on Australian internal politics but certainly the signals ( a freeze ) would send would not be the kind of signals that would be in the overall interests of Australia or New Zealand or any others , " McKinnon said . " If New Zealand manufacturers said to the New Zealand government ' we would like to see a freeze on tariffs at their present level until we get through a certain period ' we are just sending a signal to all our trading partners throughout the world that we are opting out of the APEC process , " he said . Downer would not speculate on future tariff arrangements , saying the government would develop its position following a final Productivity Commission report in May and consultation with the industry and other interested parties . Australia had seen a very significant reduction in its overall level of protection in the past decade , but there had also been significant , albeit patchy , reductions in south east and north east Asia , he said . " We will be working very hard to ensure that other countries reduce their protections and we do not do this just on our own , " Downer said . - - Sydney Newsroom 61 - 2 9373 - 1800

Thirteen hurt in Tel Aviv blasts . Two bombs apparently planted by Arab guerrillas exploded in rubbish bins near Tel Aviv ' s central bus station on Thursday , wounding at least 13 people , Israeli security and hospital officials said . National Police Chief Assaf Hefetz said the bombs were packed with nails , pointing almost certainly to a guerrilla attack . A spokeswoman for Tel Aviv ' s Ichilov hospital said 10 people were hurt . The Magen David Adom ambulance service said three other wounded were taken to another hospital . None of the injured was in serious condition . The blasts came against the backdrop of U . S . - brokered talks between Israel and the PLO on self - rule for most of the West Bank town of Hebron . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosions . Moslem militant groups had vowed to avenge last week ' s shooting attack by an off - duty Israeli soldier in Hebron who wounded seven Palestinians . Palestinian militants last mounted a bombing campaign in the Jewish state in February and March last year when suicide bombers killed 59 people . Asked if police believed Arab guerrillas were responsible for Thursday ' s blasts , Police Minister Avigdor Kahalani told Israeli Army Radio : " That ' s what we think . " Kahalani said it appeared the bombs were planted in rubbish bins next to a cinema that screens sex movies . " There was a very strong explosion under the Central Cinema , in a snack bar . A few minutes later , there was another blast , " a witness told Israeli Army Radio . " It was a tremendous explosion . A sunflower seed seller was hurt . Police arrived five minutes later . As they were checking things , another bomb went off and a policeman was hurt , " said another witness . Police said the time interval and distance of about 10 metres between the spots where the bombs were placed were all hallmarks of a guerrilla attack . The site is a run - down area of Tel Aviv that serves as an outdoor annex of the city ' s main enclosed central bus station situated several blocks away . Shops were still open at the time of the blasts , at around 8 : 25 p . m . ( 1825 GMT ) .

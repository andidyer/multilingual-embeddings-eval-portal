Italian - Thai set to win subway deal - MRTA .

" We are in negotiations with Italian - Thai to clarify prices , and if necessary technical matters . I think yes , there is a very high potential that we will get an agreement with them , " Theerapong Attajarusit , managing director of the MRTA , told Reuters . The MRTA is the state agency responsible for development of the subway . Italian - Thai , Thailand ' s largest construction company has a 36 percent holding in the ION Consortium , which submitted the lowest bid of 29 . 9 billion baht to build the northern section of Bangkok ' s new subway . Japan ' s Obayashi Corporation Plc and Nishimatsu Construction Thailand , a subsidiary of Japan ' s Nishimatsu Construction Plc , are the other two consortium members . " According to what we have planned we should pass our conclusions to the cabinet in March , " Theerapong said . Italian - Thai ' s bid had passed all technical aspects of the bidding process , he added . The new section , which is just over 10 km long , contains nine stations and runs through Bangkok ' s northern suburbs from Huay Kwang , where it meets the southern section , to Bang Sue . A contract to build the southern section of the subway was awarded to a consortium headed by Thai construction firm Ch Karnchang last year . The subway is scheduled to be operational in 2002 .

International mediators gather for Zaire talks . Leading U . S . , South African and United Nations mediators gathered in Luanda on Friday to prepare for the first face - to - face peace talks between Zaire ' s President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila . South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki arrived on Thursday night , accompanied by South African Defence Minister Joe Modise and two other senior officials . He made no comment at the airport in the Angolan capital . Another late arrival was U . N . special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun . U . S . envoy Bill Richardson arrived earlier in the day . In the Zairean capital Kinshasa , diplomatic sources said South African officials had worked into the early hours on Friday to try to keep the planned peace talks on track . They said the South Africans were battling to ensure Kabila attended the talks with Mobutu later on Friday aboard a South African naval ship off the Congolese coast . The South Africans were alarmed when Kabila made an unscheduled return to his headquarters in the Zairean city of Lubumbashi on Thursday night instead of remaining in Luanda to board the SAS Outeniqua . Mobutu , who has lost control of more than three - quarters of Africa ' s third largest country , agreed earlier to attend the talks , boarding the ship from Congo , aides said . " We ' ve got to make this work . It is imperative that that man ( Kabila ) arrives in Luanda tomorrow morning as early as possible , " said one South African official . Lubumbashi , capital of Zaire ' s copper region of Shaba , is about 1 , 500 km ( 950 miles ) east of the Atlantic seaboard where the Outeniqua was heading for the much awaited encounter , made more urgent by the relentless rebel advance on Kinshasa . South African President Nelson Mandela has staked his own name to try to end the Zairean conflict . He was expected to arrive in the Congolese port of Pointe - Noire to meet Mobutu , who is suffering from cancer and insisted on the peace talks taking place close to home . Mandela said through a spokesman on Thursday the Mobutu - Kabila talks , which he would chair , would be held on Friday . Richardson was due to meet Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Friday morning . " We are urging a peaceful settlement of the situtation in Zaire . I look forward to a meeting between President Mobutu and Mr Kabila very soon , " Richardson said after talks at the Angolan Foreign Ministry on Thursday . Diplomatic sources in the region have reported concern that Angola , struggling to establish its own fragile peace process , could be sucked into Zaire ' s civil war with government forces backing the rebels and former UNITA rebels backing the Zairean government .

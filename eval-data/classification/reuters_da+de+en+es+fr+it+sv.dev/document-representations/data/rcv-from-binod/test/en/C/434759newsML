Shares of three Thai banks on Moody ' s review rise . Shares in three Thai commercial banks facing a possible ratings downgrade by Moody ' s Investors Service rose on Tuesday but brokers cautioned the shares could still be negtively affected if a downgrade was confirmed . At 0818 GMT , Bank of Ayudhya Plc was up 1 . 00 baht to 53 . 50 while Siam City Bank Plc gained 0 . 50 to 19 . 75 and Thai Military Bank Plc advanced 1 . 00 to 36 . 75 . Moody ' s Investor Services said on Monday it planned a review and possible downgrade of its ratings for those three banks . The review was prompted by Thailand ' s weakening financial fundamentals , declining property and stock market , it said . " Investors should adopt a wait - and - see attitude now and buy the three banks stocks when Moody ' s makes its formal announcement downgrading them . By that time prices of the three banks would become cheaper , " said Thaneit Khantigaroon of Ekachart Finance and Securities . Analysts said the three medium - sized banks looked very likely to be downgraded as Thailand ' s long - term sovereign credit rating was also under review by the rating agency . Two Moody ' s officials were in Bangkok last week to meet senior officials and review national economic data for a decision on the review which is expected in two months time . - - Bangkok newsroom ( 662 ) 652 - 0642

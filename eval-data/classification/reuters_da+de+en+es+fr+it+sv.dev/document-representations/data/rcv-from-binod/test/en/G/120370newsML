Hebron a city that divides Arab and Jew . The Israeli - occupied West Bank town of Hebron , revered by both Moslems and Jews as the burial place of Abraham , has become the symbol that divides them . More than a year after Israel agreed to hand it over to Palestinian self - rule , the city of 100 , 000 Palestinians and 400 Jews is still at the centre of intense talks on how to protect the Jewish settlers who moved into Hebron in 1979 . On Wednesday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat angrily rejected a new Israeli plan to divide Hebron into Arab and Jewish parts . In Cairo , Arafat waved the plan in the air and described it as more racist than apartheid South Africa . " This blows up the agreement , " he told reporters . Palestinians have viewed the long - promised army redeployment in the southern West Bank town as a test of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ' s commitment to peace accords the PLO signed with the previous Israeli government . The city has long been a flashpoint of violence between Arabs and Jews drawn to the tomb of the biblical patriarch Abraham , known in Arabic as al - Ibrahimi mosque . In 1994 , a settler from nearby Kiryat Arba massacred 29 Moslem worshippers kneeling in prayer at the mosque . Israelis recall that in 1929 , some 60 Jews were killed in a massacre by Arabs . A 1995 accord expanding Palestinian self - rule in the West Bank made Hebron an exception when it called for an Israeli army pullout from seven West Bank towns occupied since the 1967 Middle East war . The other six towns have been evacuated . But under Article Seven of the self - rule deal signed in Washington on September 28 , 1995 , Israel agreed to redeploy its troops from only parts of Hebron , handing over about 80 percent of the town to Palestinian self - rule . Israel agreed to let the Palestinian Authority deploy up to 400 policemen equipped with 20 vehicles and armed with 200 pistols and 100 rifles in the area marked on a map as H2 . The rest of the city , where about 400 settlers live and study in heavily guarded enclaves , would remain under Israeli security control . The Palestinian municipality of Hebron would provide services to both Arabs and Jews . The accord also provided for joint patrols by Israeli and Palestinian security forces in areas deemed necessary to security of both Arabs and Jews . Netanyahu has demanded changes to the 1995 accord that would give the Israeli army the right to return to PLO - ruled areas , control of highlands overlooking the town and a say in the administration . Arafat ' s Palestinian Authority has refused to renegotiate the self - rule deal , insisting that the accord provides enough security for Israelis .

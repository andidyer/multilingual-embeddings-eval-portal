TEPCO to shut reactor to check irregularities . Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc ( TEPCO ) said on Tuesday it will shut a 784 , 000 kw nuclear reactor at its Fukushima plant by early Wednesday morning to check an irregularity in water levels emitted by an air cooling and dehumidifying unit in the reactor container . The unit ' s water output had risen and this could mean that radioactive steam was seeping out of pipes in the vessel that houses the reactor , a company spokesman said . He added that even if a steam leak was the cause of the irregularity , it posed no danger of radiation leaking into the atmosphere as it would be confined to the sealed vessel . He said TEPCO would investigate the cause of the irregularity after shutting the reactor at 4 . 00 a . m . local time on Wednesday . He said it was unclear when the reactor , located in eastern Japan would resume operations .

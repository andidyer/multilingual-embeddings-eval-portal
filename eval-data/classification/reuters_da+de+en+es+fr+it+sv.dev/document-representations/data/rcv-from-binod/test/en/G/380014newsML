North Korea defector talks to take time . Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said on Friday Beijing needed more time to decide what to do about a top North Korean defector now in South Korea ' s Beijing embassy . Speaking in Singapore after a 50 - minute meeting with South Korean counterpart Yoo Chong - ha , Qian gave no indication of how much time Beijing required . But a South Korean official told Reuters the crisis was unlikely to be resolved before the two ministers left Singapore after a meeting of Asian and European foreign ministers on Saturday . " I don ' t think it ' s possible , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . " It was the beginning of a useful discussion , but now it goes into diplomatic channels in Seoul and Beijing , " he added . Chinese spokesman Guo Chong - li also said further talks between the two ministers in Singapore were unlikely . " So far , I haven ' t heard any plans for a next meeting , " he told reporters . Qian said the defection of North Korean official Hwang Jang - yop had suprised China . " This incident happened all of a sudden , so we need more time to investigate , " Qian told reporters after meeting Yoo . He urged both Koreas " to treat this matter with a cool and calm manner , to keep peace and stability " as Chinese police surrounded Seoul ' s embassy in Beijing . Some commentators have suggested that Pyongyang , deep in economic trouble and dealing with widespread hunger after disastrous floods , might react violently to the defection of a man ranked 24 in its heirarchy . Yoo told reporters the two sides would meet again , but did not say where or when . He said Friday ' s talks , which were scheduled to last 30 minutes , were " good " and added : " Meetings will continue . " Yoo had decided not to attend the Singapore conference after Hwang ' s defection , then changed his mind so he could meet Qian . The defection - - Pyongyang called it a kidnapping - - has dragged China into a heated row that has bred fears of renewed tension on the Korean peninsula and possibly a disastrous collapse of the North . U . S . officials said the defection was another sign of strains in the Stalinist North that were also reflected in food shortages and reduced military training . South Korea is urging China to allow Hwang , who it said walked into its Beijing embassy on Wednesday after arriving with an aide by taxi to claim political asylum , to go to Seoul . North Korea is demanding that China return Hwang , credited with devising Pyongyang ' s " juche " , or self - reliant , brand of socialism . That leaves Beijing the choice of offending its old socialist comrade or a new capitalist partner that is investing heavily in China ' s booming economy . North and South Korea are still technically at war with their 1950 - 53 conflict ending in a truce , not a peace treaty . " We did not know what happened to Mr Hwang in Beijing . We were totally in the dark beforehand , " Qian said . " We were not aware of his stopover in Beijing . He did not stay at any Chinese hotels or guesthouses . " Western diplomats in Beijing say they believe China has little choice but to respect Hwang ' s desire to defect . The stakes are high for Hwang , who holds the innermost secrets of North Korea ' s secretive government as an intimate of top leader Kim Jong - il . According to the accounts of previous defectors , North Koreans caught fleeing the country can expect summary execution , or a lifetime in a North Korean gulag . Families of defectors , according to a pilot who defected last year , are condemned to " a life of slavery " . U . S . Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon said there was no indication of heightened military alert along the border between the two Koreas over the incident .

Scientists find physical basis for schizophrenia . Scientists have found more evidence that schizophrenia has a physical basis , the weekly science magazine Nature reported . Japanese researchers said that by using advanced scanning technology known as positron emission tomography ( PET ) they had shown schizophrenics had significant deficiencies of a key brain receptor which affect peoples ' moods and other mental processes . Schizophrenia has long been thought to involve changes in the way dopamine , a chemical neurotransmitter which transmits impulses in the brain , affect these receptors . Basic research supporting this came from the fact that drugs effective in treating psychosis interacted with a key group , known as D2 , of these dopamine receptors . Attempts to find changes in the amount of D2 receptors in schizophrenics ' brains have been inconclusive . But the Japanese researchers , led by Yoshiro Okubo of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine , said their PET studies had shown significant deficiencies of similar receptors , known as D1 , in the brains of schizophrenic patients . " This reduction was related to the severity of the negative symtoms , for instance emotional withdrawal , " they wrote . The researchers said this suggests that drugs which target these D1 receptors may be helpful in treating the negative symtoms of schizophrenia , a mental disease frequently accompanied by delusions and retreat from social life . In an analysis of the research , Eric Nestler of the Yale School of Medicine said the research was part of a more sophisticated view of the illness which is gradually emerging . Now , he wrote , researchers will have to determine whether schizophrenia involved either the loss of cells transmitting nerve impulses , called neurons , in the outer part of the brain or sustained impairment in the activity of existing neurons . " Sophisticated neurobiological hypotheses of schizophrenia are now emerging which define the critical directions for future research , " Nestler said .

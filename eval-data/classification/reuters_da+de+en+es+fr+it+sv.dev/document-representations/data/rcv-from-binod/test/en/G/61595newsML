U . S . to go ahead with jet sale to Indonesia . The United States intends to go ahead with the sale of nine F - 16 fighter jets to Indonesia despite concerns over Jakarta ' s human rights record , two senior U . S . officials said on Wednesday . " Our relationship , as strong as it currently is , cannot reach its full potential until Indonesia improves its human rights performance , " Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said at a hearing of the Senate East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee . But Lord and Assistant Defence Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration believed sale of the jets was in the U . S . interest because it would support regional stability . " We remain convinced that this transfer is in the U . S . interest and should proceed , and that we intend to notify Congress of our intentions in January , " Lord said . " A regionally respected armed forces with credible defensive capabilities that trains and operates in a non - threatening manner is an important contributor to regional stability , " Campbell added . State Department officials said earlier this month they were delaying sale of the jets until the next session of Congress begins in January because of human rights concerns . Lord said he had expressed U . S . concerns about recent events in Indonesia , especially the July 27 riot at the headquarters of the opposition Indonesian Democrat Party , to government officials during a visit to Jakarta last week . " Our message has been clear . Judging by my trip , I believe it has been heard , " Lord said . " The ( human rights ) record , while not satisfactory , is not without some positive trends , " he added , citing limited freedoms for opposition parties and the press . He said Indonesia was pursuing constructive policies with its neighbours and cooperating with Washington on military matters . But Sidney Jones , executive director of Human Rights Watch / Asia , said Congress should block the sale of the jets because of what he called a government crackdown against opponents of President Suharto . " Congress should continue to oppose the sale of F - 16 fighter planes to Indonesia so long as the crackdown continues , " said Jones , who has just returned from Indonesia where he met with members of non - government organisations . " Many people in the pro - democracy movement suggested that more pressure , including economic pressure , was needed , " he said , adding that the United States and other countries should press for the release of all political detainees .

FOCUS - Dlr slumps to 7 - month low , Euro - bourses mixed . The dollar on Wednesday slumped to a seven - month low against the yen amid fears of rising trade tensions , while in European bourses dealings began mixed , unsettled by single currency uncertainties . London , Europe ' s biggest bourse , briefly touched a new trading record in early transactions on the back of a strong Wall Street close before losing its nerve and sliding into the minus column . Frankfurt and Paris , however , made healthy gains . Most of the early excitement was in currency markets where the dollar was hit by concerns that a burgeoning Japanese current account surplus would cause trade friction between Washington and Tokyo . The dollar fell to 110 . 70 yen in early trade , its weakest since November 18 , 1996 . It recovered slightly to 110 . 95 yen later but still well below 112 . 61 seen in late Europe yesterday . The U . S . currency also weakened against the mark . The new anxiety was triggered by U . S . Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers who said Japan should avoid running up external surpluses that would hurt global growth . His remarks came after a report showed Japan ' s current account surplus leapt 92 . 7 percent to 1 . 09 trillion yen ( $ 9 . 7 billion ) in April from a year earlier and its trade surplus surged 90 . 9 percent to 1 . 02 trillion yen . " The figures were pretty much in line with expectations but what hit the market was Summer ' s comments , " said Steve Hannah , the director of research at IBJ . " The U . S . seems to be stepping up the war of words and it looks like we are going to test the 110 ( yen ) levels . " An official at Japan ' s Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday that while the decline in Japan ' s trade and services surplus was slowing , the surplus was unlikely to rise significantly in the medium to longer term . This cut little ice with traders , who were keener to focus on Summers ' comments and remarks made on Tuesday by U . S . Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky , who said the recent trend in Japan ' s trade balance was " disturbing " . Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Eisuke Sakakibara , the director general of the Ministry ' s International Finance Bureau , said excessive yen strength or weakness was undesirable . Such comments are proving less and less supportive for the dollar , though , and it is expected to revisit the 110 - yen level it has managed to hold above since the end of September 1996 . " They keep saying they don ' t want excessive moves but the question is what are they going to do about it , " said David Coleman , the chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy . In equity markets , trading was mixed , with London , which closed at a new peak on Tuesday , especially volatile . Its benchmark FTSE 100 index shot higher into record ground at the start , touching 4759 . 3 points , buoyed by another solid performance on Wall Street and news of a possible bid for Energy Group Plc , dealers said . But the rally quickly ran out of steam . Stocks lost all their gains and had chalked up losses of 0 . 3 percent by mid - morning . The eary gains had been driven by a big surge in shares of Energy Group , which soared 76p , or more than 13 percent , to 656 after the UK electricity company late Tuesday said it was in talks with PacifiCorp of the U . S . which could lead to a recommended offer . Wall Street ' s performance on Tuesday also helped the initial climb . The Dow Jones industrials closed at 7 , 539 . 27 points , the third consecutive closing peak . In Frankfurt , stocks made modest gains , helped by the Wall Street gains but jitters about European monetary union may weigh on the advance , traders said . The market ' s EMU worries stemmed from doubt over France ' s questions about a stability pact to ensure budget discipline after the start of currency union . But such worries seemed to have receded in Paris where the bourse climbed over one percent . The advance was bolstered by gains in bond prices on indications , according to analysts , that the new French government will not hold up the stability pact , increasing the likelihood of a euro launch on time . Car giant Renault climbed 2 . 5 percent in early trade , recouping half the previous day ' s loss on concerns that the carmaker ' s decision to commission an independent study could delay its Vilvoorde plant closure .

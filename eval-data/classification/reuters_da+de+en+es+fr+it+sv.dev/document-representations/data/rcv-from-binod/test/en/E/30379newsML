U . S . NAPM ' s Kauffman sees little price pressures . U . S . purchasing managers see little price pressure and no real shortage in labor , despite increases in the National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index , a NAPM official said Tuesday . Ralph Kauffman , chairman of NAPM ' s business survey committee , told reporters on a teleconference that most purchasing managers said they were not seeing higher prices . " It appears that things are probably going to stay relatively calm in the price sector , " Kauffman said . " There were very few comments dealing with the experiences of increased prices . " He said that conditions " total up to not a whole lot of price pressures on manufacturers right now . " The NAPM index of manufacturing activity rose to 52 . 6 in August from 50 . 2 in July , while the prices component climbed to 47 . 4 from 44 . 5 and employment component rose to 48 . 2 from 45 . 5 . " Aside from the comments of a few members that they are experiencing some problems hiring highly trained or highly specialized persons , there just doesn ' t seem to be any real shortage of employment prospects to meet the current demand of emplyment in manufacturing , " Kauffman said , Kauffman noted that NAPM members have indicated over the past few months that they expect U . S . economic conditions to gradually get better . " They generally think things are going to continue to improve at a slow and steady rate , " he said . Kauffman also said he did not foresee " any tremendous or large increases in production " over the near term . - - N . A . Treasury Desk , 212 - 859 - 1660

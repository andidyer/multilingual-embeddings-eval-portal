Spain resumes talks with Marxist guerrillas GRAPO . The Spanish government has resumed talks with GRAPO Marxist guerrillas to negotiate the group ' s dissolution and stop its violent activities , an Interior Ministry spokesman said on Monday . The talks with jailed GRAPO leaders , which began in February under the previous Socialist administration , had been on hold during the transition to a conservative government . The spokesman confirmed that talks had resumed , but refused to comment on progress saying they needed to be conducted with the " maximum possible discretion . " Prison officials said the jailed members of GRAPO , the October First Anti - Fascist Resistance Group , were " sick of prison " and willing to negotiate . Some have been in prison for 20 years . They are looking to legalise GRAPO ' s political arm - - the outlawed Communist Party of Spain - Reconstituted ( PCE - R ) , a splinter group of the official and recognised Communist Party of Spain - - and to get the prisoners pardoned . Officials quoted in Spanish newspapers said there had been many contacts between military intelligence agents and the prisoners and the talks were going well . " There could be results , or even an accord , in days or weeks , " an unamed source from the Interior Ministry told daily newspaper El Pais . The main sticking point is a dispute over a businessman from Aragon , Publio Cordon , who was kidnapped on June 27 , 1995 . GRAPO says the group released him on August 17 , 1995 after the family paid a 390 billion peseta ( $ 3 billion ) ransom in Paris , where the outlawed PCE - R is based . The government and the family insist he is still being held . GRAPO was active mainly in the early years of Spain ' s transition to democracy in the late 1970s . It killed some 80 people in an effort to overthrow the Spanish government and establish a Marxist state . Most of its member are in jail but a small number still stage occasional shows of force . ( $ 1 = 129 . 82 pesetas )

Fujimori , who took office in 1990 and won re - election last year with an overwhelming 64 percent of the vote , has held relatively high popularity ratings during his term due primarily to the virtual defeat of communist guerrillas , economic reforms and strong , personalized leadership style . But his perceived authoritarianism and the administration ' s failure to reduce high levels of poverty and unemployment is starting to take its toll on Fujimori ' s popularity , analysts say . - - Andrew Cawthorne , Lima newsroom , 511 221 - 2134

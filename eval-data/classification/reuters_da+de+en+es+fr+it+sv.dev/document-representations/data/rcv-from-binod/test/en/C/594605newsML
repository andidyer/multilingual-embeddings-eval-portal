BHP finalises Argentina copper study . Australia ' s Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd ( BHP ) will finish a preliminary feasibility study on its big Agua Rica copper study in Argentina by June , an official working on the project said Monday . BHP will not decide on a working idea of how big any mine at Agua Rica would be until the preliminary feasibility study is ready , but the project will be similar to the nearby $ 1 billion Bajo de la Alumbrera mine , the source said . " We are not sure exactly if it is a little bigger than Bajo de la Alumbrera or a little smaller , but it is comparable , " said the source , who asked not to be named . " Agua Rica has a bit more copper and definitely less gold than Alumbrera . It also has an interesting molybdenum component , " he said . Bajo de la Alumbrera , which is also in the northwestern province of Catamarca , is due to start up in August and is the largest mining project in Argentine history . Held 50 percent by Australia ' s MIM Holdings , 25 percent by Australia ' s North Ltd , and 25 percent by Canada ' s Rio Algom , Bajo de la Alumbrera will produce 190 , 000 tonnes of copper in concentrates a year , plus 730 , 000 ounces of gold . BHP has 70 percent of Agua Rica , and Canada ' s Northern Orion the rest . The ore type would mean that Agua Rica would produce concentrates like Bajo de la Alumbrera . " We plan to extract the ore , produce concentrate close to the mine and export the concentrates , " the source said . The most recent published figures for Agua Rica put the geological resource at 1 . 2 billion tonnes , graded at 0 . 5 percent copper . But the source said BHP is still not sure of exactly how big the mineable resource is . " There should be a better idea of the size of the resource by the end of this ( preliminary feasibility ) stage , " he said . While no final decision has been taken on spending at Agua Rica during Australia ' s 1997 / 98 financial year , the company will likely proceed quickly to the final feasibility study . " That ( the feasibility study ) wouldn ' t be finished before the end of 1998 , " the source said . Alumbrera president Peter Freund said in March that his firm had had preliminary talks with BHP over the possibility of sharing infrastructure . But the source said it was early days yet . " They were very early talks , because we still don ' t know exactly where our infrastructure would be installed , " he said . Agua Rica is located 16 miles ( 25 km ) north of the town of Andalgala at 10 , 600 feet ( 3 , 200 meters ) above sea - level . Work at the site is not made more difficult in winter , despite the altitude . BHP has still to find a supply of water at Agua Rica - - water is a vital component of concentrates - - but is about to start an exploration program with the aim of finding enough to work with by the end of next year . " There is no reason to suppose there won ' t be water , " the source said . ( ( - - Buenos Aires Newsroom + 541 318 - 0655 ) )

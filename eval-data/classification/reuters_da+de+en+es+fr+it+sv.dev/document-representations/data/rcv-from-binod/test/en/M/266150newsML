Dow soars 127 points , second - largest net gain ever . The Dow industrials surged to their second - best finish ever on Thursday , as a resurgent bond market and a flurry of options - related buy programs had many thinking Santa Claus had arrived on Wall Street . The Dow rose 127 points , or 2 . 00 percent , to close unofficially at 6474 in a powerful rally that saw 26 of the 30 Dow components close higher . " This may be the start of the Santa Claus rally , " said Richard Cripps , chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker . In the previous two sessions , stocks had managed to push higher despite an uncooperative bond market . That changed when a series of friendly economic reports , including a soft Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions survey and a surprising rise in new jobless claims . The pair helped produce a nearly 1 - 1 / 2 point rise in the 30 - year U . S . Treasury , pushing the yield down to 6 . 59 percent and further loosening the shackles on stocks . " The big surprise today was the decline in the Philly Fed survey , " said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany . " That was important because it was our first look at December numbers , and it told us the economy was slower than in November , " Johnson said . Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the session , noting Friday ' s triple - witching expiration of futures , options , and index options likely exaggerated the market ' s action . Of the three program trades on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday , all were on the buy side and contributed a total of nearly 27 Dow points , according to Birinyi Associates . While the rally was impressive , it fell far short of the Dow ' s 186 . 84 - point run on October 21 , 1987 , a climb that took the index more than 10 percent higher to 2027 . 85 . In fact , the session came nowhere near the top 10 on a percentage basis . Even so , there was plenty to cheer about . NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than two - to - one margin on very heavy volume that exceeded 500 million shares for the third straight day . The widespread buying interest also helped stocks overcome a profit warning from General Motors Corp , which early on threatened to cast a pall over the entire market . Several Wall Street firms slashed fourth - quarter estimates on GM after the company told analysts late Wednesday its earnings would be hurt by high costs associated with marketing a host of new models . " In the old days , what was bad for GM was bad for the country , " said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . " That certainly does not seem to be the case today . " Analysts appeared satisfied with GM ' s assertion that the earnings shortfall was a temporary phenomenon , leaving their 1997 estimates unchanged . GM shares fell 1 / 8 to 54 - 3 / 8 . In other individual issues , General Electric Co jumped 3 - 1 / 2 to 102 - 3 / 4 after announcing a 2 - for - 1 stock split , a 13 percent rise in its quarterly dividend to $ 0 . 52 per share and a $ 4 billion increase in its share repurchase program . Nike Inc climbed 1 - 7 / 8 to 60 - 3 / 4 , extending a rally triggered Wednesday when the company reported strong second - quarter earnings . Fila Holdings SpA joined in the rally , rising 4 - 7 / 8 to 64 - 3 / 4 . Micro Warehouse Inc slid 7 - 1 / 2 to 12 - 1 / 2 after warning fourth - quarter earnings would fall short of estimates . The company blamed increasing competition in its Macintosh sales business and higher operating costs . Another Macintosh retailer , Multiple Zones International Inc , also said its fourth - quarter earnings would be depressed because of margin pressures . Shares in Multiple Zones tumbled 7 - 3 / 4 to 10 - 1 / 2 . Shares in Apple Computer Inc , which makes the Macintosh computer line , fell 7 / 8 to 22 - 1 / 4 . The S & P 500 rose 14 . 22 to 745 . 76 . The Nasdaq Composite rose 10 . 48 to 1295 . 86 ( Figures official as of 1645 EST / 2145 GMT )

Greenspan favors some form of consumption tax . Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan Tuesday said he still favored some form of consumption tax and argued that the capital gains tax should be abolished since it is a poor way to raise revenues . In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee , Greenspan also said that he favored an economy with as strong growth as possible as long as it was sustainable . " I view the capital gains tax as a poor means of raising revenue in this country , " he said , adding " consequently I ' ve always argued that the appropriate capital gains tax was zero . " Short of that , he said that at least consideration should be given to the question of indexing capital gains . " I certainly think we should endeavor to create as much growth out of our economy as we can . . . so long as it is the type of growth which is sustainable , " he said . Greenspan said that it was conceivable that a cut in capital gains taxes could increase , rather than decrease , government tax revenue . That is because of the impact that such a move could have on economic growth .

Ofwat says to make initial cut in price limits . Britain ' s water industry regulator Ofwat will make an initial cut in price limits after the next pricing review in 1999 , Ofwat head Ian Byatt said on Monday . " This adjustment will further tilt the balance towards customers . I believe customers are gaining from efficiency , but it is necessary for both the regulator and the companies adequately to demonstrate this , " he told a business meeting in Liverpool , north west England . Similar step reductions in prices have already been proposed for other utility sectors but Byatt ' s comments are the first time such a move has been proposed for water companies . Ofwat said in October that it would review prices in 1999 , five years ahead of schedule . Byatt said on Monday that at the 1999 review , using current methodolgy , extra efficiency savings by companies would be shared out 55 percent to customers , 20 percent in taxation and 25 percent to shareholders . Byatt , speaking at Liverpool University , said that customers had already benefited from increased efficiency by companies . " Few people appreciate the extent to which customers have already benefitted from increased efficiency , " he said . He urged companies to satisfy their customers , adding that " the best way to please the regulator is to please the customers . " Industry regulators are increasingly taking a tough line on privatised utilities in the face of public outrage over hefty executive pay packets and high dividends . The opposition Labour party , widely expected to win the next general election which must be held by May 22 , has said it will review the regulatory system and may introduce boards of advisors . - - London Newsroom + 44171 542 7717

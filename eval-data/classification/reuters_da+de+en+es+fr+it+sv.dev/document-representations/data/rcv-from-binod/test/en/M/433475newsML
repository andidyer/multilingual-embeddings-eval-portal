Dollar up on comments on EMU , Japanese nuclear fire . The dollar edged higher on Tuesday , with the German mark pressured by positive comments on European monetary union , while a fire at a Japanese nuclear fuel processing plant weighed on the yen . In comments late on Monday , German Bundesbank council members insisted the single European currency , the Euro , should begin as planned on Jan . 1 , 1999 . The proposed single currency would unite the mark with weaker European currencies . Indications that the Euro will be launched on time tend to pressure the mark , since that would make the German currency less important . " What caused the mark to weaken was less fear in the market of a delay , " said Elliott Dix , an assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Signet Bank . " There was less fear in the market because of the comments from the Bundesbank officials . " The dollar climbed as high as 1 . 7079 marks and 122 . 06 yen in Europe before retreating . In late New York trading , the U . S . currency was at 1 . 7037 marks , up from 1 . 7015 marks late on Monday . The dollar rose to 121 . 78 Japanese yen from 121 . 63 yen . Bundesbank council member Guntram Palm said recent speculation about a possible delay to the debut of the single currency was " totally misplaced " and said he expects a majority of European Union countries to meet the entry criteria . Another council member , Ernst Welteke , said the Euro could take effect as planned in 1999 without weakening the membership criteria . To be included in the Euro , countries must slash their public deficits to around 3 . 0 percent of gross domestic product and reduce debt toward 60 percent . The qualification standards also require them to meet criteria on inflation , currency stability and long - term interest rates . The dollar initially fell against the yen in Asia after a government report showed that private - sector machinery orders in Japan jumped a robust 11 . 8 percent in January from December . The figures exclude orders for machinery at electric power firms and for ships . But the dollar rose against the yen in Europe after news that 10 workers at Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp . ' s Tokaimura plant located north of Tokyo were exposed to radiation when a small fire broke out on Tuesday morning . The fire was extinquished about 15 minutes later . Some traders also noted talk of a large purchase of dollars for yen by a bank during New York trading . In other trading , the British pound rose to $ 1 . 6075 from $ 1 . 6037 on Monday . The dollar fell to 1 . 4708 Swiss francs from 1 . 4715 francs and to Canadian $ 1 . 3673 from C $ 1 . 3713 .

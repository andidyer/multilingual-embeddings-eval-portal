Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Monday declined to comment on interest rates or currencies in remarks to the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan . Greenspan is in Tokyo for meetings with Japanese financial and monetary authorities . " The answer to that sort of question I usually do behind closed doors and make certain there are three locks on each door , " Greenspan said in response to a question about a possible " triple depreciation " of a drop in U . S . stocks , bonds , and currency . " I apologise , I ' m just really not able to respond to markets , interest rates and all related types of issues because I ' ve been taught by previous central bankers to be terribly cryptic , and when addressing such issues to be utterly incomprehensible . " Greenspan also declined to comment on currencies .

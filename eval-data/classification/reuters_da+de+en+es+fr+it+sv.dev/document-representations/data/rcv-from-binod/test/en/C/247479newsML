German truck and machinery maker MAN AG could cut its dividend in the 1996 / 97 business year which ends June 30 if its profit is poor , chairman Klaus Goette said on Tuesday . Goette , who is stepping down as chairman , said one should not assume that the dividend would be increased as a " good - bye " gift .

Goette said earlier in the day that he expected a good result this year , especially if the economy continues to expand .

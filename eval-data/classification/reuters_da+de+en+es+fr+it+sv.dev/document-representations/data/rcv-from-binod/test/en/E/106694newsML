Taiwan plans tax reform to boost investment . Taiwan ' s Finance Ministry announced a " two - into - one " tax merger on Wednesday to boost investment and a slowing economy . Finance Minister Paul Chiu said the ministry would merge the island ' s two income taxes into one business income tax of 25 percent . The merger would cut tax revenues by about T $ 26 . 8 billion ( US $ 975 million ) a year , but the ministry would recoup the loss by assessing a 10 percent levy on profits that enterprises reserve rather than distribute to shareholders immediately , Chiu said . " The new tax system will avoid double taxation and will help corporate structures , " Chiu told reporters . " In fact , this is a tax reduction , " Chiu said . " It will encourage investment ( in Taiwan ) and increase our international competitiveness . " Taiwan has been wooing multinationals to establish the island as a regional hub for Asia - Pacific operations by boosting local economic competitiveness . The tax reform needed parliamentary approval and could take effect in 1998 , the minister said . Foreign nationals ' taxes were not affected because their maximum rate would remain the same at 40 percent , Chiu said . What the ministry has called a " two - into - one " tax merger is an accounting change that eliminates double taxation of companies ' profits and the dividends they pay to shareholders . Maximum assessments on domestic individuals ' income will be capped at 40 percent , compared with the maximum 55 percent before the merger . Currently , foreign investors ' income is taxed first by a 25 percent business income tax , and then a 20 percent dividend tax on the 75 percent untaxed part , making the rate 40 percent . Economists said the tax reform would only encourage domestic investment , not foreign investment . " Such a tax reduction reform will surely boost domestic investment , " said Sun Ke - nan , a panel member from the prestigious Chunghua Institution for Economic Research . " But we don ' t see any improvement on how to encourge foreign investment in the proposal , " he said . " In order to develop Taiwan into an Asia - Pacific financial centre , we may consider lowering the dividend tax on foreign investors to 15 percent from the current 20 percent , " Sun said . Foreign investors said they wanted more . " The tax reform really doesn ' t benefit foreign corporations at all , because foreign investors still have to pay 20 percent in dividend tax , and that dampens investment interest a great deal , " said Ken Sien , a partner at Price Waterhouse . " The dividend tax tilts the playing field against foreigners . Taiwan must cancel that tax . . . if it really wants to become an Asia - Pacific financial centre , " Sien said . Sun said the planned levy of 10 percent on enterprises ' reserved profits would discourage high - tech investments as they now enjoyed tax - free treatment of reserved profits of up to 200 percent of capitalisation .

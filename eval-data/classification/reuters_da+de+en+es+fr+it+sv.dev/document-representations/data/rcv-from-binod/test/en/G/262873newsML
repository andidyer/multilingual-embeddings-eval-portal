Khmer Rouge vow to protect exiled Cambodian prince . Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said on Tuesday his guerrillas would protect exiled Prince Norodom Sirivudh if the prince returned to Cambodia . " Prince Sirivudh , come back here . We will support and protect him , " Khieu Samphan said in a broadcast on clandestine Khmer Rouge radio . Sirivudh , the half - brother of King Norodom Sihanouk , was exiled to France nearly one year ago after being accused of plotting to assassinate Second Prime Minister Hun Sen . He was sentenced in absentia to ten years in jail . Sirivudh has since vowed to return , raising the ire of Hun Sen , who declared at the weekend that he would forcefully prevent the prince ' s plane from landing and call out troops and tanks to the Phnom Penh airport . Khieu Samphan offered to protect Sirivudh , adding that " Hun Sen ' s declaration was very rude . It was not suitable for a prime minister to say . " Khmer Rouge hardliners recently vowed to kill Hun Sen . The hardliners have been angered by his encouragement of recent mass defections of Khmer Rouge troops to the government side . Top officials from Hun Sen ' s Cambodian People ' s Party and Ranariddh ' s FUNCINPEC party had an informal meeting over dinner last night , but they denied reports that the occasion was prompted by tensions over the Sirivudh case . " This is an alliance committee that meets every month for dinner , " said Loy Sim Chheang , secretary general of the FUNCINPEC party . " We didn ' t discuss tensions . . . or Sirivudh . We already know the situation , and each side has to solve the problem , " he said .

Asia Fuel Oil - Stable for now , but seen weakening . The Singapore high sulphur fuel oil market was quiet on Monday but traders said prices could be under pressure before the arrival of some Mediterranean and Middle East cargoes from next week . An offer for the 180 - cst grade was heard at $ 102 . 50 per tonne for late June / early July lifting but there was no buying interest , traders said . At least five cargoes are sailing eastward and are expected to arrive in Singapore in the second half of June , with one 380 - cst cargo heard offered by a western owner at a premium of $ 1 . 50 above Singapore published quotes , traders said . " The offer is too high . No - one is interested , " one trader said , adding that the western owner will have to lower the offer to sell his cargo . Imminent supplies plus a lack of fresh buying support are likely to add pressure to prices in the already slow market , trader said . On Tuedasy , Taiwan ' s state - owned Chinese Petroleum Corp ( CPC ) will close a tender to sell 30 , 000 tonnes of 3 . 0 - percent fuel oil for lifting in the the first half of July .

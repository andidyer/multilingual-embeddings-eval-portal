Winter heat wave in U . S . to greet 1997 - forecasters . New Year ' s revelers in much of the U . S . will toast 1997 surrounded by spring - like weather , including highs of 70 degrees Fahrenheit from Kansas to Texas and 50s to 60s in the Midwest , forecasters said . " The big news is it will be quite warm , " said Joel Burgio , Weather Services Corp meteorologist . The warmup will be welcome relief for much of the north central United States which has had nearly a week of sub - zero weather and abundant snowfall . The two feet or more of snow on the ground from Montana to Minnesota may keep highs in the 20s there next week . But , Burgio said after the recent sub - zero weather there , the 20s " will feel like a heat wave . " Highs of 40s to 50s were forecast in northern Nebraska to northern Illinois beginning Sunday , while low 60s were likely across southern Nebraska and Kansas , and high 60s to 70s in Oklahoma and Texas . Fred Gesser , president of Weather Express Inc , said the warm spell should last until January 4 , when another cool weather system may move into the United Statyes from Canada . Although the system is still developing , Gesser said rain may precede the system and snow may fall behind it .

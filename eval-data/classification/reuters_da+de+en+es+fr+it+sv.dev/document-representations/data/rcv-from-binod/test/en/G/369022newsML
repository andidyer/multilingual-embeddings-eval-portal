Zaire says Ugandan military plane crashed in east . A Ugandan military plane carrying fresh troops into eastern Zaire has crashed inside the Zairean border , a senior defence ministry official in Kinshasa said on Tuesday . The official told Reuters the plane crashed on Monday night in the Ruwenzori mountain area and that Zairean troops there had taken the survivors prisoner . There was no independent confirmation of the report . Zaire has repeatedly accused Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi of invading in support of Tutsi - led rebels who hold towns and territory along their eastern border . " It was a cargo plane from Uganda . A contingent of Ugandan troops were on board , " the official said . " Several people died but the death toll is not known yet . The survivors have been captured by a group of Zairean soldiers who were around the crash site . " Ruwenzori , 220 km ( 140 miles ) north of the rebel headquarters in Goma , is close to Beni where the official reported heavy fighting between the army and the rebels . He said Beni was partly controlled by rebels and partly by the army .

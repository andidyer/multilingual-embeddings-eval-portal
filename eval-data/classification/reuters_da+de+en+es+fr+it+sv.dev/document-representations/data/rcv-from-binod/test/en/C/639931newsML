Victorias , creditors fail to reach accord . Troubled Victorias Milling Co and its creditor - banks have sought another 90 - day period to reach a moratorium deal , Central Bank deputy governor Alberto Reyes said on Thursday . Victorias and its 32 creditors have failed to sign an agreement to pave the way for a debt payment moratorium and debt restructuring package for the sugar miller . The parties had originally planned to sign an agreement by the middle of the month . The banks have allowed Victorias to waive the principal payment of its 4 . 423 billion peso ( $ 168 milion ) loan , but not the interest payment . Reyes said not all banks have signed the deal because of disagreements on terms between banks whose loans were secured and those whose loans were not . He declined to elaborate . The final restructuring plan can include new loans as well as extending the maturity of existing loans , Reyes added . Victorias , itself , would also be restructured for it to become profitable . Aside from sugar milling , Victorias also has interests in engineering , management , technical services , agribusiness and food manufacturing . In the meantime , the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to conduct an audit on the books of Victorias to determine the primary reasons for its troubles . The audit team will determine whether company officials have taken steps to prevent the ballooning of its debts . Victorias said its woes were caused by the long slump in the sugar industry , and not due to over - diversification . - - Manila Newsroom ( 63 2 ) 841 - 8938 Fax 817 - 6267

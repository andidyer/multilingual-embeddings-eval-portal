Romania leu ends down , money market rates up . Romania ' s leu ended Wednesday softer with dealers ' quotes ranging from 8 , 000 / 100 to 8 , 355 / 455 to the dollar against 8 , 000 / 8 , 050 to 8 , 200 / 300 in early trading on an interbank market still facing hard currency squeezes . " There were some attempts to push the leu lower today , but growing leu shortages prevented bigger dips , " said one dealer . Short - term rates jumped to 150 - 152 percent from 140 percent in the morning on a cash - starved money market , traders said . Some traders said the leu might stabilise or even see an upward correction in the next few weeks with help from continued leu shortages . " Dollar demand is high , but there is also a rush for leu funds . I don ' t think the greenback will soon have the stomach to breach the 9 , 000 lei level , " said another dealer . Operators were keen to see whether the central bank would intervene to prop up the leu in coming days , either by selling dollars or using leu - dollar swaps to supply much - needed leu funds on the market . Trading livened up after foreign exchange curbs were scrapped on Tuesday , but no significant interbank deals emerged yet , traders said . Market participants hailed the central bank ' s ( BNR ) move to restore local dealer licences to 24 banks , which now act as market makers along with the previous four dealers . Latest data show zero interbank volume on Tuesday , when overall trading stood at $ 7 . 33 million . Leu - dollar prices at licenced money changing bureaux ranged from 7 , 940 / 8 , 400 to 8 , 100 / 8 , 600 . - - Mirela Eremia , Bucharest Newsroom 40 - 1 3120264

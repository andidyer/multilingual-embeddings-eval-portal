China ' s Jiang to visit India , Tibet exiles protest . Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday begins an historic visit to India aimed at improving ties between the world ' s two most populous nations . Only hours before he arrived in New Delhi for a three - day state visit , Tibetan demonstrators demanding China quit their homeland staged a noisy protest in the Indian capital . More than 600 protesters burnt an effigy of Jiang , the first Chinese head of state to visit India , and set fire to the Chinese flag at a Tibetan refugee camp in the city . To keep delicate bilateral relations on track , both India and China were expected to avoid dwelling on the contentious issue of Tibet during official talks . Indian officials say one step towards improving ties could be a troop reduction along a disputed Himalayan frontier , as well as a spur to trade and investment . The two countries , home to one - third of humanity , fought a brief border war in 1962 and troops are still deployed along both sides of a rugged line of control . " The Jiang visit comes at a point when India and China can , if they politically so desire , give a boost to their ties , " columnist D . Sen wrote in the Hindustan Times daily . Jiang , due to travel to Pakistan on Sunday , will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen , Minister of Foreign Trade Wu Yi , Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering and the chairman of the Tibet Autonomus Regions Government , Gyain Cain Norbu . He will meet President Shankar Dayal Sharma , Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda , Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and other senior officials . He will also address a business forum . Salman Haider , the highest ranking civil servant in India ' s foreign ministry , said pacts on bilateral investment protection and strengthening shipping services were being finalised . In the years ended in March 1995 , bilateral trade totalled a modest 31 . 7 billion rupees ( $ 889 million ) . Pro - democracy Tibetan exiles said they planned to continue demonstrations throughout Jiang ' s visit . No arrests were reported during the protest . Tibetan Freedom Movement leaders said they planned to present an open letter to Jiang written in their own blood . The New Delhi office of the Dalai Lama , Tibet ' s exiled spiritual leader , said it was not encouraging the protests . India and China signed an agreement in 1993 to ease tension along their 4 , 000 km ( 2 , 500 mile ) border during a visit by former prime minister P . V . Narasimha Rao to Beijing . In August 1995 , India and China agreed to pull back their troops from four border posts in India ' s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh , parts of which are claimed by China . Officials said an agreement on confidence building measures along the line of actual control was expected to be signed during Jiang ' s visit . Indian Foreign Secretary Haider said this would take a step further the agreement on maintenance of peace and tranquility on the border , signed during former Prime Minister P . V . Narasimha Rao ' s visit to Beijing in 1993 . Foreign ministry officials said China ' s defence cooperation with Pakistan , India ' s traditional rival , would be among issues discussed during Jiang ' s talks with Indian leaders . Pakistan has enjoyed close relations with China since the 1960s . In recent years , the two countries have been accused of secret nuclear and missile deals , which both have denied .

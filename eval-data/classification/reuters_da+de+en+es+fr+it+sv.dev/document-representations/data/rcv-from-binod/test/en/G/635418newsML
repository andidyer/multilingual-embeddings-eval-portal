China dissidents petition parliament . A dissident and the families of two jailed activists have petitioned China ' s parliament over human rights abuses ahead of the eighth anniversary of the bloody 1989 crackdown on a pro - democracy movement . Shen Liangqing , a prosecutor - turned - dissident in the eastern province of Anhui , said on Tuesday he wrote to the National People ' s Congress this week demanding a reassessment of the June 4 , 1989 , crushing of pro - democracy demonstrations in Beijing . The 35 - year - old activist also demanded the release of dissidents , including Wei Jingsheng , widely regarded as the father of China ' s modern democracy movement , and permission for the return of political exiles . " It could bring ( me ) some trouble . . . but I don ' t care , " Shen said of his petition to parliament . Shen was released from detention in September 1993 when Beijing was bidding to host the Olympics . He was retroactively sentenced last December to 17 months in prison for his role in pro - democracy demonstrations in Anhui province in 1989 . His sentence included time already served in detention but he was stripped of his job as a prosecutor . " China has no ( democratic ) voices . I hope there ' ll be such voices , " he said by telephone from Anhui ' s capital Hefei . In Beijing , the wives of two jailed Shanghai dissidents sent parliament a petition calling for the release of the two men , one of the wives said by telephone . The wives of Yao Zhenxian , 43 , and Yao Zhenxiang , 37 , also accused police of brutality , said Zhu Yaping , the wife of Yao Zhenxiang . " We have been driven beyond the limits of forbearance and strongly demand punishment for those police personnel responsible , " the wives said in their petition . Yao Zhenxiang fled to Hong Kong in 1994 and was granted political asylum in France . He returned to Shanghai in February 1996 after police promised not to arrest him . Despite the promise , the brothers were arrested in April last year , and accused of illegally leaving China and distributing pornographic material . The long - time supporters of China ' s democracy movement were ordered to serve up to three years of " re - education through labour " at a labour camp in the eastern , coastal province of Jiangsu . Re - education through labour is an administrative punishment that can be imposed without benefit of trial , and political analysts say Chinese officials increasingly favour it as a way of removing political dissidents from circulation . International human rights groups and Western governments have criticised Beijing for silencing dissidents in 1996 - - a year that saw members of the tiny pro - democracy movement jailed , intimidated or driven into exile . Beijing rejects criticism of its policies on dissent as interference in its internal affairs , arguing that the right to the bare necessities of life is more important than political rights . " We cannot say China ' s human rights situation is perfect , " the official China Daily on Tuesday quoted Zhu Muzhi , head of the China Society for the Study of Human Rights , as saying . " But the most urgent requirement of people , the right to subsistence and development , has been basically met and people ' s living standards continue to improve , " Zhu said .

Who ' s afraid of the fast food giants ? Not Sonic . MacDonald ' s and Burger King are America ' s biggest fast food chains , but a little known Oklahoma - based drive - in might have the most - loyal customers . The fast - growing Sonic chain , based in Oklahoma City , has built a loyal following with personalized service , marketing itself as not just another cheap burger . The strategy has paid off . Sonic has tied with Wendy ' s as the nation ' s favourite hamburger chain in the latest survey by Restaurant & Institutions magazine . Other independent research found that the Oklahoma chain has enjoyed among the highest customer loyalty ratings of all quick - service , hamburger restaurants since 1989 . An enviable growth rate of more than 20 percent a year provides more evidence of a loyal following . Sonic Corp . is already the nation ' s largest chain of drive - in restaurants , with 1 , 500 in the South Central and Southeast states . Sonic sets itself apart from the big fast - food chains by operating with up to three dozen drive - in stalls per restaurant , compared to just one or two at most McDonald ' s and Wendy ' s drive - thrus . Sonic still uses 1950s - style car hops , including some on roller skates , to deliver orders , and average service time is only four minutes . Besides that , the chain offers an unusual marketing package that includes Coney Island foot - long cheese dogs , hand - battered onion rings , " tater - tots " and cherry limeade . Sonic surveys some 7 , 000 customers every three months to gauge its strengths and weaknesses , as well as their views on competitors , and it incorporates it all into a marketing plan . Sonic keeps increasing its annual advertising budget 15 percent to 20 percent each year to add new customers in the Southern tier of states . " Sonic ' s car - hop format provides a highly differentiated experience that has built customer loyalty and enabled the company to steer clear of the hamburger price wars , " says Steven Rockwell , food - industry analyst at Alex Brown & Sons , Baltimore investment bankers . Sonic ' s 20 - percent - plus growth contrasts with low single digits at the big , quick - service , hamburger chains . But , rather than go mass market like its large competitors and invade all 50 states , Sonic has chosen to stay in the warm - weather states where it can provide specialised service to a niche market . " The whole focus in our marketing is on our points of differentiation , " says Pattye Moore , Sonic ' s senior vice president for marketing and brand development . She cites a typical TV ad for Sonic that begins with a " Brand X " drive - in window with a line of frustrated customers . " Then , " she says , " we switch to our drive - in stalls where ' you are always the first one with your own stall . ' Our wide menu is posted at the stall , each with a speaker , so that you can quickly order . " She believes that the push on personal service sets Sonic apart . " We were founded on the principle of personal service which means that our food is made to order . Food is not warmed and then placed under a heating element . We do prepare to some extent but no food is made until you order . " The " Drive In for a Change " ad theme has been in use for the last two years . Barkley & Evergreen , Kansas City , Mo . , is the advertising agency . " Sonic has monthly promotions usually starting the first and the last day of the month and we use ( TV ) commercials for them , " Barkley & Evergreen President Scott Ayleward said . " We also use some radio and print , as well . But no network , only local spots are used . The biggest markets are Dallas , Houston , Oklahoma City and Kansas City , Mo . , " he said . Although the company is puny compared with the giant operators , its performance numbers are among the best in the industry , and the chain is growing fast . Sonic adds an amibitious 130 to 150 new units a year . Still , says the company ' s marketer , Moore , " We don ' t want to be the biggest . We believe we occupy a special niche and we want to stick with it and do the best job we can . "

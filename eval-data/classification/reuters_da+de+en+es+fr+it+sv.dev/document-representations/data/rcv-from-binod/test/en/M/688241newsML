CSCE coffee tumbles , September ends at 10 - week low . CSCE coffee futures ended sharply lower and toward the bottom of the day ' s range on Thursday , pounded by chart - driven speculative and local selling , dealers said . They said continued mild weather in top - grower Brazil and a build up in stocks pending CSCE certification added to today ' s bearish tone . " The funds were selling and they are getting short now , " said Allendale Inc analyst Jim Cordier . " The mild weather is just the nail in the coffin . I thought we were going to get to these price levels eventually , but warm weather is getting us there faster . " Benchmark September arabicas tumbled 13 . 40 cents per lb , or nearly eight percent on the day , to 166 . 10 , its lowest settlement since April 15 , after ranging from 181 . 00 to 165 . 00 . Spot July finished 9 . 75 cents lower , at 190 . 25 , while the outer months fell 1 . 90 to 11 . 15 . The July / September switch bulged to 24 . 15 cents , from 19 . 85 cents at the close on Wednesday , while September / December narrowed to 19 . 85 cents compared with 22 . 75 cents . Coffee prices rose at the outset , defying pre - opening expectations , as dealers followed through on Wednesday ' s strong finish . But September ' s inability to get through Wednesday ' s high of 181 . 00 cents , prompted locals to unload their long positions . Downward momentum accelerated after September pierced key support levels at 174 . 00 cents , and last week ' s low of 168 . 75 cents , triggering sell stops and sending to September to its lowest level in more than 10 weeks , they said . Forecasts calling for mild weather over the next several days in top - grower Brazil continued to dampen sentiment , traders said . Weather Services Corp said Thursday no damaging cold is indicated through the first half of next week in Brazil ' s coffee belt . Colder air building in Argentina will pass to the south of Brazilian coffee - growing regions this weekend as a high pressure system continues to dominate the area , WSC said . " There is no cold weather in Brazil , " said one trader . " There ' s more stocks pending grading and in the backround of all this is the Brazilian harvest coming in . " CSCE reported after Thursday ' s close that certified coffee stocks rose by 246 60 - kg bags as of June 25 , to 46 , 173 bags . There were 11 , 695 bags pending grading , the exchange said . Unconfirmed rumors swirled around the market today that a substantial amount of coffee from Europe would be coming up for grading , but some traders were skeptical . " Europe is not going to bring over coffee , they need it over there , " said one trader . He added that exchange - certified coffee stockpiles were still extremely low and are likely to decline further in the coming months ahead the autumn harvest of many mild new - crop coffees . Traders said the market ' s movement continued to be exaggerated by a lack of liquidity . Total open interest remained unimpressive at 20 , 400 lots as of June 25 , less than half the open interest seen three months ago . On the charts , traders said the September contract ' s close below 168 . 00 - 170 . 00 cents was technically bearish . They said September would now face support at 160 . 00 cents , with some traders eyeing the 150 . 00 level . Turnover was fairly brisk , at an estimated 10 , 469 lots .

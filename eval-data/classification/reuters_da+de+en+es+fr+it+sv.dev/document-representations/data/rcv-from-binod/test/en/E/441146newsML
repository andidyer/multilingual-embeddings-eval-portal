February retail sales strong after big January jump . Sales by retail stores rose briskly in February after the strongest surge in nearly a year during January , the Commerce Department said on Thursday , reflecting robust consumer demand at the beginning of 1997 . Total retail sales increased 0 . 8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 213 . 18 billion after a sharply revised 1 . 5 percent jump in January - - more than double the previuously reported 0 . 6 percent pickup in January sales . The revised January sales increase was the strongest monthly gain since February last year , when sales soared by 1 . 9 percent . A department official said sales of virtually all types of goods were revised upward in January . Many retailers were still in the process of closing their books on year - end sales during January , so revisions in that month tend to be larger than for other months , the official said . The 0 . 8 percent pickup in February sales this year , building on the revised January surge , was stronger than the 0 . 6 percent rise that Wall Street economists had forecast . Analysts said before the report was released that steady job and income gains , a rising stock market and generally strong consumer confidence were bolstering retail demand . That was reflected in the February sales report , which showed a 1 . 6 percent jump to $ 87 . 6 billion in sales of costly and long - lasting durable goods like new cars , hardware and furniture after a 1 . 5 percent January rise . Sales of more quickly used nondurables , such as food , drugs and gasoline , were up more moderately last month by 0 . 2 percent to $ 125 . 6 billion following a much stronger 1 . 5 percent January gain . During February , sales by automobile dealers rose 1 . 7 percent to $ 53 billion after a 1 . 9 percent increase in January . New cars account for one - quarter of total retail sales , so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures . Excluding cars , retail sales rose 0 . 5 percent last month after a 1 . 4 percent pickup in January . Sales by general merchandise stores increased 1 . 8 percent in February to $ 27 . 5 billion after a 3 percent gain in January . At apparel stores , sales of clothing rose 0 . 4 percent after climbing 2 . 8 percent in January . Sales of building materials and hardware shot up 2 . 2 percent last month to $ 11 . 6 billion after a 1 . 6 percent increase in January . Sales and construction of new homes has been relatively strong in the opening months of the year . Sales by food stores dropped 0 . 2 percent last month following a 0 . 4 percent January gain . Similarly , gasoline service station sales declined 0 . 2 percent after rising solidly by 2 percent in January .

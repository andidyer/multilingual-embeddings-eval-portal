LIFFE cocoa pulls back , ends at day ' s lows . Cocoa futures erased their slim gains on the back of a higher - than - expected rise in the second quarter U . S . grind to end Friday lower on profit - taking . Traders said some eleventh - hour selling orders probably knocked the market much lower . Persistent strength of sterling against the mark also did not help the situation . The market was called five stg down and headed lower at the outset with benchmark September hitting a low at 1 , 016 stg in the morning after breaking the previous 1 , 020 support . But it then pared some losses towards the midday break as sterling slipped slightly against the mark . The market stepped into the plus column in the afternoon after the release of the U . S . grind data , which showed a rise of 17 . 5 percent to 97 , 223 tonnes in the second quarter over the same 1996 quarter . But the rise was shortlived and the late selling ensured September finished the session ' s bottom at 1 , 015 stg , a nine stg loss on the day . Traders said there was not much buying on the back of the grind figures , which came well above earlier expectations of five to 10 percent higher . " The funds and specs are long anyway and are thinking of getting out , " another said . On the charts , London ' s contract faces an important support at 1 , 000 , last tested on July 3 . Cocoa traders are keeping a close eye on latest U . S . CFTC Commitment of Traders report due to be released later on Friday . - - Jalil Hamid , London newsroom + 44 171 542 4985

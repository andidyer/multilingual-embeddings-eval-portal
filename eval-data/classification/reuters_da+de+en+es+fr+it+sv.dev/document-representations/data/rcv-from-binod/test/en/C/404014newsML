Polish cabinet ' s banking law debate in two weeks . Poland ' s new Finance Minister Marek Belka said on Wednesday that the government should discuss a draft of the new banking law in about two weeks . " In two weeks I will ask the council of ministers to send the bill to parliament , " Belka told a news conference . He said the bill , drafted by the central bank in consultations with the finance ministry , provides for adjusting Poland ' s banking regulations to the European Union ' s standards . The central bank has urged the government to speed up work on the bill saying the current 1989 regulations were making effective monitoring and supervision of the banking sector increasingly difficult because the regulations fell behind the sector ' s fast development . The government ' s economic committee approved the new draft in December 1996 and the whole cabinet was due to debate the bill early this year . The new bill would recognise new banking products and adjust regulations to more stringent safety requirements introduced in the last few years . - - Warsaw Newsroom + 48 22 653 9700

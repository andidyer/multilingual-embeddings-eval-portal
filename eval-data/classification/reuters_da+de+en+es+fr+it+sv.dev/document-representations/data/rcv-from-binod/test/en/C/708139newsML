Ireland ' s troubled Bell Lines put into liquidation . Dublin ' s High Court on Friday put Ireland ' s troubled Bell Lines into liquidation after efforts to assemble a rescue package failed . The court was told that the Waterford - based company , which employs about 200 people in Ireland , had debts of around 40 million Irish pounds . The judge appointed David Hughes of Ernst and Young as liquidator . Hughes had been trying to find backers to save the line . He directed that two directors of the line , Patrick Hayden and John Hearne , should make a statement of the company ' s affairs to the liquidator . He rejected an application on behalf of Waterford Harbour Commissioners and a number of British haulage operators for accountant Rory O ' Farrell to be named liquidator . Other creditors include haulage companies in Britain and elsewhere which employ hundreds of people , the court was told . Waterford Harbour Commissioners are owed around 10 million pounds , 25 Irish haulage companies two million and 25 Dutch haulage contractors were owed 2 . 3 million pounds . A consortium comprising the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society , ACT Venture Capital and Dublin - based ports and transport group Imari had proposed a rescue plan for Bell Lines but it collapsed this week . It proposed injecting between three and five million Irish pounds ( $ 4 . 5 - $ 7 . 6 million ) cash into the company . A previous consortium including Irish Continental Group , NatWest Venture Capital and Citycorp Venture Capital , which together owned 85 percent of Bell Lines , pulled out of a proposed three million pound rescue package at the beginning of June due to opposition from some creditors . Opposition came mainly from Waterford Harbour Commissioners and the Ministry for Marine which would have acted as guarantor of the port ' s debts . Bell Lines , which has trading debts of around 20 million pounds , ran into difficulties in 1995 and 1996 mainly due to a freight price war on the North Sea and competition from the Channel Tunnel . Ireland ' s employers ' grouping IBEC this week expressed concern about Bell Lines ' imminent collapse because of the loss of a port facility during Ireland ' s economic boom and the reduction of jobs in Waterford and elsewhere . Bell Lines has outlets in Limerick , Cork , Sligo , Cavan and Belfast and railheads throughout the country . - - Dublin Newsroom + 353 - 1 - 661 3377

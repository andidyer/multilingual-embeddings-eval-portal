CBOT soybeans end lower , weather keeps volume thin . CBOT soybean futures ended a subdued session lower on Friday with new crop months a shade weaker in consolidation trade ahead of what was expected to be a critical weather weekend , traders said . Extended forecasts called for continued dry weather in the U . S . Midwest but midday updates suggested a few showers could reach dry pockets of Illinois and Indiana this weekend . " Latest short range guidance indicates a few light showers will occur over northern portions of the Midwest tonight ( Friday ) and in the south on Saturday , " Weather Services Corp wrote in the midday update . " Most of the activity will be under 0 . 25 inch with only spotty coverage , " WSC said . Dry weather has been the catalyst for this week ' s 60 cent - per - bushel climb in November soybeans but traders said any hint of moisture could quickly wipe out that weather premium . Soybeans ended six cents per bushel lower to unchanged with August down six at $ 7 . 62 . August had traded higher early in the session after CBOT said soybean registrations in Chicago fell to 10 , 000 bushels from 965 , 000 on Thursday . No deliveries have been posted against the August . " The August beans had a brief pop earlier in the session when they announced the bean registrations drop , " said John Kleist , president of Sagamore Partner ' s Commodity Advisory Group . There have been no soybeans posted against the August contract but some traders had been expecting up to 500 , 000 bushels would be posted in the next few days . The cut in registrations diminished talk of deliveries but traders noted soybeans could quickly be posted for delivery again . But August struggled much of the day amid continued weakness in cash basis levels and reports of farmer selling . The National Oilseed Processors Association weekly crush report was neutral . NOPA early Friday said the U . S . soy crush during the week ended July 30 totalled 23 . 577 million bushels , within the range of expectations for 22 . 7 million to 24 . 2 million bushels . On the day , Refco Inc sold 2 . 5 million bushels November and ADM sold two million November , traders said . Cargill Investor Services bought four million bushels November . In options , Rosenthal Collins bought 500 November $ 6 . 00 puts at 12 - 1 / 2 to 13 cents , floor sources said . Louis Dreyfus bought 200 November $ 6 . 50 puts at 33 cents . Options volatility in the November was pegged at 34 percent , against Thursday ' s 27 - 1 / 2 percent . Soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 55 , 000 contracts , compared with Thursday ' s actual volume of 70 , 000 . Options volume was pegged at 24 , 000 contracts , against Thursday ' s 34 , 206 . ( ( Emily Kaiser 312 - 408 - 8749 ) )

UAE ' s first mutual fund allows more foreigners in . The UAE ' s first mutual fund has lifted the ceiling for foreign participation to 49 percent from 20 percent in response to vigorous foreign interest , an Emirates Bank International ( EBI ) official said on Saturday . EBI are the managers for the Emirates Equity Fund . " We had framed ( foreign participation ) at 20 percent initially on the grounds of being a little conservative . Seeing the pattern of subscription we had to revise our views , " the official told Reuters . United Arab Emirates company law allows 49 percent foreign ownership . " Our understanding was that our scheme fell within the guidelines for equity investments which the government has , " he said . The decision re - opened subscription for non - nationals , which was temporarily suspended after their subscription exceeded the 20 percent limit . The open - ended fund has attracted subscriptions of about 270 million dirhams ( $ 74 million ) , far above the 30 to 50 million dirhams fund managers expected to raise , the official said . " The foreign interest was mostly from overseas institutional investors who would like to be involved in the UAE equity market , " he said . " There was also some interest from expatriates based in the UAE . " About three - quarters of the UAE ' s 2 . 4 million people are foreigners , who have so far been excluded from the market . In the past year the UAE market , capitalised at around 64 billion dirhams , has moved up about 30 percent . With widespread investment interest in the mutual fund , the price of units - - set at 100 dirhams in the initial offer period - - has risen by almost three percent . " We have an offer price of 102 . 93 dirhams as of July 13 . Tomorrow ( Sunday ) a fresh price will be advised . It ' s a weekly dealing cycle , " the official said . The minimum investment in the fund ' s initial offer period was 10 , 000 dirhams and subscription was open for one month from June 1 . After that period the fund was kept open for nationals . EBI is 80 percent owned by the government of UAE member Dubai . The rest is held by about 750 private investors . ( $ 1 = 3 . 67 dirhams ) - - Dubai newsroom + 9714 6071 222

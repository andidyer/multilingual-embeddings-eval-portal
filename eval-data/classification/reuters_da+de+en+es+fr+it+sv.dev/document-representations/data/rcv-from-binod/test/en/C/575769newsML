Codelco output lost to storm seen recoverable . A rainstorm at Codelco ' s Chuquicamata copper mine caused a four - hour power cut on Sunday but production lost to the blackout can be recovered in the short term , the mine said in a statement . The storm caused " some disruption to the continuity of operations due to an electricity cut that lasted approximately four hours , " said the statement . " This situation limited the operational capacity of the company ' s plants and equipment , " said the statement , adding that emergency crews moved into gear and kept the daily production at no more than 20 percent . " This percentage will not affect quarterly or annual production and is absolutely recoverable in the short term , " said the statement issued by Chuquicamata ' s public relations office . The mine produced 150 , 400 tonnes of copper in the first quarter of this year compared to 149 , 500 tonnes in the first quarter of 1996 , Codelco said last week .

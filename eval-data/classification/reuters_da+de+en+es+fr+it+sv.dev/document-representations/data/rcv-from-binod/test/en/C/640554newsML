Pakistan gives incentives for bad debt repayment . The State ( central ) Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) said on Thursday it had offered a scheme of inventives to loan defaulters to encourage settlement and recovery bad debts estimated at 127 billion rupees . " As a prelude to a determined pursuit of defaulters and to provide a one - time opportunity to them to voluntarily settle the matter of their pending obligations , the State Bank has decided to introduce a scheme of incentives , " SBP Governor Muhammad Yaqub told reporters in Karachi . He said the scheme , that will be in force for six months from Friday , would be offered to all categories of loan defaulters without discrimination . He said the scheme would be mandatory for state - run banks and financial institutions but SBP would give full support to private banks if they too followed suit . Under the scheme , Yaqub said defaults of seven years and above could pay the original principal amount plus five percent of the same principal . For defaults of three years and above but of less than seven years , the borrower can pay the principal amount plus 20 percent of the principal , he said . For defaults of one year and above but less than three years , payment of the principal plus 40 percent of the principal amount or 75 percent of the accrued interest , whichever is less , will be acceptable as final settlement . Yaqub said all loan defaulters wishing to take advantage of the scheme should approach banks or financial institutions to which owed money within one month starting on Friday . He said if the estimated 8 , 100 loan defaulters failed to take advantage of the scheme or settle their dues , legal action would be taken against them under a recently legislated law that provides for speedy recovery of stuck up loans . He said under the law , new banking courts would be set up with far reaching foreclosure powers to speed up recovery and put a stop to flow of new bad debts . " We have assurances from the highest levels that no interference would be made whatsoever in the process of recovery and full backing from the State Bank would be available for banks to pursue the defaulters , " Yaqub said .

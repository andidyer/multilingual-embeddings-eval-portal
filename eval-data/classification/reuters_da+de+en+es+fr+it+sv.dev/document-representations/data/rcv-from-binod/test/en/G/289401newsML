Algerian rebels stage more attacks . Moslem guerrillas killed 18 people in an overnight attack in an Algerian village and four others in the capital Algiers just as the Algerian prime minister said his government had crushed rebel violence . Algerian security forces , in a statement on the official Algerian news agency APS , said on Monday 18 people were also wounded in the attack on Douaouda village in the coastal province of Tipaza , 60 km ( 37 miles ) west of Algiers . The statement blamed the attack on a " group of terrorists " , the official term for Moslem guerrillas who have been fighting the government since 1992 . Residents of the village reached by telephone said that about 60 rebels came down from the surrounding mountain , blocked roads and then went on a bloody rampage . " Villagers suspected the attackers were from the same group that carried out the raid the night before in Ben Achour village , " said one resident . About 50 rebels stormed Ben Achour village in Blida province , 50 km ( 30 miles ) south of Algiers on Saturday night , killing 16 people from five families , including a disabled man . Liberte newspaper said on Monday the Ben Achour attack was led by an aide to Antar Zouabri , leader of Algeria ' s ruthless guerrilla group Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) . Residents of the capital Algiers , speaking by telephone , said that on Sunday night Moslem guerrillas broke into a real - estate office and killed the dirctor and three female employees in the Ain Benian suburb . There was no official statement but residents said the four may have been killed because they refused to pay money to the rebels . Others said security forces may have killed up to six rebels suspected of taking part in the attack . The three successive attacks bring to at least 38 the number of people killed by rebels within the past 24 hours in Algeria . But Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyhia , in a speech to the unelected body that acts as parliament , said that " terrorism has really been reduced to a residual level . " " The results achieved on the ground allow the government to reiterate that terrorism in Algeria has been defeated , " he said at the weekend . Meanwhile in France , the daily Le Monde said it had received a statement from the outlawed Islamic Salvation Army ( AIS ) accusing Algiers of involvement in " horrible crimes " and warning Western states against aiding the Algerian authorities . The warning came a little over a month after the rush - hour bombing of a Paris commuter train on December 3 in which four people died . French investigators suspect GIA in the Paris train bombing . GIA ' s Zouabri had reported in December 24 as threatening to " destroy " France . Zouabri reportedly had sent a letter to the French President Jacques Chirac vowing to " continue " attacks in France unless he intervened to free GIA prisoners in Algeria . The overnight attack in Douaouda village was the third bloody assault on the people there in about two months . Moslem guerrillas beheaded five construction workers in Douaouda on New Year ' s eve while 10 women and three children had their throats fatally slit in November , Algerian newspapers had reported . The AIS , in a turf - war with GIA to transform Algeria into an Islamic republic , is known as the armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) , mainstream political fundamentalist group banned in Algeria . The AIS distanced itself from the killings of civilians , mostly blamed on the GIA . The Moslem guerrilla was launched after the authorities cancelled 1992 general elections that the FIS was poised to win . Some 60 , 000 people , including many civilians and more than 100 foreigners , have died in subsequent violence .

FOCUS - GEC picks deal - maker to run finance . [ CORRECTED 14 : 27 GMT ] Shares in General Electric Co Plc jumped on Tuesday on news that a young deal - maker was taking over as finance director , reinforcing hopes that new chief George Simpson is gearing up for change at the famously staid group . The company said it had recruited John Mayo , the 41 - year old finance director at drugs firm Zeneca Group Plc to replace David Newlands , who quit earlier this month in a shake - up of top management . " He looks a more than adequate replacement , " said one analyst who declined to be named . An accountant by profession , Mayo joined Zeneca in 1993 from investment bank SBC Warburg where he was the corporate finance director working for ICI on the demerger of Zeneca . GEC ' s shares were up 14 - 1 / 2 pence on the news , at 358 - 1 / 2p , by 1230 GMT . " With his involvement in the break - up of ICI , people are just putting two and two together , " said one share trader . " John has a well deserved reputation as one of this country ' s best finance directors , " Simpson said in a brief satement announcing the appointment ( corrects by adding Simpson as the source of the quote ) . His experience with Warburg and ICI . . . are highly relevant to the challenges and opportunities now facing GEC . I look forward to working with him . " Last month Simpson unveiled plans to overturn predecessor Lord Weinstock ' s 30 - year - old strategy , unwinding joint ventures and refocusing on the defence and space group GEC - Marconi . Simpson , also about to be made a Lord by Britain ' s new Labour Government , raised the prospect of a four billion pound float of the GEC - Alsthom rail and power joint venture with France ' s Alcatel Alsthom and a repositioning of its GPT telecoms joint venture with Siemens of Germany . He also promised to move GEC ' s cash mountain of over a billion pounds , either by making acquisitions or by a giving cash back to shareholders if no deals emerge , but made clear the strategic overhaul could take several years to bear fruit . " The big issues at GEC revolve around how rapidly and successfully they manage to move the refocusing programme ahead , " said one analyst who declined to be named . " The key issue is how GEC restructures itself and how quickly it improves the return to shareholders . Mayo and he expect to shake it up a bit and certainly they should be prepared to take a fresher approach to some of the shareholder value issues which Simpson is trying to promote .

NZ ' s Shipley rules out privatising ACC . Accident Compensation Corporation Minister Jenny Shipley on Thursday ruled out privatisation of ACC by the coalition government , but said it would refocus the scheme . " The coalition government is committeed to re - focussing ACC by restoring it to a comprehensive but affordable scheme , " Shipley said in a speech to a government to business forum organised by employers . Employers and big business lobby groups have urged the government to privatise the scheme , which compensates victims of accidents regardless of fault and replaced the right of victims of accidents to sue . Shipley warned against simple solutions , saying those who advocated privatisation needed to look at the past . " ACC carries $ 7 . 1 billion of liabilities for accidents which occurred in the past and these must continue to be funded , " she said . " It is inappropriate to imply that previous accidents could be overlooked , and it is also inappropriate to advocate privatisation without offering a solution to existing costs . " She said a move to a privately - owned , insurance - based scheme would also be a move away from a no - fault scheme . " This would see a return of the right to sue and I do not believe New Zealanders want that . Nor do I think those who argue for privatisation have fully considered the cost of the court regaining a prominent role . " She said she was aware the push for competition or privatisation was driven partly by a desire to reduce the cost of the scheme to business , and the government was determined to bring down the average levy . To do that the scheme would need to be generous to the seriously injured while maintaining realistic boundaries . She said for the less seriously injured the focus , where possible , should be on rehabilitation and a return to work . She said the government would decide later this year whether an " excess " would be introduced below which either the person injured or employers would pay medical costs . - - Wellington newsroom 64 4 473 4746

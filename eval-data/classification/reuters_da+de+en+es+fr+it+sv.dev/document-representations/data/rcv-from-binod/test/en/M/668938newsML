Traders said improving weather conditions in top - grower Ivory Coast may have prompted some selling .

Cocoa prices fell at the opening , pressured by commission house selling , dealers said . Downward momentum accelerated after the September contract fell through near - term support at $ 1 , 614 .

Technically , many traders views that the market still needed a downward correction after setting new highs weighed on sentiment today . Major support for September was seen at $ 1 , 577 , with a chart gap looming between $ 1 , 540 and $ 1 , 516 . On the upside , resistance was pegged at $ 1 , 625 - $ 1 , 629 , they said . On the fundamental side , heavy rains in Ecuador could cause mold in its cocoa crop , adversely affecting the quality and hurting the country ' s exports , Ecuadorean industry officials said on Wednesday . National Cocoa Exporters Association president Jose Carvajal said that if the developing weather pattern El Nino continued to bring rainfall to Ecuador , the Christmas crop would sustain damage . " If the rains keep up until August and September , then the end of year crop is going to be damaged , " Carvajal said . Some New York traders , however , remained skeptical , saying it was still too early to gauge the effects of El Nino .

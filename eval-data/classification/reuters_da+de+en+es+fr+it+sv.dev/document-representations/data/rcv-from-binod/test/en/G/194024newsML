Pope reflects on life , death and priesthood in book . Pope John Paul reflects on his life amid the horrors of World War Two Poland , his love for the theatre as a young man , and his decision to enter the priesthood in a new book released on Friday . In the book , on the theme of the Roman Catholic priesthood , he explains that he did not have romantic relationships as a young man because he was consumed by a budding spirituality and a passion for acting and drama . The Pope ' s book , which appears to be written mostly for a readership of priests , also confirms the Catholic rule of celibacy and indirectly - - by the repeated use of the words " man " and " he " - - his view that women cannot be ordained . The 120 - page book , " Gift and Mystery - - on the 50th Anniversary of my Priesthood " , is the 76 - year - old Pope ' s nostalgic walk down the memory lane of his youth and a tribute to the simple people who helped him . Released by the Vatican ' s publishing house , it follows the Pope ' s 1995 book , " Crossing the Threshold of Hope " , which was published commercially and became an international best - seller . Karol Wojtyla was a handsome young man in his native Wadowice and later Krakow with a spirituality inherited from his parents - - both of whom died by the time he was 21 - - and a love for the theatre and Polish literature . Biographers concur that the Pope had no romantic relationships as a young man in secondary school and university but he has rarely spoken or written about the subject himself . " Maybe someone thought that if a young man with such clear religious inclinations did not enter the seminary ( earlier ) it was a sign that other loves or interests were at play , " he says in the Italian text . " In fact at school I had many female colleagues and because I was involved in the school theatre club , had numerous possibilities to meet people . " That was not what was at issue . At that time I was consumed by passion for literature , particularly for dramatic literature , and the theatre . " Most biographers say that a least one of Karol Wojtyla ' s female classmates fell in love with him , however . It was the " apocalypse " of World War Two , the Pope writes , that changed his life . To avoid deportation and continue his studies secretly after the Nazis invaded his homeland in 1939 , he worked in a stone quarry and later a factory . The Pope was obsessed by questions of life and death , asking himself often why he was surviving the dangers and despair of the German occupation while others perished . " At any time I could have been picked up at home , at the quarry , at the factory and taken to a concentration camp . At times I asked myself : " So many people my age were losing their lives . Why not me ? ' Now I know it was not just chance . " he says . The Pope says it is precisely because God spared his life while death was all around him that he felt he owed a tremendous debt to people " of all nations and language " who were killed . Knowing the exhaustion of physical labour first - hand left him with a life - long affinity and respect for workers , whose simple kindness he recognises in the book . In 1942 he made a definitive decision to enter the seminary and studied for the priesthood secretly in the archbishop of Krakow ' s residence until the end of the war . He was ordained a priest on November 1 , 1946 . " The tragedy of the war helped me put a new slant on the value and importance of ( my ) vocation . Faced with the spreading of evil and the atrocities of the war , the sense of the priesthood and its mission in the world became ever more clear to me , " the Pope writes .

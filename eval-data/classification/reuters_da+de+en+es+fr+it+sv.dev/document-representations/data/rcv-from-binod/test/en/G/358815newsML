Four Timorese to leave French embassy for Portugal . Four East Timorese men who broke into the French embassy in Jakarta will leave for political asylum in Portugal on Wednesday , diplomatic sources said . " They will leave for Portugal today . They will use a KLM flight to Amsterdam before continuing their journey to Lisbon , " one source told Reuters by telephone . The French Foreign Ministry had said in Paris the four Timorese , who entered the embassy before dawn on Tuesday , would be allowed to leave for Portugal . The source said that as usual the travel arrangements of the four men would be handled by the International Committee of the Red Cross . Since September 1995 , 96 young East Timorese have broken into foreign embassies in Jakarta and all have been given asylum in Portugal , the former colonial power in the enclave invaded by Indonesia in December 1975 . The four scaled the three - metre ( 10 - foot ) spiked iron fence surrounding the French embassy compound in central Jakarta , unfurled a banner shouting " Viva East Timor " and other pro - independence slogans . East Timorese sources identified the men as Ru Ximenes , 26 , Akilis Siqueira , 21 , Bonifacio Cardoso Diaz , 18 , and Siquito Valenti , 18 , all from Los Palos on the eastern tip of the territory .

Bolivia sends team to Peru , sets up crisis cabinet . Bolivia on Wednesday sent a mission to Peru and set up a special ministerial team to deal with an alleged demand by leftist rebels holding hundreds of hostages in Lima that Bolivia release four guerrillas . Communications Minister Mauricio Balcazar said Bolivia had heard by " verbal report " that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) might be demanding the release of its members detained in Bolivia . He said President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada was sending a team to monitor the situation in Lima , where MRTA rebels were holding up to 490 hostages at the Japanese embassy . Bolivian ambassador Jorge Gumucio was one of the hostages taken by the guerrillas who stormed an embassy party on Tuesday night , demanding that jailed comrades be freed . Balcazar said the team would have no negotiating power . He added that a special group comprising the ministers of foreign relations , defence , government and communications would follow the case closely and keep the president informed . Bolivia ' s MRTA prisoners are being held in La Paz jails for their alleged role in the kidnapping of former planning minister Samuel Doria Medina last year . Balcazar deplored the attack and demanded the rebels release their hostages unharmed .

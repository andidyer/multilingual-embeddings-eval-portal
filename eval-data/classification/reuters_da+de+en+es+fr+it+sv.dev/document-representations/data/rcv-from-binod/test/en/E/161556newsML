FORECAST - Italy Nov PSBR seen below 19 . 5 trln lire . The effects of Italy ' s June mini - budget for 16 . 5 trillion lire extra of deficit cutting measures will help confine public sector borrowing in November to below the 19 . 5 trillion required a year ago , economists said . But analysts polled by Reuters said improvements in the public sector borrowing requirement ( PSBR ) last December would not recur and Italy would end 1996 with a budget deficit closer to 130 trillion lire than to the government ' s 123 trillion goal . The budget deficit for November would be between 14 trillion and 18 . 2 trillion lire , giving an accumulated deficit of around 127 trillion lire , economists said . Their forecast for PSBR for the year matches that of the Bank of Italy which earlier on Thursday said the deficit in the first nine months of 1996 reached 95 . 9 trillion lire , some 2 . 5 trillion lire more than in the same period last year . The central bank , which assesses the budget deficit in a different way to the Treasury , said without further government interventions , this year ' s deficit would come in " around 130 trillion lire " . Last year ' s deficit was 130 trillion lire . Economists said apart from the effects of the mini - budget , cuts in the official discount rate would also help to contain the budget deficit as these had reduced debt servicing costs .

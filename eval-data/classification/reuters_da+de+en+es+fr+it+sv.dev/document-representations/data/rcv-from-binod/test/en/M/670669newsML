INSIGHT - Sept T - bond seen correcting after rally . U . S . September Treasury bond futures hovered in a tight range Wednesday , continuing to blow off steam after recent steep gains , some technicians said . September hit a four - month high at 112 - 10 / 32 Tuesday after several days of gains , but stalled out to post an outside - down - day on bar charts . Some chartists said the formation protends sideways consolidation or a correction . " We had nine - straight days of really good gains in here until yesterday , so we could see some continued profit - taking , " said Holly Liss , technical analyst with Sakura Dellsher Inc . " So the fact that you were so strong and you ' re weaker now to me is healthy , " Liss said . " It gives us the fuel to head higher . " She said a move through 111 - 16 / 32 support would draw September down to 110 - 30 / 32 . Overall , she said she holds her intermediate upside targets at 112 - 29 / 32 to 113 - 10 / 32 . Stewart Taylor , president of Taylor Consulting , agreed that the market still appears overbought . " I expect that the next few sessions will be spent relieving the hourly overbought condition that has accrued over the last few weeks , " Taylor said . He pegged support at 111 - 24 / 32 to 25 / 32 and again at 111 - 15 / 32 to 17 / 32 . " A daily close below 111 - 8 / 32 to 9 / 32 would offer significant cause for concern , " Taylor said . " For now , no overtly bearish behaviors have manifested themselves , " he said . By mid - morning Wednesday , September T - bonds had matched Tuesday ' s 111 - 17 / 32 session low and edged off the low to gravitate around 111 - 23 / 32 to 24 / 32 . " It hasn ' t fallen apart , " noted Sakura ' s Liss . " It is resilient right now . " Traders said the market still appears to be headed for higher prices after it consolidates from the four - month high . " Current momentum is still bullish and we ' re just in a correction , " said Paul Hare , technical analyst with LIT ' s The Linn Group . He pegged good support at 111 - 16 / 32 , and said the market still appears on track to challenge February ' s high . On February 18 , September peaked at 113 - 9 / 32 .

Iran flexes its muscles with new submarine . Iran ' s new Russian - made submarine will enable it to keep playing a cat - and - mouse game with Washington and flex its naval muscles in an oil - rich region lined with nervous Gulf Arab neighbours . The Kilo - class submarine which cruised into Iranian waters at the weekend is no match for the American military might closely monitoring Iranian activity in the Gulf , military analysts say . They doubt that Tehran would provoke U . S . military retaliation but said the vessel gives Iran additional military firepower , enhancing its ability to torpedo tankers carrying oil - - the industrialised world ' s most prized commodity . " I think the Islamic republic understands red lines it cannot cross such as overt military aggression , " said Kenneth Timmerman , director of Middle East Data Project , a strategic consulting firm in Washington . " But the submarine is a very serious addition to Iran ' s ability to lay mines in the Persian Gulf and interdict shipping , " he added . Iran , which already has two other Kilo diesel - powered submarines , launched a programme to upgrade its weaponry after its military was bled by the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq . It is the only Gulf state to deploy submarines in the waterway . " It is not overpowering or the be all and end all , " said a Western military analyst . " But the new unit will be in a much higher state of readiness . The crew training has been done . They have done things faster than the West expected . It does not take a lot to lay mines from a covert platform and fire a sophisticated torpedo at a ship and wreak havoc . " Non - Arab Iran has focused its arms buildup on its navy in the strategic Gulf which sits on about 70 percent of the world ' s oil reserves . That has fueled concerns in the United States which has vowed to protect its Gulf Arab allies from what it says are Iran ' s aggressive aims and growing military capabilities . " We are watching the arrival of the new Kilo . Such a sophisticated vessel like the Kilo poses a potential threat so we do keep a close eye on their submarines as well as all their forces , " said U . S . Navy spokesman Commander T . McCreary . Tehran insists its arms buildup is purely defensive and accuses Washington of stoking regional tensions to sell billions of dollars of weapons to wealthy Gulf Arab allies . U . S . officials say Iran has restored its capability to fire anti - ship missiles at sea , has in the past two years tripled the number of missiles deployed on its Gulf coast and is fitting Chinese - built cruise missiles on up to 20 naval boats . Timmerman and other analysts estimate Iran has pumped about $ 2 billion a year since 1988 into selectively modernising its military . " They have not purchased a large number of tanks and artillery and there has been no large buildup of ground forces . They have concentrated on naval capabilities , " he said . Gulf states have also poured billions of dollars into bolstering their small armed forces but have increasingly looked to Washington for protection . They are also worried that an Iraq weakened by crippling United Nations sanctions has created a military imbalance and left them vulnerable to Iran which has staged extensive naval war games , including test firing of anti - ship cruise missiles . " We would like to see Iraq as a major peace element in the area and to create a good balance and to have a stabilised Iraq . We hope to see this very soon in Iraq , " United Arab Emirates Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan bin Zaid al - Nahayan told Reuters recently . With 513 , 000 active armed forces and an arsenal including the submarines , missiles , destroyers , frigates , coastal and patrol vessels , 1 , 440 tanks and 295 combat aircraft , battle - hardened Iran dwarfs its Gulf Arab neighbours . But analysts say Tehran has proven that it knows just how far Washington , which has about 20 , 000 troops and 24 ships including destroyers and at least one submarine stationed in the region , and its Gulf Arab allies can be pushed . " Iran has tried to exploit the grey areas , " said Timmerman , referring to Iran ' s alleged military buildup on Gulf islands at the centre of a territorial dispute between Tehran and the UAE . The UAE accuses Iran of deploying offensive missiles on the islands but Tehran has brushed aside the criticism and vowed to defend its territorial integrity . And it seems the new Iranian submarine is the latest reminder of geopolitics in the volatile Gulf . It is named Yunes ( Jonah ) - 3 , after the Koranic and Biblical prophet who was swallowed by a whale but was saved by God .

Clinton may decide soon on Mexico drug ruling . President Bill Clinton on Friday completed a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other advisers and may decide later in the day whether to certify Mexico as a U . S . ally in the drug war . White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Albright went back to the State Department to work further on a final recommendation , which she would attempt to send back to the president later in the day . " We will see later today whether she is in a position to forward her final recommendations to the president . If she does , the president will consider them . I don ' t rule out the possibility that he might act on them later today , " McCurry said . He said no final recommendation had come from Albright yet and Clinton had made no final decision . Top aides gave indications the United States would certify its southern neighbor as helping to fight drug trafficking , thus avoiding a cut - off in some U . S . aid , economic sanctions and a blow to Mexico ' s national pride . But there was also a possibility Clinton could " decertify " Mexico as punishment for a lack of anti - narcotics efforts , but waive any sanctions for now to give Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo time to show he is working on it .

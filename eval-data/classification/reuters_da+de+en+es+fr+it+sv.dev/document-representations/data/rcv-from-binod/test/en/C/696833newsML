Scottish & Newcastle profits up 21 percent . Britain ' s largest brewer , Scottish and Newcastle Plc , on Monday posted a 21 percent rise in its annual profits and said the blocking of a merger between Bass Plc and brewer Carlsberg - Tetley should favour the group . Profit before tax and exceptional items to 374 million pounds ( $ 621 . 7 million ) , reflecting a surge in sales of food and improved margins on its key beer brands in the second half of the year to April 27 . Group finance directors Derek Wilkinson told Reuters said the decision by Britain ' s Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett on Friday to block the Bass / Carlsberg plan should favour it . " We frankly would have lived with either decision but on balance the decision is more favourable to us because it leaves us as number one with the dominant position and a strong brand range , " said Wilkinson . " Carlsberg is bound to be a weaker player in the marketplace . It will have to cut its cost base and try to rebuild its brands . Clearly that is an advantage to us , " he added . If approved the merger would have created Britain ' s largest brewer with a 35 percent share of the beer market , leapfrogging Scottish and Newcastle which makes about 29 of every 100 pints consumed . When asked about the company ' s trading outlook for the coming six months Wilkinson said the group had made an encouraging start to the year . The results were at the top end of analysts forecast range of between 361 to 380 million pounds . S & N shares rise 7 - 1 / 2p to 657 - 1 / 2p in early trade before falling back to 651 . Net margins on S & N beer rose to 8 . 2 percent in the year to April 27 , 1997 up from 6 . 8 percent , helped by strong sales of Foster ' s lager and John Smith ' s ale and a decision by S & N to take a lead in the industry to resist pressure for lower prices . In the first half of the year S & N ' s beer sales fell by 3 . 0 percent and in the second half by 1 . 5 percent , compared with a market decline of one percent . " We believe that the industry has to address the problem of falling margins . We had to shed some volume in the first half but in the second half we held our market share and margins rose . It ' s been a case of shedding unprofitable volume , " said Wilkinson . Profits from the beer business rose to 177 million pounds in the year up from 121 . 4 million in 1996 . The group ' s beer division also benefited from the successful integration of Courage , acquired from Australian brewer Fosters in 1995 . The company , which faces the loss of an important beer supply contract to the IEL ( Inntrepreneur Estate ) pub estate in March 1998 , hopes to replace this loss of volume with new contracts , said Wilkinson . " We anticipate we will retain some of the volume and we will probably have to increase discount levels . We should also replace it with other contracts . Last week for instance you saw we signed one with Wolverhampton & Dudley , " he said . S & N ' s three year supply contract with IEL for 800 , 000 barrels a year is at less favourable rates for IEL pub tenants than they could get elsewhere . When asked about the poor performance of the group ' s Center Parc holiday villages in mainland Europe , Wilkinson said he expected an improvement in the weak economic environment in which they operate in the second half of 1997 . " We have seen some improving trends , especially in Holland and Belgium . " My own personal view is that we will see some delay in EMU ( European Monetary Union ) and then we will see a more constructive approach to economies in Europe . They will try to reduce unemployment and reflate the economy to some extent , " he said . Profits from the group ' s Center Parcs fell 12 percent in the year to 72 . 2 million pounds , held back by sterling , which strengthened on average by 10 percent against major European currencies , and low levels of consumer confidence in mainland Europe . The group ' s retail division however delivered a nine percent improvement in profits to 171 . 6 million pounds , driven especially by a programme of converting old sites to Chef & Brewer pub restaurants . The company plans to spend 150 million pounds in the coming year on its retail division , up some 30 million on the 1996 / 97 financial year . S & N still has about 350 Chef & Brewer sites yet to develop . ( $ = 0 . 601 British Pounds )

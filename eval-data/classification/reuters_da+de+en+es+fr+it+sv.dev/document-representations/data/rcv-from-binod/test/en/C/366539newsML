S . Africa Wooltru interim EPS seen at 49 . 9 - 57 cents . Analysts differ on Wooltru Ltd ' s interim results later this month as the retail group weighs plans to list separately subsidiaries Woolworths and Truworths . Earnings predictions range between 49 . 9 cents and 57 cents compared to last year ' s 48 cents while interim dividend forecasts range between 18 . 5 cents and 21 cents compared to 18 cents . The results will be released on February 19 . The more bearish forecasts have undoubtedly been affected by reports that retailers have been hampered by sluggish sales , mounting bad debts and shrinking margins . Illegal clothing imports have also affected retail stores with many consumers preferring to buy their clothes from market stalls , where prices are cheaper . " The whole sector has been quite depressed , " said one analyst . But even if Woolworths and Truworths have done relatively well due to tight management , it is widely expected that results at the downmarket Massmart division will brake growth . Partly prompted by this market perception , Wooltru has been finalising plans to list Truworths and Woolworths separately to reflect their real value , while not ruling out the possibility of listing Massmart . Wooltru does not plan to raise any cash through the listings and is instead thinking of issuing shares to existing shareholders , customers or suppliers . - - Cape Town newsroom + 27 21 25 - 2238

U . S . OPTIONS FOCUS / Index calls rolled up on rally . Investors were rolling call positions up to higher strike prices and others were buying puts as U . S . stocks rallied sharply in a holiday - shortened session , traders said Thursday . The market ' s rally , which was linked to weaker than expected U . S . employment data for June , drove several market measures into record territory . By about 1110 CDT / 1610 GMT , the bellwether Dow industrial average . DJI was up 77 points at 7 , 872 , off its record 7 , 896 intraday high . The S & P 100 index . OEX was up nearly 12 points at about 893 and the S & P 500 . SPX added 12 to roughly 916 . September S & P 500 index futures were up 8 . 80 at 924 . 30 after setting a record high at 929 . Traders said the rally , combined with the fact that that the jobless report was out of the way , helped to drive down volatilities in the options . The Chicago Board Options Exchange ' s volatility index . VIX , priced off certain OEX contracts , was down 0 . 75 , or 3 . 5 percent , at 20 . 67 . Earlier this week , the VIX had climbed to 24 . 65 . " All the in - the - money calls were for sale this morning , " said Jack Callahan , an independent market maker in the OEX . " They were selling the in - the - moneys and buying the out - of - the - moneys . " He added that investors were also buying puts as the market rallied . " It ' s another day , another uptick , " he added , referring to the market ' s uncanny ability to maintain the strong upside track on which it started the year . Jerry Hegarty , an options analyst at Thomson Financial Services , said the two - day , 25 - point rally in S & P 500 futures leading into Thursday ' s employment report showed investors were unconcerned about the number , which has long been a focus for Wall Street . " The idea of backing off before the number , those days are over , " he said . " One of the problems that analysts can have is you start applying common sense and history and all that , but this is one of those rare occasions where it doesn ' t matter , " he said . " The market ' s just too strong . " ( ( Gregory Crawford , 312 408 8750 ) ) E - mail : derivatives @ reuters . com

Getz Brothers has represented St . Jude in Japan and other areas of the Asia / Pacific region for many years . In addition to purchasing Medtel , the transaction includes Getz ' s acquisition of the Telectronics brand name . The companies also signed a five - year agreement for the Pacesetter unit of St .

" Today ' s announcement is positive for the company as we no longer will be in the distribution business in this region and will use the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt . " St . Jude develops , manufactures and distributes medical devices for the global cardiovascular market . ( ( Reuters Chicago Newsdesk ( 312 ) 408 - 8787 ) )

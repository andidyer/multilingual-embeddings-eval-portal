JGBs seen aiming high after rise on LIFFE . The key September 10 - year Japanese government bond futures contract is expected to open near 125 . 00 and test the upside on Friday , following a rise on LIFFE and a surge in U . S . Treasuries overnight , traders said . " JGBs are likely to kick the day off with a sharp rise . . . of about 0 . 30 point above the previous day ' s close , " said a senior trader for a city bank ' s securities unit . Traders said a sharp rise in U . S . Treasuries after the release of weaker - than - expected U . S . jobs data triggered the rise in JGBs on LIFFE . They said the market would focus on whether investors decide to buy following such a rise . " We can expect new long positions ( in JGB futures ) to appear for awhile , " said a trader for another city bank ' s securities unit . " But cash bonds have not been rising to the same extent as futures recently , and the focus will be on whether cash JGBs will be bought today , " he said . Traders said the September may rise as high as 125 . 30 during the day . The September ended at 124 . 99 on LIFFE overnight , up from Thursday ' s Tokyo close of 124 . 73 . It moved in a range of 124 . 73 to 125 . 00 on LIFFE . Investors may not be that eager to buy if JGBs rise sharply , judging from their recent stance toward JGBs , the first trader said . " It is true that buying by investors has partly been responsible for the recent rise in JGBs . But over the last couple of days , their tendency has been to say they would like to buy if JGBs fall to around 124 . 00 , " the trader said . Dealers probably have been mainly responsible for supporting JGBs in recent days , by buying despite the cautious stance among investors , he said . - - Tokyo Treasury Desk + 81 - 3 - 5473 - 3748

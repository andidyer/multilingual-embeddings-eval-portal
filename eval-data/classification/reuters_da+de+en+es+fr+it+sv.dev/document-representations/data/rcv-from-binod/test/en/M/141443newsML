Rate cuts hit high yielders but charts stay upbeat . Interest rate cuts have knocked some wind out of the sails of the buoyant Swedish crown and Italian lira , but technical analysts said the corrections were mere hiccups on the high - yielders ' bullish longer - term charts . The lira began Wednesday at 999 . 60 but lurched lower after the Bank of Italy sprang a discount rate cut late in the day on an unsuspecting market . It set a low of 1007 . 80 per mark today . Sweden ' s crown swung down to 4 . 3350 to the mark from late yesterday ' s 4 . 3140 / 70 after the Riksbank eased rates too . Karen Jones , technical analyst at Credit Suisse here , said the mark ' s stab through 4 . 33 crowns completed a small base stretching from 4 . 33 to 4 . 29 . That confirmed a short - term correction and set up a measured target of 4 . 37 . " A move to 4 . 37 barely impacts on what can only be described as an amazingly bearish chart , " said Jones . The mark has depreciated by 5 . 1 percent against the Swedish crown in the last two months and by 4 . 7 percent versus the Italian lira over the same period . Chart watchers said the mark was now gearing up to demolish trendline resistance around 1007 lire and attack 1013 . " The only resistance on the top short - term is from long positions , but we think the cross is on the way to touch 1013 . 50 , " said Paoli Mengoli , technical analyst at UBS in Lugano . That area represents a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the mark ' s decline from the July 31 high of 1036 . 70 lire to the 988 . 40 low hit on October 7 , analysts said . The next Fibonacci objective beyond there is around 1020 , the 61 . 8 percent retracement level of that downmove . Mark / lira stood at 1005 . 35 / 65 at 1120 GMT . Alan Dunne , technical analyst at BankAmerica in London , said mark / lira ' s break of 1002 . 50 had drawn an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the charts . " As long as it holds above 1002 now , potential to 1015 exists , " he said . Credit Suisse ' s Jones saw the mark failing initially in the 1007 / 1008 region before rallying to around 1013 / 15 . " The reason I think that because mark / stocky is so bid , and mark / stocky usually leads the rest ( of the crosses ) , " she said . Analysts noted that 38 . 2 percent of the mark ' s slide from the 4 . 4955 Swedish crown peak of August 29 to the October 14 low of 4 . 2870 cut in around 4 . 3670 . A breach there would open 4 . 37 ahead of the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level near 4 . 3910 , they said . The mark was quoted at 4 . 3220 / 50 at today ' s midsession . But on a bigger scale , chartists said moves such as a lira fall to 1013 or a Swedish crown decline to 4 . 37 were nothing to write home about . " I must say in the scheme of things this will make zero impact on the bear trend - - ( mark / lira ) has moved down for a very long time so 50 percent is the minimum retracement , really , " said Jones . " Unless it does something completely out of the ordinary , I ' ll stay with the view that they are correcting only . " - - London Newsroom + 44 - 171 - 542 - 8968

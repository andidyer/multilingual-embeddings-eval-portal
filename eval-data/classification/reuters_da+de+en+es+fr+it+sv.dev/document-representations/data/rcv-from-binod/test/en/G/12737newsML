Iranian Kurds in Iraq say Iran planning attack . Iranian Kurdish rebels say Iranian troops have entered northern Iraq to prepare a new assault on Kurdish guerrillas and refugees . The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan ( KDPI ) , in a statement received in Nicosia on Saturday , said Iran had sent more troops to the region in the past few days to launch fresh attacks . The statement appealed to other Kurds , Iranian political groups and international organisations to pressure Tehran to prevent it " from perpetrating this savage act " . The group is based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the Baghdad government . A small number of Iranian troops briefly entered northern Iraq last month in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas . The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) on Wednesday accused Iranian forces of killing or wounding around 100 people in daily artillery attacks this week on its positions in northern Iraq . A KDP spokesman accused Tehran of having entered fighting in northern Iraq in support of KDP ' s rival , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . PUK and KDP have had northern Iraq under their control since Baghdad ' s forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf war .

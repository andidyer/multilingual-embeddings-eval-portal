D . Telekom rejects divestment of cable tv . Deutsche Telekom AG , the German telecommunications group , on Wednesday sharply dismissed suggestions by Bonn politicians and its competitors that it should divest its cable TV network to promote competition . Calling the discussion " a lot of noise about nothing " , Telekom chairman Ron Sommer told reporters in Munich the discussion was aimed at damaging Telekom and that the company had no intention to part with the network , Europe ' s largest . In the United States cable TV operators and telephone companies were merging to create " full service networks " that combine broadcasting , telecommunications and Internet access while Telekom already owned such networks . " Through the special market situation in Germany the forced sale ( of the cable TV network ) would only have the effect of hurting Deutsche Telekom and its more than two million private shareholders , " he said . Just last week German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt , a member of the free - market Free Democrats ( FDP ) , suggested it would be a boost to competition on the German telecoms market if Telekom were made to sell off its cable TV network . Telecoms experts from Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democrats ( CDU ) have also suggested that Telekom break up the network into regional companies and allow independent operators to invest as minority shareholders . It has been widely speculated that a European Commission study of the relationship between cable operators and telecommunications companies to be concluded later this year could be used to force Telekom to sell its cable TV assets . Herbert May , head of business customers at the telephone giant , rejected any such idea and said he did not believe that the Commission would launch such an intiative . " There is no pressure from Brussels , " he said , adding that the company had no intention to break the network up into regional companies . Speaking in Hamburg this week , European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the Commission ' s study would be ready in May or June as part of its supervision of competition in telecoms and media . Scrutinising telecoms companies that also own cable television networks , the study would entertain three options : - - maintaining the status quo - - ending all restrictions on using telecommunications networks , even for cable television - - divestment of cable television networks by dominant market players . He said the core problem would be determining which options would be acceptable in terms of competition and which would lead to more competition in local telecoms markets . " At the same time we have to keep the door open for full utilisation of the synergies derived through the various networks , " he said at a conference on online services . Telekom chairman Sommer said it was not necessary to force the sale of the cable network to bring competition in the local networks . " For our competitors interconnection is a considerably less expensive and more competitive way to reach the customer , " he said .

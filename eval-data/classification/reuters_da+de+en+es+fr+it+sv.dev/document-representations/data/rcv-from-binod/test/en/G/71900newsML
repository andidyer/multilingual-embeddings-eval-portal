SOCCER - PARMA AND BAYERN , LAST TWO UEFA CUP WINNERS , CRASH OUT . Bayern Munich and Parma , the last two winners of the UEFA Cup , both crashed out of the competition on Tuesday . Bayern , whose grip on the trophy was prised open by Valencia two weeks ago , finally relinquished their hold when they were eliminated 3 - 1 on aggregate by the Spanish side despite winning the second leg 1 - 0 . Although Bayern won the second leg at the Olympic Stadium , they failed to turn their obvious superiority into sufficient goals . A softly - taken missed penalty by German skipper Juergen Klinsmann summed up his side ' s night . Bayern ' s only goal came after two minutes when defender Javi Navarro headed into his own net under pressure from Christian Ziege following Mario Basler ' s inswinging corner . If Klinsmann had converted the 15th - minute penalty , Bayern might have had a real chance of clawing back the deficit but despite going close several times - - they forced 10 corners to Valencia ' s none - - they could not score again . " If we can ' t even score from a penalty then how are we expected to win ? " said dismayed Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer . Bayern captain Lothar Matthaeus added : " We missed the chance early to go 2 - 0 up early on - - not just from Klinsmann ' s penalty . We had other good opportunities too . In the second half we tried to use too much force , but we lost the tie in Valencia , not here . " Parma , who won the UEFA Cup in 1995 , went to Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal holding a 2 - 1 lead from the first leg , but lost 2 - 0 for a 3 - 2 aggregate defeat . The Portuguese side won with goals from Vitor Paneira after 15 minutes and Ricardo Lopes , four minutes after the break . Guimaraes surprised powerful Parma with the force of their counter attack and scored two without reply to win the tie . Soon after Brazilian striker Gilmar Estevam lost a golden chance to score when Parma goalkeeper Buffon blocked his shot with his legs , international midfielder Paneira lobbed the ball over Buffon ' s head in the 15th minute . Striker Ricardo Lopes , whose goal was annulled when he was caught offside at the beginning of the second half , headed home in the 49th minute after the Italian defence failed to intercept a cross from the right . Striker Dino Baggio was Parma ' s most dangerous player but his 63rd minute header was disallowed after the referee ruled that he had fouled a Guimaraes defender . While Parma , and Bayern went out , Bayern ' s northern German rivals Hamburg reached the third round after an ill - tempered 2 - 0 win over Celtic which saw Celtic reduced to nine men and Hamburg finish with only 10 . Hamburg went through 4 - 0 on aggregate but were helped by some suicidal Celtic tackling and some harsh refereeing which left the Scottish team with just nine men by half - time . Malky Mackay and John Hughes were each dismissed for two bookable offences , while Hamburg ' s Markus Schupp was sent off in the second half by Belarus referee Viktor Schuk . As well as the dismissals , Celtic lost their leading scorer , Portuguese striker Jorge Cadete , after only 13 minutes when he was carried off following a vicious foul by Hamburg defender Stephane Henchoz . Celtic manager Tommy Burns had a furious on - the - pitch argument with the referee as the teams headed towards the dressing - room at half - time . Goals from Karsten Baron ( 24th ) and Andre Breitenreiter ( 50th ) sealed the Germans victory . Sweden , whose part - timers have consistently embarrased England ' s highly - paid stars in recent seasons , did so again with Helsingborgs , most of whose players earn 300 pounds a week , knocking out Aston Villa , whose players earn about 20 times more . Helsinborgs , who scraped a 1 - 1 draw in England two weeks ago , prevented Villa from scoring and with the match ending 0 - 0 Helsingborgs won on the away goals rule . Newcastle , fielding the world ' s most expensive player in the form of 15 million pounds ( $ 23 . 36 million ) striker Alan Shearer , also lost in Sweden , going down 2 - 1 to part - timers Halmstads but went through 5 - 2 on aggregate . Despite advancing , Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan blasted his highly - paid team afterwards . " We just didn ' t perform . We were average , right throughout the side . From front to back and back to front , nobody played well . We didn ' t deserve to win and the better team did win . They were the team that wanted it more and showed more enthusiasm . " Just 300 fans watched Portuguese club Boavista reach the second round on the away goals rule at Benfica ' s 120 , 000 - capacity stadium . Boavista used Benfica ' s ground for their home leg against Denmark ' s Odense after being banned by UEFA from playing at their own ground in Oporto . Two goals inside three minutes midway through the second half by Jasper Hjorth and Ulrik Pedersen gave Odense a 2 - 1 win on the night . But the aggregate score of 4 - 4 left Boavista winners on the away goals rule .

Pearson sees one - off cash collection delay . British Media and leisure group Pearson Plc said on Friday that as a result of the improper accounting at its subsidiary Penguin USA there will be a one - off delay in cash collection from many of its major North American customers . Chairman Lord Blakenham told shareholders at the company ' s annual meeting that this delay would affect cash flow in the first half of the year . The company said that Penguin had enjoyed a good start to the year , but noted that if the strength of sterling continues against the dollar and the Spanish peseta for the rest of the year there would be an impact on the sterling value of its main overseas profits versus 1996 . By 1152 GMT , shares in Pearson had risen 7 - 1 / 2 pence to stand at 720 pence . ( $ = 0 . 616 British Pounds )

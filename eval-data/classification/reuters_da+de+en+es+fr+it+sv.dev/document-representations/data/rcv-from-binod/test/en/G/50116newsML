Iraq ignores U . S . threats , mocks Clinton . Iraq ' s official media on Thursday made no mention of warnings by the United States that it would punish Baghdad for firing a missile at its fighter planes over northern Iraq . State - run television and radio continued with their normal programmes and government - controlled newspapers were silent despite apparent U . S . preparations for new strikes against Iraq . " Every time there is an attack we know more and more about U . S . intentions . We now completely realise it does not care about us at all . It is fighting for its own global benefits , " said a shop - owner in Rasheed street , Baghdad ' s main thoroughfare . Radio and television ridiculed U . S . policy towards Iraq and broadcast programmes and interviews mocking President Bill Clinton for leaving his agents and spies without cover in northern Iraq . The pro - Baghdad Kurdish faction of Massoud Barzani , thanks to President Saddam Hussein ' s military support , now controls most of Iraqi Kurdistan after routing forces of the rival Kurdish rebel leader Jalal Talabani in less than two weeks . The United States fired 44 cruise missiles at air defence targets in southern Iraq last week in response to Baghdad ' s military intervention on the side of Barzani . The Iraqi media hail Barzani ' s victory as a prelude to the end of U . S . influence in northern Iraq . In a signal of his control of events in the north , Saddam has already signed a number of decrees concerning Kurdish areas which until recently rebel Kurds administered away from Baghdad ' s authority . Residents in Baghdad said movement of people to and from Kurdish areas had returned to normal . Trade was carried on without restrictions , they said . Saddam on Tuesday ordered the removal of the internal blockade on Iraqi Kurds imposed shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 - the first fillip Barzani got for his liaison with Baghdad . The official press said on Thursday tens of thousands of people were moving to and from Kurdish areas every day . " After their failure to bring about a change in northern Iraq , both Clinton and ( Defence Secretary William ) Perry have nothing left to threaten Iraq with , " declared the official al - Qadissiya newspaper in a front - page editorial . Traders in Baghdad ' s Shorja district , Iraq ' s commercial hub , calculated benefits they were bound to reap from Saddam ' s decision to lift curbs on trade with Kurds . " You are asking me about another U . S . attack . More cruise missiles and bombs will not prevent me from going to Sulaimaniya . There are big business opportunities there , " said one trader said on Thursday . Sulaimaniya , a Talabani bastion and centre of contraband trade with Iran , fell to Barzani forces on Monday .

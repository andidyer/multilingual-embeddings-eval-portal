Manila shares lanced , further bleeding seen . The Philippine stock market , battered by anxieties over the peso and high interest rates , continued to bleed on Wednesday , heightening concerns about a possible slowdown in the country ' s economic growth . Analysts urged investors to stay out until the peso , effectively devalued when the central bank last week allowed the currency to trade in a wider band , had settled on firmer ground . Ignoring government appeals for calm , the main index cracked through its 2 , 600 support and tumbled sharply for the second straight day , ending down 2 . 58 percent at 2 , 587 . 36 . " Right now , the biggest enemy of the stock market or even investors for that matter is uncertainty , " said Jose Ricardo Garcia , vice - president of Diversified Securities Inc . " A lot of people still are uncertain as to where the Bangko Sentral ( central bank ) is going to go ; whether they ' re going to keep interest rates high or lower them . " In an effort to keep the peso above water , the central bank pushed rates to their highest level since the Mexican financial crisis threatened to hit the Philippine economy in early 1955 . The peso has fallen close to 12 percent since Friday ' s move by the central bank , when the Philippines became the latest Asian victim of repeated speculative currency attacks . The government says the rise in interest rates - - prime rates are as high as 35 percent - - is temporary but businessmen warn it is squeezing them to the limit . The central bank has also warned that it will not release its grip on monetary policy until the currency market calms down . Speculation which intially forced Thailand into a de facto devaluation has swept through Southeast Asian markets and has begun to put Latin American currencies under pressure . DBS Securities sales manager Bing Trinidad said high interest rates were sapping liquidity out of the equities market into higher yield fixed income instruments . " We are seeing more investors selling out for the simple reason that there ' s this uncertainty in the forex market , " said Jonathan Ravelas , Asian Capital Equities sales head . " It ' s like we are trading blindly and the best position is maybe for investors to stay out of the market until there is a clearer direction , " he added . " We are quite unsetttled by the events unfolding on the economic front , " Anscor Hagedorn Securities said in an advisory issued before the start of trading . " From a macro viewpoint , high borrowing rates will make it harder for companies to get financing , leading to slower economic growth . " All sub - indices on the stock market fell , with the commercial and industrial index plunging almost three percent . Several blue chips took a beating . San Miguel B shed 4 . 50 pesos to settle at 57 pesos , Manila Electric Co B dipped by seven pesos at 42 . 00 while Philippine oil refiner Petron Corp closed at its intra - day low of 5 . 70 pesos , down 0 . 50 centavos . The country ' s largest bank , Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co lost 5 . 00 pesos , ending at 545 . 00 . " Oil companies may have to increase petroleum prices as a result of the peso ' s depreciation . Most of them are hedged so the impact will not be much . But there ' s negative sentiment on how the companies will cope , " said Helen Alvarez , research director at All Asia Securities . " Right now , everything is up in the air . They don ' t know where the peso is finally going to settle . It ' s a situation where everybody is groping for answers , definite answers , " said chief economist Al Rillo of DBS Securities .

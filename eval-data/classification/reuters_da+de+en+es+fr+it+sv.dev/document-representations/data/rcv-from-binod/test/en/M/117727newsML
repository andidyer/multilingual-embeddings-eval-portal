Oil near 6 - year highs on pre - winter shortage . Buoyant world oil markets traded near six - year highs on Tuesday after resuming a storming bull run which has carried prices up 40 per cent in the space of four months . London November futures for international benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude broke above $ 25 a barrel for the first time since the 1990 / 1991 Gulf War after adding 88 cents on Monday . Brent has shot up by $ 7 a barrel since mid - June , driven by concern over tensions in the Middle East and persistently low stocks of heating oil in Western markets . By close November Brent had lost some 16 cents on the day , trading at $ 24 . 70 as traders took some profits following Monday ' s price leap . With the exception of the Gulf War , crude has not been as costly , in nominal terms , since the second oil price shock in the wake of the 1979 Iranian revolution . Fresh fighting between rival Kurdish factions in Iraq since the weekend has served to remind markets of the missing crude supplies previously expected under a United Nations oil - for - food exchange with Iraq . " Iraqi oil exports under U . N . resolution 986 this year are now impossibly remote and , in the light of recent developments in the Kurdish areas of Iraq , they may well not begin until the second half of 1997 - - if at all , " commented the Centre for Global Energy Studies ( CGES ) in London in a report . The U . N . deal , signed in May and worth several hundred thousand barrels a day of crude supplies , was suspended at the end of August after Baghdad sent troops to intervene on behalf of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) against its rival , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . The KDP on Tuesday launched a counter - attack after the PUK regained on Sunday the region ' s largest city , Sulaimaniya . It accused Iran of sending troops and arms to lead PUK attacks over the weekend but Tehran denied any involvement . Renewed fighting underlined how difficult it would be for the United Nations to guarantee the safety of aid distribution monitors in northern Iraq under the oil - for - food exchange any time soon , CGES chief economist Leo Drollas said . " Oil sales from Iraq are almost certainly out of the question now for some time to come . The oil market looks set to remain tight through the coming winter , " said Drollas . Dealers said low stocks of heating oil in the United States and Europe in the approach to winter had also propelled futures markets higher as refinery buyers and traders hedged against rising supply costs . The fund managers that control huge investment accounts have also joined the oil rally in force . Heating oil stocks are running about 10 per cent down on last year ' s already slim levels in both northwest Europe and the United States . Analysts say oil companies are partly to blame . Keen to cut costs by holding low inventories , some refiners have been caught short in a scramble to replenish winter stocks . A refinery fire in Toledo , Ohio , on Monday underlined how sensitive oil prices are likely to be this winter to supply outages , traders said . " This is a very jumpy market - - any supply disruptions are likely to have a disproportionate effect , " said a London - based oil trader . Meanwhile , markets look unlikely to get any help from extra OPEC supplies . The oil cartel , led by heavyweight Middle East Gulf producer Saudi Arabia , has no plans to raise output for fear of rocking the boat and undermining a market which is providing windfall extra revenues , Gulf sources said last week . Oil analysts estimate the 11 - member group will land a $ 25 billion windfall this year in extra oil export revenues .

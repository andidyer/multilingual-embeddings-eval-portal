Slovenia PM says will seek broad coalition . Slovenia ' s prime minister - designate Janez Drnovsek said on Tuesday he had started talks to build a broad coalition government that would include his main political rival , the conservative People ' s Party . " I will try to form a broad government that would enable reaching goals like membership in the EU and NATO and economic and social reforms where a large consensus is necessary , " Drnovsek told a news conference . Drnovsek , whose centre - left Liberal Democrats won 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats in an inconclusive general election last November , won a fresh mandate to form Slovenia ' s third government in a parliamentary vote last Tursday , Slovenia , which declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 , hopes to become a member of NATO in 1999 and of the European Union by the year 2001 . Drnovsek said he had met the head of the People ' s Party Marjan Podobnik earlier on Tuesday and invited Christian Democrat president Lojze Peterle and Janez Jansa , leader of the centre - right Social Democrats , to meet him on Wednesday . " In the next days I will hold intensive talks which should show which parties are ready to participate in the government and which not , " Drnovsek said . " Future talks will also show whether there will be an opposition and what it will be like , " he added . Drnovsek said he would also talk to other parliamentary parties , including the United List of Social Democrats , the former communist party , which has already said it would like to participate in the government . He has to present his government lineup to parliament by January 24 . Podobnik , whose party took second place in the election , with 19 seats , had ruled out working with Drnovsek before the parliamentary vote but said on Monday he would consider participating in a broad government . " We support a government of national unity in which all or most parliamentary parties would be included , " Podobnik said .

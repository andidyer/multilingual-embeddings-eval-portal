Romania investment company hits red tape . A Romanian private ownership fund turned into an investment firm under a mass privatisation law said on Tuesday its plans for active involvement in privatisation projects had become snared in red tape . " We will be heavily involved in privatisation . We have the liquidity to become a major player in this process , " Teodor Mihaescu , president of Societatea de Investitii Financiare " Muntenia " ( SIF " Muntenia " ) told Reuters . " We primarily plan to promote venture capital investment to restructure companies in which we have stakes . " He said " Muntenia " would focus on some 500 companies , especially in building materials , glass and ceramics and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics sectors . " These units ' technology is not bad , but they are undercapitalised , " Mihaescu said . " Pumping money into them will triple their market value in a year ' s time . " But the company ' s plans ran into trouble this year , when capital market regulator CNVM failed to approved its statute . Mihaescu said his firm had rejected a statute drawn up by the CNVM . " This is unacceptable . They should approve our draft . Without a statute , we could not organise our company , " he said . SIF " Muntenia " became an investment company of the U . S . mutual fund type last November . Before that , it was one of five regional private ownership funds created under a 1991 law . The funds administered 30 percent in 6 , 500 state companies on behalf of 15 million Romanians who obtained privatisation vouchers in 1992 . The remaining 70 percent shareholder was the State Ownership Fund ( FPS ) . SIF " Muntenia " ' s liquidity was the equivalent of $ 20 million at the end of last December , Mihaescu said . Conversion of the funds was part of the second wave of privatisation - - a mass selloff started in 1995 , offering Romanians up to 60 percent in some 5 , 000 companies in exchange for vouchers and coupons . Romanians could also place coupons with one of the funds in return for shares . Some 300 , 000 Romanians swapped coupons for stakes in " Muntenia " , bringing its capital to 300 billion lei . " We also have to sort out the issues of cession of the shares swapped for privatisation paper and of compensation with the FPS after the mass selloff before working out our portfolio , " Mihaescu said . - - Luli Popescu , Bucharest Newsroom 40 - 1 3120264

HK closes major Vietnamese boat people camp . Hong Kong on Friday closed one of its last two major detention camps for Vietnamese migrants , the scene of riots and a break - out earlier this year , bringing it one step closer to ending a 20 - year - old boat people saga . Under the watchful eye of some 600 security officers , about 1 , 000 Vietnamese were transferred from Whitehead detention centre to High Island camp , and another 530 were sent to temporary quarters pending forced repatriation later this month . Following the transfers , the main section of Whitehead , a bleak , concentration camp - like compound in Hong Kong ' s rural New Territories , will be closed , leaving High Island the only remaining major detention centre in the territory . " We are pleased that the transfer operation today at Whitehead has proceeded smoothly , " said Sally Wong , the government ' s acting refugee coordinator . " This is likely to be the last major operation at the camp . " Security was tight . Authorities were prepared with fire trucks and aircraft landing ramps in case Vietnamese resisted or took to the rooftops , but no trouble was reported . Riots shook Whitehead in May when more than 100 detainees staged a mass break - out and others set buildings ablaze and assaulted prison guards . Most of the fugitives were recaptured but much of the camp was left in ruins . Thousands of Vietnamese fled Vietnam ' s shores , often in small and barely seaworthy boats , in the 1970s after the communist victory in the nation ' s civil war . Whitehead opened in 1989 , shortly after Hong Kong and other nations of first asylum began screening arrivals to see if they were " genuine refugees " entitled to resettlement abroad rather than " economic migrants " who must return to Vietnam . It held 25 , 000 people in 1991 , back when the total boat people population in Hong Kong peaked at nearly 60 , 000 . Today , only about 6 , 300 remain in Hong Kong , and authorities are rushing to clear the camps before the British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty at midnight of June 30 . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) runs a voluntary repatriation programme , and the government has been stepping up a parallel series of forcible flights . Last year 6 , 963 Vietnamese were forcibly deported while 8 , 138 returned voluntarily , compared to 970 and 1 , 668 respectively in 1995 . " Should the current rate of repatriation continue , it should be possible to close all VM ( Vietnamese migrant ) camps by the middle of this year , " Wong said . A UNHCR official at Whitehead told government radio on Friday that he hoped the camp ' s closure would reinforce the message to those in High Island that returning to Vietnam was inevitable , and urged them to apply for voluntary repatriation . " The main problem is of course people ' s hopes that if they just hang on long enough then maybe some policy somewhere will change , " he said .

Marsh & McLennan Minet talk stuck on price . Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc said it is still in talks with St . Paul Cos Inc about the possible purchase of its Minet Group brokerage , but said the firms have had trouble agreeing on a purchase price . St . Paul in late January said it was negotiating to sell its Minet brokerage to Marsh & McLennan . " We continue to talk to Minet and St . Paul , " Marsh & McLennan chief executive A . J . C . Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview . " If we can reach an agreement , we would go ahead with a transaction with St . Paul and Minet , " he said . " But , " he said , " there are no assurances we can do that . " St . Paul hired Goldman Sachs in August to help it explore its strategic alternatives for the London based international insurance broker . Smith also moved to quash recent speculation about the company ' s plans for its Putnam asset management business . In an earlier conference call with analysts , Smith said he was happy with the Putnam business and wants to expand it . In his interview with Reuters , Smith also said he sees no reason for a spinoff of even a minority stake in Putnam . Speculation has circulated in recent months that Marsh & McLennan might sell a minority stake in Putnam to the public to establish a more fair market value for the business . " We study pretty much constantly the issue of whether the value of Putnam is properly recognized in the value of Marsh & McLennan stock , " Smith said . " We ' re very happy our shareholders recognize the value of Putnam , so there ' s no reason to spin off a minority portion to have the market recognize that value , " he said . " It ' s a very fine company with marvelous prospects and so we like owning it and we plan to continue owning all of it . " Regarding plans for growing Putnam , Smith said that although Putnam has not needed to make an acquistion " that doesn ' t mean for the right combination at the right price , we wouldn ' t be interested . " However , Smith said some of the recent transactions in that field have been done at very high prices . " We ' re not interested in paying a huge premium , " he said . Marsh & McLennan earlier announced a definitive agreement to buy privately - held insurance broker Johnson & Higgins for $ 1 . 8 billion . A new company to be known as J & H Marsh & McLennan Inc will be formed to manage the companies ' combined insurance services operations . It will operate as a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan . Smith and Johnson & Higgins chief executive David Olsen said the companies began exploratory talks about a possible combination several months ago . Olsen said Johnson & Higgins had been studying its strategic alternatives in light of the industry ' s growing competitive issues for some time . " We looked at lots of things , looked hard at ourselves , and came to the realization that we had to be part of something larger , " Olsen said , noting that as a privately - owned company , Johnson & Higgins faced capital constraints . Olsen said Johnson & Higgins also considered selling itself in an initial public offering and then using the capital to make acquisitions . " I think that was one of the options that were available to us , and the opportunity for raising cash internally in some other way was something we thought about , " Olsen said . " I think we looked at how we would use that , what acquisition opportunities there were and decided that wasn ' t our best opportunity , " he said . Both Smith and Olsen said their talks did not come about in response to Aon Corp ' s agreement to acquire Alexander & Alexander in December . Instead , he said , Marsh & McLennan ' s objective is to be the best , rather than the biggest , in the business . Smith declined comment , however , on whether the firm had considered a combination with any other broker . " Heaven knows that we ' ve been rumored to be talking to everybody , " he said . But , he said " we are always alert to the possibility of a combination that will be good for our clients , our staff and our shareholders , " Smith said . Johnson & Higgins was advised by Morgan Stanley and Marsh & McLennan was advised by JP Morgan . ( ( Patricia Vowinkel 212 - 859 - 1716 ) )

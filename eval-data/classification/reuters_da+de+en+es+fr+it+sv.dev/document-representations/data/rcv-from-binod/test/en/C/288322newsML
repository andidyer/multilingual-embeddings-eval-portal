Russian premier says no power cuts in Kamchatka . Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin vowed on Monday to prevent power cuts in Russia ' s Kamchatka peninsula and promised help after the sinking of a tanker carrying heavy fuel supplies to the far eastern region . " There must be no power and heating cuts in the houses , " Itar - Tass news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying . Tass said Chernomyrdin had ordered the armed forces in the region to spare fuel from their own resources to help local power stations . Moscow had also transferred additional money to the local administration to help out . Earlier on Monday , an official with the local administration said by telephone that partial power cuts to houses and industry would be introduced after Orthodox Christmas on Tuesday . The next heavy fuel delivery to the peninsula was expected on January 17 or 18 , the official said . More than 400 , 000 people live in Kamchatka , which is more than 7 , 000 km ( 4 , 375 miles ) east of Moscow and nine time zones away . The 26 - year - old tanker Nakhodka , carrying 19 , 000 tonnes ( 133 , 000 barrels ) of heavy fuel oil for Kamchatka ' s power stations , was torn into two and sank last Thursday in the Sea of Japan , spilling some of the fuel . The spill threatens rich fishing grounds off Japan ' s main island of Honshu and Japanese maritime authorities made little headway on Monday in their bid to break it up .

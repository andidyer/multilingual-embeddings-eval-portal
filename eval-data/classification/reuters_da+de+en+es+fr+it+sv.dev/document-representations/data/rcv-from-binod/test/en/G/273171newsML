Israel takes shine off Christmas in Bethlehem . Israel has taken some of the shine off festivities in Bethlehem this year , preventing a Finnish Christmas tree from reaching the town of Jesus ' s birth for fear it may spread disease . But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat ' s Christian - born wife restored some light to the PLO - ruled town when she lit a modest local tree at Bethlehem ' s Manger Square to launch official Christmas celebrations . Bethlehem city officials had lit the tree on Sunday but pulled the plug to allow Suha Arafat to officially kick off the holiday season . Holding her baby daughter Zahwa , Suha turned on the lights before television cameras . Palestinian self - rule has reigned in the West Bank town since Israel handed it over to Arafat ' s Palestinian Authority four days before Christmas last year . Israel held up the Finnish tree this year in Haifa port . " The Finns donated a tree that wasn ' t able to get here because the Israeli authorities are blocking it from reaching Bethlehem under the pretext that the tree has some epidemic , " said Jamal Salman , a Bethlehem city official said on Sunday . Palestinians decorated and lit an alternative tree on Sunday after it became clear Israel would not release the 14 - metre ( 46 - foot ) - tall Finnish fir and some 11 , 000 Chinese - made lights to make the Christmas spirit glow in the town of 40 , 000 Christians and Moslems . " There is a special disease in Finland . . . that can damage trees in the whole area , " said Shlomo Dror , spokesman for Israel ' s policy chief in the West Bank and Gaza . He said an electrical problem with the lights could be solved with the help of an engineer but for now they remained held up in port . " Greetings from Finland , the Santa Claus land , " chanted a Finnish Santa , the only Christmas gift from Finland to make it to Bethlehem . He distributed candy to children in front of Bethlehem ' s Church of the Nativity . A Finnish official who attended the first lighting ceremony said Israeli import regulations on live trees were preventing the fir from getting past the northern Israeli port . " It is a cut tree of course , but it is in a way live , " said Jarnosy Rjala , a consul at the Finnish Embassy . " Despite the Israeli complications for the tree and the decorations , the Christmas spirit will prevail in Bethlehem through its Palestinian people . . . and particularly because it is the first anniversary for the liberation of Bethlehem , " said Dawoud Bishara , a Palestinian legislator from the town .

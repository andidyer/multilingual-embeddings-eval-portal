Japan ' s LDP begins policy talks with former allies . Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ' s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) began crucial policy talks with its partners in the current coalition on Saturday in a bid to form a new alliance and secure a parliamentary majority . The LDP was forced to seek coalition partners because it won only 239 seats in last Sunday ' s general elections , one dozen seats short of a majority it needed to govern alone in the powerful 500 - seat Lower House . LDP executives held the first round of policy talks with their counterparts from the Social Democratic Party and the Sakigake party , minority partners in the outgoing government . The LDP also lacks a majority in the 252 - member Upper House with only 109 seats . With 15 seats in the Lower House and 32 in the Upper House , the Social Democrats hold a key to the future structure and strength of Hashimoto ' s government . At the outset of Saturday ' s talks , the Social Democrats presented their tough nine - point policy outline which would serve as the condition for them to join in a new alliance . In their platform , the Social Democrats demanded the LDP agree on an immediate blanket ban on political donations from businesses , a condition that could be too bitter for the pro - business LDP to swallow . The proposal set forth by the Social Democrats included other policy issues such as streamlining the bloated bureaucracy and negotiating with the United States the reduction and withdrawal of U . S . Marines from Japan ' s southernmost island of Okinawa . Sakigake , with just two lower house seats , put out a set of proposals featuring administrative reforms including setting up a cabinet office to take over the compilation of state budget from the Finance Ministry - - its main job - - and privatising government - funded special corporations . The conservative LDP , which has spent most of the past four decades in power , has been helped by political funds from big business , the farm vote and administrative support from bureaucrats . Emerging from the three - party talks , LDP secretary - general Koichi Kato sounded a pessimistic note on the prospects of the Social Democrats joining in the new government . " I certainly feel it difficult for us to secure their cooperation from within the cabinet , " Kato said . If the LDP failed to win the hearts and souls of the two junior parties , it would woo the second largest opposition group , the fledgling Democratic Party , party officials said . The Democratic Party , led by Yukio Hatoyama and Kan Naoto who represent a younger generation of radical reformists , has said it was also against corporate donations for political parties . Analysts said Hashimoto could be forced to lead a weak , minority government which would mean that every piece of legislation , including key budget bills , could easily become bogged down . Top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama has said the government intends to recovene parliament on November 7 to elect a new prime minister , giving the parties less than two weeks to negotiate .

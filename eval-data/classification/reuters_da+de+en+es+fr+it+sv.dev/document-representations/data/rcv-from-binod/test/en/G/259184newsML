Swiss have no visa request from Iraq ' s Uday . Switzerland ' s Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had seen no visa request for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ' s son Uday , who an Arabic newspaper said would be flown to Switzerland for medical treatment after being shot last week . A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Uday could not enter the country without a visa . " We have received no visa request . We have no more information about this matter , " spokesman Hans - Ruedi Bortis told Reuters when asked about a report in the international Arabic newspaper al - Hayat . Al - Hayat , which is based in London , said on Monday that Iraqi authorities had ordered a medivac plane to take Uday to Switzerland for treatment after he was shot and wounded in a Baghdad street last Thursday night . Baghdad would also need permission from the United Nations and the Swiss Foreign Ministry for a flight to Switzerland due to the U . N . - imposed embargo on Iraq , the Swiss Federal Civilian Aviation Agency said . In Geneva , U . N . sources said no Iraqi request for an exemption had been received by the U . N . Sanctions Committee in New York . Saddam ' s half - brother Barzan Ibrahim al - Tikriti is Iraq ' s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva . " I have no information behind what you have heard on the news , " an official answering the phone at the Iraqi diplomatic mission said . Uday is married but separated from one of Barzan ' s daughters , who has returned to live in Geneva with her father , a former head of Iraqi intelligence who maintains cabinet rank as presidential adviser . He was shot in an attack for which an opposition group in exile has claimed responsibility . The Iraqi government says it is investigating but it has not identified the gunmen . Uday , 32 , is being treated at Ibn Sina hospital in Baghdad and according to official accounts his wounds are not serious . However , some diplomats have cast doubt on the official reports . " I think that if he had been just slightly wounded , there would not have been an official communique . It must be serious , " said one diplomat in Geneva .

India turns to deep seas in search of oil and gas . India , faced with stagnant domestic oil production and rising demand , is turning to deep - water exploration to find new oil and gas sources , industry officials said on Tuesday . " The thrust in oil industry is gradually shifting to exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in deep waters , " a petroleum ministry official told Reuters . He said the ministry has committed 65 billion rupees ( $ 1 . 8 billion ) for deep - water oil exploration by state - owned , or partly state - owned , oil firms over a five - year period . " The Brazilians are very successful ( in deep - water oil production ) , " said the official . " They seem to be the most cost - effective and we ' re seeking their collaboration . " Deep - water exploration was the new frontier for India ' s oil prospectors , an official at state - run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) said . India ' s oil production has slowed to below 30 million tonnes a year while annual demand , running at more than 60 million tonnes , has been rising at about eight percent . The bulk of India ' s oil comes from the offshore Bombay High field , but India has no deep - water production . " Large - size discoveries are becoming more and more elusive as easy - to - find oil has already been located , " A . S . Soni , director of operations at ONGC said earlier this month . He said ONGC planned deep - water exploration in four locations on India ' s western and eastern offshore basins . " Based on the data , which is not very exhaustive at the moment , resources of the order of five to nine billion tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas are estimated in deep water areas of 200 to 2 , 000 metres , " Soni said . " Twenty to 35 percent of hydrocarbon potential in India are expected to be in deep waters beyond 200 metres , " an ONGC official said . He said water depths of over 400 metres are now considered as deep waters , against the earlier definition of 200 metres and beyond . The state - run Gas Authority of India Ltd ( GAIL ) has committed funds to jointly scout deep waters , its chairman C . R . Prasad told Reuters on Tuesday . Indian officials are hopeful of finding large gas reserves around the Andaman Islands , off India ' s east coast . Analysts have commended the initiative . " In our view , there should be totally separate legislation for deep water exploration , defined as say below 250 metres , " a recent Kleinwort Benson Securities report on the Indian oil industry said . As a first step , India should study deep - water legislation in other areas of the world to assess the conditions that might attract oil majors to offshore India , the report said .

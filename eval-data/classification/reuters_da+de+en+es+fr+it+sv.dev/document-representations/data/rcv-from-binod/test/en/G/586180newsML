Two members of a German colony surrender in Chile . Two members of a secretive German colony in southern Chile surrendered to police on Wednesday , raising speculation that its fugitive leader may soon turn himself in to face child molestation charges . Gerhard Mucke and Gunther Schaffrick surrendered to police in the southern town of Parral , near Colonia Dignidad ( Dignity Colony ) , a tightly controlled settlement of German immigrants . News reports said Mucke had acted as bodyguard and confidant to the community ' s leader , Paul Schaeffer . Arrest warrants were pending against Mucke and Schaffrick on suspicion of obstruction of justice and child kidnapping , police said . They said the warrants stemmed from an official investigation into accusations of child abuse and kidnapping at the colony , which is tucked in the Andean foothills . The settlement was allegedly used as a military detention and torture centre in the late 1970s under the military government that ran Chile then . The surrender of the two men added to speculation in news media that Schaeffer , object of a police manhunt since last year , might turn himself in to face accusations that he had held boys against their parents ' will and had molested them . The parents of several Chilean boys made the charges , leading to the issuing last year of a warrant for Schaeffer ' s arrest . Lawyers for the colony ' s several hundred inhabitants have dismissed the claims as groundless . " There are no kidnappings . The children were here with the authorisation of their parents , " lawyer Waldo Ortega said in March . Schaeffer , believed to be in his 80s , came to Chile in the 1960s and founded the German - speaking farming colony , which permits few outsiders to visit . The colony , which includes a hospital and boarding school , legally ceased to exist a few years ago but continues to operate under the name Villa Baviera ( Bavarian Town ) .

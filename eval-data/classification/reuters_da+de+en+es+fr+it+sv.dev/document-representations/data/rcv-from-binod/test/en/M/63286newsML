U . S . Treasuries close lower after unfriendly data . U . S . Treasuries closed lower after a batch of unfriendly economic data triggered a new sell - off ahead of the Federal Reserve ' s policy - setting meeting on September 24 , analysts said . The 6 - 3 / 4 percent benchmark 30 - year U . S . Treasury bond ended off 12 / 32 at 96 - 10 / 32 . Its yield remained above the psychological 7 . 0 percent barrier to finish at 7 . 05 percent . Analysts said the proximity of the FOMC meeting has left players more sensitive and the market more inclined to abrupt responses to fresh economic indicators . " There ' s no question that everyone has FOMC on the brain , " said Christopher Low , senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc . " Even with these sort of minor data series showing signs of ( economic ) strength there is going to be selling , and sure enough that was the case today , " Low added . The market ' s data nightmare started early in the day with the release of a surprising 4 . 5 percent jump in housing starts in August to a 1 . 525 million annual rate against a revised 2 . 0 percent drop in July . " Housing was a significant development , " said Josh Stiles , senior bond strategist at consulting firm I . D . E . A . Inc . Analysts said the housing numbers gained special importance given the charateristics of the sector , seen by many as the most sensitive to changes in interest rates . " Housing is a very important , interest - sensitive sector of the economy and it tends to lead the general economy by a quarter or two , " Stiles said . The market also disliked what it saw when the jobless claims figures were released . The Labor Department said claims fell to 329 , 000 in the week ended September 14 from a revised 331 , 000 in the prior week . Analysts said lower claims just confirm the strength seen recently in the labor market . " It ' s not alarming , but it confirms a trend , " a U . S . money trader said about the jobless claims report . Players also expressed concerns about some rising items in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey issued Thursday . They specifically pointed to a jump to 18 . 0 in the prices paid index in September against 4 . 6 in August . The prices received index rose to 4 . 6 in September from a negative 3 . 0 in the previous month . The Philly Fed business outlook index , however , fell to 13 . 9 from 21 . 5 earlier . Analysts said the economic data released on Thursday mildly increased the odds of a hike in short - term interest rates by the Federal Reserve on September 24 . The consensus in the market appears to be leaning towards a Fed tightening , although many still believe the central bank will leave rates unchanged in September . A Reuters survey of economists issued on Thursday showed that 17 of 30 economists expect the Fed to raise rates in September . Of the remaining 13 respondents , seven projected a monetary policy tightening at the November 13 FOMC meeting , one called for a rate hike early next year and five saw the policy unchanged in the foreseable future . The three - month bill rate closed off two basis points at 5 . 10 percent . The six - month bill rate rose one point to 5 . 26 percent . The year bill rate was up two points at 5 . 53 percent . The two - year note closed off 1 / 32 at 99 - 24 / 32 , yielding 6 . 26 percent . The five - year note traded down 4 / 32 at 99 - 14 / 32 to yield 6 . 63 percent . The ten - year note closed off 7 / 32 at 101 - 1 / 32 , yielding 6 . 85 percent . - - 212 - 859 - 1676

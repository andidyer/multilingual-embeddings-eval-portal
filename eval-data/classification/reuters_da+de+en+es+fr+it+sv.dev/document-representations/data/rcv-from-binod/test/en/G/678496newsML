UN Council close to vote on condemning Iraq on arms . The U . N . Security Council was expected to vote on Saturday to condemn Iraq for blocking U . N . arms inspectors and threaten further sanctions if Baghdad does not comply , diplomats said . The new draft resolution was weaker than the United States and Britain had wished when they proposed an immediate travel ban on Iraqi civilian and military officials . But a senior U . S . official said it avoided a Russian veto and accepted " the principle of new sanctions " following a meeting in Denver between U . S . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her Russian and French counterparts . Iraq in the past month has barred arms inspectors , searching for weapons of mass destruction , from three sensitive sites in what some believe is a change of policy towards the Security Council ' s mandates . Baghdad has been under sanctions since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990 . One condition for lifting sanctions on oil exports is to scrap its weapons of mass destruction and related documents . The council maintains U . N . inspectors are to have free access to suspected sites . The U . S . official , speaking from the Group of Seven industrial nations meeting in Denver , said President Bill Clinton spoke to Russian President Boris Yeltsin . Then Albright , fluent in both Russian and French , held a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine , translating the conversation . France would have abstained on the original U . S . - British resolution and China was still expected to do so on the revised draft which " expresses the firm intention to impose additional measures on those categories on Iraqi officials responsible for the non - complance . " It also suspends regular reviews of sanctions until October .

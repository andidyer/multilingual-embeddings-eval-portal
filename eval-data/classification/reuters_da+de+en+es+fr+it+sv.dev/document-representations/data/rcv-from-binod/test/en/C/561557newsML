Foundation Health , Physicians in acquisition talks . Foundation Health Systems Inc . , the country ' s fourth - biggest managed care company , said Tuesday it is in talks to acquire Physicians Health Services Inc . , which serves about 425 , 000 members in the Northeast . Foundation , based in Rancho Cordova , Calif . , said if a definitive deal is reached , the purchase price would be no more than $ 30 per share , which would work out to a total of about $ 279 million . Wall Street analysts said $ 30 a share would be a " full " price for Trumbull , Conn . - based Physicians Health , which has struggled to implement a profitable operating strategy and last year lost close to $ 13 million . Despite the money - losing pattern , analysts said the company could bring Foundation a fairly simple means of advancing its strategy of penetrating the Northeastern market . Foundation , whose operations spread across 19 states in the West , South and Northeast , has considered further penetration in the Northeast as central to its expansion strategy . The managed care style of health care has been particularly slow to catch on in the Northeast , a region where health maintenance organizations still account for less than 25 percent of all health plans , compared with more than 40 percent in Foundation ' s home state of California . " Foundation ' s strategy is to be a fairly aggressive acquiror in the Northeast , " said Volpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney . " Despite Physician Health ' s recent losses , it could be a very profitable source of growth for Foundation . " The main attraction is that it ' s a relatively underpenetrated market . It ' s not that it ' s easier to complete an acquisition there , but the growth prospects are larger . " Keaney said Physicians Health ' s recent problems stemmed mainly from its failure to raise prices and to control medical utilization among members . He said Foundation has demonstrated an ability to control costs , which could help it reverse Physicians ' money - losing pattern . Moreover , said Josephthal Lyon & Ross analyst Mary O ' Connell , industry - wide trends are beginning to improve . " Last year , Physicians saw its margins squeezed in what was a fairly low - margin business to begin with . This year , there is a growing recognition that the underwriting cycle has started to turn . " Physicians Health ' s stock rose $ 3 . 75 to $ 26 . 625 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading . Foundation Health fell 75 cents to $ 27 on the New York Stock Exchange .

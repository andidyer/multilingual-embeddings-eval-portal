Sri Lanka ends power cuts caused by drought . Sri Lanka ' s state power utility said on Tuesday that it would end power cuts after heavy rain in hydropower catchment areas filled some reservoirs to near - spill levels . But the utility will keep the option of re - imposing the existing one - hour - per - week power cut , it said . " We ' ve decided not to impose the power cut if reservoirs are full , " a senior Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) official said . " The announced power cut stands but it will be imposed at our discretion . " Two new thermal power plants expected to ease the Indian Ocean island ' s dependence on hydro power should come on stream early next year , he said . It now depends on hydroelectric generation for 80 percent of its power needs . Sri Lanka was forced to impose daily power cuts of up to eight hours earlier this year after water levels in hydro - reservoirs fell dangerously low with the failure of northeast monsoon and the delayed onset of the southwest monsoon , which normally comes in May . The power cuts were eased last month after heavy rain in catchment areas .

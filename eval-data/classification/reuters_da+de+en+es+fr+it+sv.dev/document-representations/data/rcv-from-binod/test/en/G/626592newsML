Mexico ' s Cardenas calls for pension system boycott . Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , Mexico ' s left - wing candidate for mayor of Mexico City , called on Mexicans to shun the new private pension funds system , the daily Reforma reported in Friday editions . Cardenas , speaking before members of the Social Security Union on Thursday , told Mexicans not to join the Afores system designed to raise levels of national savings , Reforma said . The candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) who is leading in most polls for the July 6 election of the capital , urged workers to leave their retirement contributions in the central bank ' s account for non - affiliated workers . All Mexican workers have the option to join privately operated retirement funds that will start up July 1 or remain in government run plans . Cardenas said his party will promote a " counter reform to the reform " of changes to social security laws that allowed the private sector to set up their own managed funds . " The Afores take over a part of the savings of the worker without giving benefits and the so - called freedom of choice ( to select Afores ) does not exist because eventually the worker is forced to join an Afore and pay a commission , " Cardenas said , according to Reforma .

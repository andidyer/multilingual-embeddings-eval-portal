SIERRA LEONEAN REFUGEES RETURN HOME IN BOATS . Two boats docked in Sierra Leone ' s Freetown on Saturday carrying home 295 refugees who fled years of civil war . The refugees , who sailed from Liberia , returned in the second phase of a U . N . refugee agency plan to repatriate 500 , 000 Sierra Leoneans scattered through neighbouring countries . A gunboat of the Sierra Leone navy arrived with 42 refugees , while another 253 docked on a naval landing craft . A further 233 were expected on Sunday after the fishing trawler carrying them developed engine trouble . A peace accord , signed in Ivory Coast in November , was designed to end a civil war waged since 1991 by Foday Sankoh and his rebels of the Revolutionary United Front . The countryside is generally peaceful , although each side has accused the other of truce violations and banditry is rife . Doctors who treated the new arrivals , most of them women and children , said some of the refugees had malaria and worm infestations , while others were suffering from seasickness and high blood pressure . Many of the refugees said they has suffered hunger , disease and harassment during their stay in Liberia - - itself ravaged by civil war , but now heading tentatively for elections this month . " It is good to be back in my country , " 40 - year - old Momodu Kawa told reporters . " In Monrovia many of us walked 30 km ( 20 miles ) every day to cut wood in the forest for charcoal which we could sell to provide food for our children , " he added . The representative of the U . N . High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , Akilaja Akiwumi , told reporters the repatriation plan would last for two years . According to UNHCR figures there are 340 , 000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea , with 120 , 000 in Liberia and tens of thousands more in Ivory Coast , Mali and Guinea Bissau . " This phase of the exercise will last until July and it is expected that 3 , 000 Sierra Leoneans will be repatriated from Liberia , " Akiwumi said . In February the UNHCR repatriated 1 , 200 Sierra Leoneans from Liberia by sea and air . Sierra Leone , rich in diamonds and other mineral deposits , is one of the world ' s poorest nations .

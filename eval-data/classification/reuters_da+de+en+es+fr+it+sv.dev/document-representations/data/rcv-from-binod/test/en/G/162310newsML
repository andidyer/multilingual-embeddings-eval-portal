Brazil prisoners kill three , hold jailer hostage . Prisoners in a Brazilian jail are holding one prison guard hostage and have killed three detainees after a failed jailbreak attempt , a prison official said on Sunday . A group of prisoners tried unsuccessfully to escape on Sunday , sparking a rebellion involving all 500 detainees at the jail in Praia Grande , a coastal city 50 miles ( 80 kms ) south of Sao Paulo . " For the time being we think at least three prisoners have been killed but we don ' t know for sure as the rebellion is not over yet , " the official said . The prisoners , armed with knives , were demanding the transfer of 15 detainees to another jail , he added . " We are negotiating with them . Yesterday they didn ' t want to go because it was night . Today they don ' t want to go because it is Sunday , " the official said . The three detainees who were killed were part of a group of around 50 prisoners kept in a maximum security area , he added . The rebellion followed another thwarted jailbreak attempt a few days ago in Sao Paulo when four prisoners and a guard were killed when five detainees tried to escape from Carandiru , Latin America ' s largest prison , using a garbage truck .

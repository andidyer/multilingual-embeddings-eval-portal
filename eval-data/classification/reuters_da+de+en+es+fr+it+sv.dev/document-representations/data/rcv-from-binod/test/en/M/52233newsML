LCE cocoa slightly firmer after uneventful session . Cocoa futures perked up slightly on Friday afternoon with the focus on structure play and limited origin activity , traders said . Earlier in the session , some September / March crosses were seen at 40 stg , along with some December crosses , but then March / March interest was reported after the New York open . Traders said one leading market player was trying to keep the structure pinned , supporting the London market . " I think quite a few people are long of the structure and obviously they want it to come back in , " one trader said . " There ' s a little origin activity , some Ivory selling in the wings , but that ' s about it . It ' s really quiet , " he said . At the close the key December contract was three stg firmer at 989 stg after moving in a nine stg range . Most other positions were slightly firmer and overall volume reached a light 2 , 840 lots . Technically , analysts said the market still showed potential for trending higher .

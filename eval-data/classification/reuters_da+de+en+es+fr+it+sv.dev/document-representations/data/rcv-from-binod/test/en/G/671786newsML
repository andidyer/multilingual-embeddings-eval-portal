Main points of EU ' s treaty of Amsterdam . European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday on a revised treaty on European union . Here are the main points : 1 . FREEDOM , SECURITY , JUSTICEThe treaty allows the EU for the first time to suspend the voting rights in the Council of Ministers of any country which persistantly violates basic freedoms . A zone of freedom , security and justice will be created within five years of the treaty ' s entry into force - - probably 2003 given time needed for ratification . Denmark was given an opt - out from the provisions . Freedom of movement of persons is guaranteed throughout the Union , but Britain and Ireland will be allowed to maintain frontier controls . Subject to this opt - out , the contents of the Schengen convention on freedom of movement , including police cooperation , were incorporated into the treaty . Immigration , visa policy , political asylum , civilian judicial cooperation and harmonisation of divorce laws will become common EU policies . Unanimity will be required for decision - making , with a decision in five years on whether to move to qualified majority voting . Judicial cooperation in criminal affairs and police cooperation will remain matters for national governments , which pledge to tighten European cooperation by unanimous decisions . The 15 countries agree to give an operational role to the Europol police agency , embryo of a European police force . 2 . THE UNION AND THE CITIZENAn employment chapter is included in the treaty . The aim is for the Council of Ministers to produce a " coordinated strategy for employment " , as it did for budget deficit cutting in preparation for the single European currency . The Council may make recommendations to member states . Pilot projects can be launched on employment , but at German insistance , they will remain limited . The " social chapter " which Britain refused to have included in the Maastricht treaty in 1991 will be integrated into the new treaty . The text provides for a harmonisation of some social regulations to prevent unfair competition within the single European market . 3 . AN EFFECTIVE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICYCommon strategies will be defined by unanimous decision on issues such as relations with Russia . Member states which do not want to be involved can use " constructive abstention " . These strategies may be implemented by qualified majority voting , but any state which feels its vital interests are threatened can block a decision . The treaty provides for a High Representative to embody the Common Foreign and Security Policy . The role will be held by the secretary - general of the Council , a civil servant and not the high - profile , full - time political figure sought by France . Opposition by Britain and neutral states prevented agreement on merging the Western European Union defence grouping in to the EU . The text speaks of a " possibility of integrating the WEU into the Union , if the European Council so decides " , contrary to the automatic timetable sought by Germany and France . The Union created a planning cell of national diplomats , Council and Commission officials to harmonise positions on foreign policy and improve coherence with EU trade policy . 4 . THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE UNIONThe leaders almost totally failed to advance on this issue . It was agreed in principle that when the Union is enlarged , the big countries would give up one of their two European commissioners so the size of the Brussels executive does not exceed 20 . There would be one commissioner per member state on condition that an agreement was reached on modifying the weighted votes of member states in the Council . When the number of member states goes over 20 , there will be another complete review of EU institutions . 5 . ENHANCED COOPERATION - FLEXIBILITYMember states will be able to move forward in limited areas , using EU institutions , without waiting for all other countries , provided that a qualified majority agrees . In some areas , a unanimous decision will be required for such projects .

Food and medicine rushed to starving Liberians . Relief agencies rushed food and medicine to hundreds of starving children in Liberia on Monday , building on a deal with faction fighters that has opened up the western town of Tubmanburg for the first time since February . Tarek Elguindi , Liberia director of the U . N . World Food Programme ( WFP ) , said a consignment of medicine , beans , oil and sugar had arrived in the jungle town 70 km ( 45 miles ) from the capital Monrovia on Monday and was being distributed . " This is for the most severely malnourished children , " Elguindi told Reuters . An assessment team which visited the town on Saturday estimated their number at 4 , 000 . " With this severe situation we want to distribute in five points simultaneously . We are putting in more people . We have sent a team for logistics , " he added . A food convoy with eight trucks will leave for the town on Tuesday and further convoys will shuttle food in over the next four days . Elguindi estimated the number of people in the town at between 30 , 000 and 35 , 000 . More than six years of civil war have killed well over 150 , 000 people in Liberia , which was founded by freed American slaves in 1847 . Fighting flared in the capital Monrovia in April and May and later in isolated corners of the country . Officials of the Rome - based WFP and other aid agencies took advantage of peace moves in Liberia to enter Tubmanburg , cut off by faction rivalry and associated insecurity since February . The WFP in Rome said over half the town ' s inhabitants were suffering from extreme hunger and hundreds of skeletal children were on the verge of death . " The children have swollen bellies , their eyes are swollen , their skin is cracked , " it said . The town is under the control of the ethnic Krahn ULIMO - J faction loyal to Roosevelt Johnson . West African leaders , frustrated by the collapse of a dozen peace deals , brokered a fresh agreement in August and threatened individual sanctions against any faction leader who derails it . It envisages disarmament of the estimated 60 , 000 fighters by January and presidential and parliamentary elections by May . Faction leader Alhaji Kromah handed heavy weapons to West African peacekeepers in his Voinjama stronghold near the border with Guinea at the weekend and pledged to continue the process . Charles Taylor , who launched the war in 1989 and has the largest force , has pledged to start disarming and demobilising his fighters this month . Both men , vice - chairman on the interim ruling State Council , plan to run for president . Sometime rivals , they fought together against Johnson and a Krahn alliance in Monrovia in April and May . Hundreds died in the fighting and associated looting .

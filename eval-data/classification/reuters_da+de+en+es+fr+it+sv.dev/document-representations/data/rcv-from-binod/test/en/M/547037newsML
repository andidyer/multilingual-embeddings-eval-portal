NYMEX electricity ends up on cash , shortcovering . NYMEX electricity futures finished higher Tuesday on shortcovering before May deliveries and stronger spot physical prices due to firm energy demand in the western U . S . , market sources said . The rise in cash prices was initially triggered by keen buying interest , especially from one Northwest utility , traders said . Cash power values in the West received another boost after Bonneville Power Administration ( BPA ) withdrew offers to sell next - day firm , peak power . BPA announced it will continue to offer next - day firm and non - firm power but only during off - peak demand hours . Monday , the federal agency offered to sell a limited amount of non - firm peak power at $ 13 . 00 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) for Northwest deliveries and $ 14 . 00 for California - Oregon border ( COB ) . Hydroelectric supply was further tightened when Canada ' s B . C . Hydro pulled out of exporting surplus power to the U . S . as reservoir levels at the Arrow Dam in British Columbia approach flood control limits . Next - day electricity prices for peak , firm delivery at COB firmed to $ 17 . 00 - 18 . 00 from Monday ' s $ 15 . 75 - 16 . 50 , and those at the Palo Verde ( PV ) switchyard in Arizona strengthened to $ 18 . 50 - 19 . 50 from $ 16 . 50 - 17 . 00 . June COB futures settled up 85 cents at $ 14 . 15 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) after traded between $ 13 . 80 and $ 14 . 15 . July COB ended up 67 cents at $ 16 . 30 . August and September COB contracts finished 43 cents higher . June Palo Verde ( PV ) futures settled up 57 cents at $ 18 . 85 after bouncing between $ 18 . 40 and 18 . 90 . July PV ended up 40 cents at $ 23 . 20 . Deferred PV months finished 30 - 40 cents higher . Separately , a 550 megawatt ( MW ) unit at the Jim Bridger coal - fired generating complex in Wyoming is expected to reconnect to the power grid Thursday after being taken offline last week for unplanned repairs , market sources said . In the Northwest , temperatures would stay four to eight degrees Fahrenheit below normal through Wednesday and moderate to normal to four degrees below normal Thursday into the weekend . Unstable atmospheric conditions could bring chance of rain along the coast and in the mountains . In the Southwest , dry and mild weather would settle over the southern part of the region for the rest of the week with readings averaging three to five degrees F above normal . Cloudy skies and slightly cooler - than - normal weather were predicted for Utah , Colorado and northern California . NYMEX estimated 397 COB and 216 PV contracts were sold .

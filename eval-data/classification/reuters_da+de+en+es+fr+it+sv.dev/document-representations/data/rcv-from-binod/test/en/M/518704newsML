Europe cash cocoa buyers retreat as market firms . European buyers of cash cocoa have retreated this week in the face of a slightly higher market and continued strength in sterling against European currencies . Continental traders reported pockets of physical business early in the week for nearby Ivorian beans , trading at 25 to 35 stg under the terminal market but volumes were very light . " We ' re back to a wait - and - see market . There are too many variables out there for the industry , " one trader said . London - traded futures were trading around 1 , 030 stg a tonne on Thursday , about 10 stg lower than a week ago . But there was little business seen for delivery dates further out with traders citing little demand unless very cheap cocoa was offered . " You have to be offering beans at 35 stg under for later this year to get any interest at all , " one said . Ivorian shippers , who have been offering cheap cocoa below levels in the second hand market , had largely ceased selling , having reportedly made large profits earlier in the year . Traders said worries over the size and availability of the Ivory Coast ' s mid - crop was causing buyer reluctance , heightened by what U . S . trade house Phibro , thought to be holding a massive physical position , may be planning over the summer months . " Industry is waiting but it ' s an old habit and despite the fundamentals they are betting prices will be easing , " one said . Contradictory weather reports in the Ivory Coast are also making for uncertain trading with market sources saying the latest reports of showers in the region seemed to indicate that fears of a badly damaged crop have been overdone . But there is talk of a mid - crop with a smaller bean size . " A large part of the crop might not make it to the terminal and that will play into Phibro ' s hands and there ' ll be a chance of a squeeze on September , " one continental European trader commented . Some London - based traders have this week cited a possible rally up to around 1 , 050 stg over the summer and pointed to the inverted structure of the futures market as a sign of potential tightness . On Thursday , July was trading at a 16 - stg premium to the December against a 12 - stg discount the week before . According to the latest figures from warehousing firm SGS Europe , cocoa stocks in western European are continuing to climb . Data show inventories in Amsterdam alone at the start of the month at way above 600 , 000 tonnes . But physical traders said that may not tell the whole story . " Everybody knows there ' s a lot of cocoa around at the moment but the question is how much of it is available , " one said . - - Amsterdam Newsroom + 31 20 504 5000

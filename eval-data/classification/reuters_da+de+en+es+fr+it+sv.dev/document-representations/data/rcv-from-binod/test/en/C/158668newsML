Shenzhen cracks down on firms delaying repayment . Shenzhen has launched a crackdown on enterprises that delay bank loan repayments for a long time , the Shenzhen - based Securities Times said on Thursday . The Shenzhen People ' s Intermediate Court has punished a number of firms which had long delayed repayment and had no intention of paying and recently issued warnings to more than 40 defaulters , the newspaper said . Since 1996 , the Shenzhen court has handled nearly 200 such cases involving more than 800 million yuan , sharply higher than in previous years , it said without giving comparative figures . The sharply higher figure was due to those firms ' poor management and wrong investment strategies which made them unable to repay loans on time , the newspaper said . Some firms spent the loans carelessly , while some officials turned a blind eye to the creditworthiness of some enterprises because they have special relationship with them , it said . In October , the court settled a total of about 60 such cases involving a total of about 225 million yuan , the paper said . Non - performing loans account for about 13 - 14 percent of total loans outstanding in China ' s banking system , central bank spokesman Ma Delong said on Wednesday . Ma said about two to three percent of total loans are viewed as bad debts that would never be recovered .

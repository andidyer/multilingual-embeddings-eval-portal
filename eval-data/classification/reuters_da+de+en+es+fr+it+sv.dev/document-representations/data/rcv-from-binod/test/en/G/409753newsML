CRICKET - RAIN DELAYS 4TH NEW ZEALAND - ENGLAND ONE - DAY MATCH . Rain delayed the start of play in the fourth one - day cricket international between New Zealand and England at Eden Park on Saturday . England hold a 2 - 0 lead in the five - match series after winning the first and second games . The third , in Napier last Wednesday , ended in a tie . New Zealand must win this match and the final game at Wellington on Tuesday to square the series . It was a humid , cloudy morning in Auckland on Saturday but the rain had stopped by the scheduled start time of 10 . 30 a . m . ( 2130 GMT ) . Match officials were hopeful play could start at 11 . 30 a . m . if there is no further rain . That would mean a minor reduction in overs , with a reduced lunch break to compensate for lost time . But the weather forecast was not good , with more rain expected during the day . If the match is not completed on Saturday , it will be played on Sunday ' s reserve day .

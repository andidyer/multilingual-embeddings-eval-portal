Frost sees signs of petrol price war pause . Frost Group Plc , a David among Goliaths in the British petrol price war , said it might well end 1996 as the only profitable company in the UK fuels retailing market amid signs of competition becoming less intense . " We are well positioned relative to the other 20 or so smaller suppliers pitted against the might of Esso , Shell and BP in a fight for a place in a market that will be stronger , healthier and more profitable , " said chairman James Frost . Frost Group earlier reported first - half down 32 . 9 percent to 3 . 8 million stg amid an industry restructuring initiated by Exxon ' s Esso Price Watch Scheme last year , the fuels group said . " I am pleased to report results in line with market expectations , " Frost said . Despite the profit drop , Frost Group left its dividend unchanged at 3 . 2 pence per share . " In view of the earnings cover and the indication of an improving climate , the board has decided to maintain the dividend as last year , " Frost said in a statement , adding that the latest round of price rises appears to be holding . But the restructuring in the British petrol market is not over yet and Frost said his group will seek to shed sites , which do not have healthy long - term prospects . " The war will end when Esso wants it to end - after all it was Esso who started it in September 1995 , " Frost said . Frost Group , which took over the British fuels operations of Burmah Castrol last year , said it was Britain ' s fourth biggest motor fuels retailer by site numbers . Only Esso , Royal Dutch / Shell Group and British Petroleum are bigger . But the number of privately owned sites supplied by Frost is expected to fall to about 250 to 300 from 500 now and 807 at the time of the Burmah acquisition , Frost said . Shares in Frost Group eased 0 . 5 pence to 120 pnece in late morning trade . - - London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7717

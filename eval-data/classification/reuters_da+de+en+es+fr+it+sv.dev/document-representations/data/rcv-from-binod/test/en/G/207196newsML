Hindu nationalists paralyse Indian parliament . India ' s right - wing Hindu opposition party forced the adjournment of parliament for the second consecutive day on Thursday with a noisy protest over the political impasse in the country ' s most populous state . Both upper and lower houses of parliament were adjourned for the day after irate members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) demanded immediate debate on the logjam in Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) . " Democracy has been murdered in UP , " BJP leader M . M . Joshi shouted in the lower house , or Lok Sabha , which was adjourned until Friday after protesting BJP members prevented any business from being transacted . The BJP emerged as the biggest single party in recent state assembly elections but fell short of an outright majority . Prime Minister H . D . Deve Gowda ' s United Front coalition came in second , and the Congress party , allied with a regional party representing the lowest Hindu castes , came in third . Congress , which is providing critical support to Deve Gowda ' s coalition in the federal parliament but has not joined the government , had demanded that the United Front support its candidate for the position of Uttar Pradesh chief minister . But the United Front declined , stoking tension with Congress . Then last month , President Shankar Dayal Sharma imposed federal rule over the state after the sparring parties were unable to form a local government . " This is a conspiracy at the national level not to allow the BJP to form the government in UP , " BJP deputy Pramod Mahajan said on the floor of the Lok Sabha . The BJP has promised to continue to disrupt parliament during its month - long winter session , which began on Wednesday , unless it is given a chance to form a government in Uttar Pradesh , home to some 140 million people .

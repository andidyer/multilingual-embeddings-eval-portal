Irish pound firms as short positions closed . The Irish pound firmed against sterling and the mark as the market absorbed the closure of two large short positions taken out in recent weeks , dealers said . " It ' s as simple as that . A couple of big shorts against the punt are being closed out , " Ulster Bank economist Eoin Fahy said . By 0916 GMT the Irish pound was seen at 0 . 9315 sterling and 2 . 6296 marks against a Thursday close of 0 . 9297 and 2 . 6206 . The Irish unit gained sharply on Thursday because of market speculation that it might be revalued in the ERM grid , possibly by an emergency meeting of EU Finance Ministers at the weekend . But dealers said such speculation had now been discounted and there was nothing to substantiate talk of such a meeting ahead of next week ' s EU summit in Amsterdam . " Rumours of a revaluation in the Irish pound surfaced once again yesterday . However , these are unfounded , " AIB economist John Beggs said . Dealers said the revaluation speculation had helped stem a wave of selling of the Irish currency which began at the end of April and continued throughout last month . According to such speculation , the Irish unit would have to be revalued because the government wanted it closer to its central rate in the ERM grid of 2 . 41 marks , which would have entailed a drop of some 17 pfennigs . But the revaluation talk along with doubts over EMU helped reverse the fall and lift the Irish unit on Thursday above 2 . 62 marks for the first time since April . " The Central Bank and others sparked talk of a revaluation and until then the Irish unit was seen as a one - way bet going down , " Fahy told Reuters . " But it is highly unreasonable to believe in a revaluation in the short term , " he added . Dealers said the likelihood of a revaluation being agreed or negotiated by Ruairi Quinn was especially unlikely since he is only acting Finance Minister until a new cabinet is appointed in coming days after the government was voted out on June 6 . Bertie Ahern , leader of the Fianna Fail party , has yet to name his team , which will replace the centre - left government of Prime Minister John Bruton . - - Dublin newsroom + 353 - 1 - 6613377

Canada farmers vote to retain CWB barley monopoly . Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale announced Tuesday that Canadian farmers had voted to retain the Canadian Wheat Board ' s monopoly on exports of malt and feed barley . " This does not mean , however , that our overall system of marketing western grain can be static or frozen . This vote was taken in the context of the changes we are proposing through Bill C - 72 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act , " he said . He said the vote was 62 . 9 percent in favor of retaining the monopoly . The CWB ' s barley export monopoly was criticized when spot prices at U . S . border elevators exceeded its monthly offers in 1995 . About 76 , 000 eligible Prairie barley farmers were asked to choose either of the following options . Open Market Option : Remove all barley from the CWB and place it entirely on the open market for all domestic and export sales . Single - Seller Option : Maintain the CWB as the single - desk seller for all barley with the continuing exception of feed barley sold domestically . The mail - in vote was held between January 23 and March 7 . The CWB held an 11 percent share of the world feed barley market in 1995 / 96 ( Aug / July ) or 906 , 000 tonnes to market that traded 8 . 4 million tonnes , CWB spokesman Jim Pietryk said . It held a 37 . 5 percent share of the world malting barley market , selling 1 . 426 million tonnes to a market that traded 3 . 8 million tonnes , Pietryk said . The CWB exports about a third of Prairie barley output while the remainder is sold privately to livestock feedlots or sold by the CWB to domestic maltsters . ( ( Gilbert Le Gras 204 947 3548 ) )

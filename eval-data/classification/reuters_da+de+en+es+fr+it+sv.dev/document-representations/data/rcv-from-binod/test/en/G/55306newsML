Gaelic Games - All - Ireland football final ends drawn . A last - minute point from defender Colm Coyle earned Meath a dramatic draw with Mayo on a scoreline of 0 - 12 to 1 - 09 in the final of the 1996 All - Ireland football championship on Sunday . The final will be replayed at Croke Park on September 29 . Coyle , who had moved into an attacking position only minutes earlier as Meath looked for a match - saving score , picked up a pass 35 - yards out and kicked a high ball towards Mayo ' s goal . The ball landed 10 - yards out but bounced up off the dry pitch and over the crossbar to complete a brave Meath comeback . Meath , who have made a habit in recent times of staging late rallies to win or draw matches they looked like losing , had found themselves six points behind Mayo when they conceded a soft goal with 25 minutes remaining . There seemed little danger as Meath defender Paddy Reynolds , acting as a sweeper , moved across from his own position on the left wing to pick up a stray Mayo pass . But Reynolds stumbled over the ball as he bent down to pick it up and Mayo forward Ray Dempsey was in quickly to take the ball on a few yards in the style of a soccer player before he coolly slotted the ball wide of Meath goalkeeper Conor Martin . Reynold ' s goal had Mayo ahead 1 - 08 ( 11 ) to 0 - 05 ( 5 ) . But Meath threw caution to the wind for the last 24 minutes of the match and , with defenders joining the forwards at every opportunity , attacked the Mayo goal in large numbers . Their bravery was rewarded as they kicked seven points , as against only one for Mayo , over the final 20 minutes of action to earn a replay in a fortnight ' s time . In the end , Meath were most grateful to forward Trevor Giles who kicked six of his side ' s 12 - point total . His scores had kept the Leinster champions in touch with Mayo at times when they looked like they might be overwhelmed . Connacht champions Mayo , who won the last of their three All - Ireland titles in 1951 and had suffered a 20 - point defeat by Cork on their last championship appearance at Croke Park in 1993 , showed no signs of nerves early on . Midfielders Liam McHale and David Brady were quick to assert their dominance over the Meath midfield partnership of Jimmy McGuinness and John McDermott . McHale and Brady used their possession well , supplying the Mayo forwards with good ball . Kicked points by forwards James Horan and Colm McMenamon , who played a roving role throughout the game , had Mayo two points ahead by the 10th minute . Meath drew level by the 15th minute , with a kicked point from forward Graham Geraghty and a free from Giles , but it was clear they had already become frustrated with Mayo ' s tight marking and the struggle to win possession in midfield . This frustration ultimately led to a booking for Meath forward Barry Callaghan , who caught Mayo defender James Nallen with a high and dangerously late challenge , and to a fist fight involving about six players from each team . The fighting over , Mayo settled down again to the task in hand and they added five points to their tally over the final 16 minutes of the first - half . Giles added two points , one of which came from a free , to Meath ' s tally over the same period to keep his side within a goal of Mayo at 0 - 07 to 0 - 04 at half - time . Meath had a goal chance in the 31st minute when Geraghty , who had previously spent time on a trial with English premier division club Arsenal , showed his soccer skills as he made room for a shot which Mayo goalkeeper John Madden did well to save . Mayo extended their lead in the 37th minute when forward Maurice Sheridan pointed a free but Brendan Reilly replied with a point for Meath three minutes later to again leave just a goal between the teams . The Connacht champions could not shake off the Meathmen . Even when Dempsey pounced for the only goal of the game to give Mayo a six point lead , Meath held their composure and battled away until they had succeeded in drawing level .

Yen / Aussie samurai trend seen ending - mkt sources . Despite the Australian dollar ' s renewed bullishness and a tightening of that country ' s interest rates , the trend to issue yen / Aussie dollar dual samurais will be short - lived , underwriting sources said on Tuesday . " The uptrend in Australian interest rates has made it possible to offer higher coupons in yen / Aussie issues , but this is not expected to be a key trend like we ' ve seen last year , " one senior underwriter at a major brokerage house said . The yen / Aussie samurai has been the main object of recent investment by retail investors . In 1996 , of a record 2 . 4 trillion yen worth of dual currency samurais issued , about 70 to 80 percent were yen / Aussie . Meanwhile , the Aussie dollar has been boosted by a basically solid Australian economy and high interest rates which lure investment from overseas . The Aussie stood at 97 . 50 yen in Tuesday ' s Tokyo afternoon , compared to about 95 yen a month ago . Latest 10 - year bond yields in Australia stood at 7 . 97 percent , compared to 6 . 72 percent in the United States and Japan ' s 2 . 28 percent . " With the expectation of the Aussie climbing above 100 yen soon , we may see some more yen / Aussie samurai issues if the currency continues climbing as expected , " he said . But last week ' s DSL Bank Deutsche Siedlungs - und Landesrentenbank launch of 30 billion yen worth of yen / Aussie dual currency samurai bonds was only the second yen / Aussie dual samurai bond launched this year after New South Wales Treasury Corp launched its samurai bond in early January . " Considering that interest rates in the United States are on an upward trend , the issuance in Aussie is unlikely to be as big as last year unless interest rates in Australia start growing in a faster pace , " one underwriter said . Underwriters said yen / U . S . dollar issues will continue to be popular considering the liquidity and stability of the U . S . dollar . - - Chikafumi Hodo , Tokyo Treasury Desk 3432 - 8785

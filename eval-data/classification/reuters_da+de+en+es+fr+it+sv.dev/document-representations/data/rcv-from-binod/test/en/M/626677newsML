" The ( Shenzhen ) markets have been so volatile lately and no one wants to bet on the government ' s next move , " a trader at China Southern Securities said . Beijing ' s measures to cool the markets at the start of May and rumours of further moves sent A and B share indices into a tailspin .

Jinan Qingqi issued its B shares on Thursday and Friday at a price of $ 0 . 482 per share . Brokers said major investors had shifted most of their capital into buying the new B shares , resulting in today ' s extremely low volume . " Market sentiment seems stable on some institutional support for big firms , and the A share rebound late in the session also triggered some retail investors ' buying , which pushed the ( Shanghai ) index up , " one broker said . The Shanghai A index ended up 23 . 217 points or 1 . 76 percent to 1 , 341 . 862 points on volume of 327 . 7 million shares worth 5 . 4 billion yuan . The SSE30 blue chip index moved up 40 . 005 points or 1 . 02 percent to 3 , 953 . 159 points .

Picnics , reciprocal ship tours , receptions and a joint band concert have been planned . Officials from both navies said in speeches they hope the visit will be the start of a new era of understanding . According to Lt . Jeff Davis of the U . S .

American warships have visited Chinese ports over the past two years . The Chinese will depart on Wednesday for San Diego , where the ships will be in port from March 21 to 25 .

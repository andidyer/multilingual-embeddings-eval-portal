NBA BASKETBALL - Utah one win from Finals after Game 5 victory . Karl Malone scored 29 points and pulled down 14 rebounds to lead the Utah Jazz within one win of their first trip to the NBA Finals with a 96 - 91 victory over the Houston Rockets on Tuesday . The Jazz lead the best - of - seven Western Conference finals three games to two and can play for the championship for the first time in the 23 - year history of the franchise with a win in Game Six at Houston on Thursday . John Stockton overcame foul trouble to score 17 points for the Jazz , who improved to 8 - 0 at home in the post - season . The home team has won all five games in the series but Houston must win at home Thursday and Game Seven on the road to earn a return to the Finals . The Rockets were NBA champions in 1994 and 1995 . " We do have a different team than we had when we had championships , " Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said . " But every task that we have faced so far , I felt that when ( we were ) really backed into the corner , we responded . " Malone bounced back from a bad shooting performance in Utah ' s Game Four loss , and in the marquee matchup of the series , he held Charles Barkley to just 10 points . " Karl stepped up tonight and played really well , " Stockton said . In the second half , Malone outscored Barkley 19 - 4 , holding him to one point in the fourth quarter . Malone , who was named the league ' s Most Valuable Player this season , and Stockton combined for 14 points in the final 10 minutes as Utah held off several Houston rallies . Hakeem Olajuwon scored 33 points and Clyde Drexler added 15 for the Rockets . " You ' re not going to stop Olajuwon , " Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said . " I haven ' t seen anybody do it yet and we certainly aren ' t going to . " The Rockets lost the lead midway through the second quarter and never regained it , falling behind 47 - 44 at halftime . The Rockets trailed by seven points entering the final period and pulled no closer than five in the final eight minutes . Bryon Russell scored 13 points , Jeff Hornacek added 11 and Antoine Carr and Howard Eisley added 10 apiece off the bench for the Jazz , who shot 49 percent ( 34 - of - 69 ) from the field and made 25 - of - 28 free throws . Matt Maloney made four three - pointers and scored 14 points for the Rockets , who shot 45 percent ( 30 - of - 67 ) , including 7 - of - 24 from behind the arc . " They made some runs and we hung in there , " Maloney said . " We just didn ' t get over that hump and come back . We were just one more run away . They made some big shots . " After scoring 10 points on 4 - of - 11 shooting in the first half , Malone came alive in the third quarter , scoring 11 points and picking up the slack for Stockton , who drew his fourth foul with 8 : 50 left and went to the bench . " It is always tough to sit on the sideline and watch when it is an important game , " Stockton said . " You want to be out there . " A three - pointer by Houston ' s Sedale Threatt cut the deficit to 73 - 70 with 9 : 57 remaining , but Malone answered with a basket . Olajuwon hit a jumper , but Stockton made a foul - line jumper and a pair of free throws to boost Utah ' s lead back to seven at 79 - 72 with 8 : 37 to play . A layup by Stockton gave Utah its largest lead at 87 - 78 with 5 : 40 left , but Houston got within five at 92 - 87 before Hornacek banked in a tough drive to give the Jazz a 94 - 87 lead with 2 : 06 remaining . " They really didn ' t score much down the stretch . We just couldn ' t score , " Barkley said .

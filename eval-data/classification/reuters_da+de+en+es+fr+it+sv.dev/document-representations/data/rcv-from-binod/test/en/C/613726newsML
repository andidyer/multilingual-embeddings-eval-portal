Guatemala says telephone sale done in three months . The Guatemalan government said late Sunday it expects to complete the sale of state telephone company GUATEL by August . " In the next 15 days we will call on those interested to participate in the purchase of GUATEL , " GUATEL manager Fredy Guzman said in a news conference . Earlier this month GUATEL began a road show , promoting the company to interested foreign buyers , he said . Among the companies visited were Telefonos de Mexico ( Telmex ) , MCI Communications Corp , GTE Corp , in addition to French , Italian and Spanish companies , Guzman said . JP Morgan is aiding GUATEL in the sale , he added . The government is advancing in the privatization despite strong opposition from unions and opposition parties , who appealed the sale to the Supreme Court . Guatemala plans to privatize telecommunications and electricity generation as part of a new law , which has been controversial since it did not require approval by Congress . Income from the sales are said to be destined for social development programs and to reduce domestic debt levels equivalent to about $ 1 billion in 1996 .

Estonian leader names premier from CoalitIon ranks . President Lennart Meri on Thursday named Mart Siiman , a leading minority government politician , as Estonia ' s new prime minister , and western diplomats in Tallinn predicted little change in the Baltic state ' s economic reform programme . Siiman , 50 , at present heads the parliamentary faction of the Coalition Party , the biggest grouping in the government . He has 14 days to form a government and present it to parliament , Meri ' s office said . Siiman ' s party said talks would start later to see if the present minority government could attract other parties . " We expect to begin talks tonight with other political parties , " Coalition Party secretary - general Neeme Jogi said . Siiman , who has a reputation as a behind - the - scenes operator , is taking over from Tiit Vaehi , a veteran Coalition Party politician who had been in office since April 1995 . Vaehi stepped down after only narrowly winning a parliament no - confidence vote earlier this month amid allegations that he took part in shady privatisation deals . Estonia is currently ruled by a minority administration of the Coalition Party and a bloc of rural parties , which commands the firm support of 41 seats in the 101 - seat house . Siiman , a television and radio manager from the pre - Soviet and post - Soviet era , believes he can muster the support of two thirds of the legislature . But it remained unclear whether other parties would join the government , although informal talks have already been held . The Reform Party , the main opposition grouping and formerly a part of Vaehi ' s coaltion , said it was ready to join the consultations . " We are waiting and we hope the negotiations will be fruitful and that Estonia will achieve greater political stability , " Reform Party secretary - general Heiki Kranich said . Political analysts and diplomats said there were unlikely to be radical changes under a Siiman - led government . " There is no reason to think Siiman as prime minister will change economic or foreign policy , " a diplomat from a European Union country told Reuters . Despite frequent bouts of political turmoil , Estonia has managed to carry on economic reforms and a speedy privatisation programme since leaving the former Soviet Union in 1991 . It is the smallest of the Baltic states with a population of 1 . 5 million but has attracted much foreign investment , particularly from Finland , just 80 km ( 50 miles ) to the north .

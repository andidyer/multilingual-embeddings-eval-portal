Australia ' s BHP wipes slate clean as profit dives . Australia ' s largest listed company , The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd ( BHP ) , on Friday reported a plunge in net annual profit in a result battered by huge one - off losses . The steel , mining and petroleum group announced a 60 . 8 percent fall in earnings after abnormal items to just A $ 410 million ( US $ 307 million ) for the year ended May 31 , after slicing over A $ 800 million from the value of its global assets . But the write - downs , including A $ 550 million at its North American copper assets , masked an improvement in underlying pre - abnormal earnings , which rose seven percent . The share market warmed to the result , especially BHP ' s move to cut its underperforming assets down to size . Investors sent BHP shares nine cents higher on the day to close at A $ 19 . 15 . " They have certainly wiped the slate clean , " a Melbourne analyst told Reuters . BHP swallowed almost A $ 1 billion in net abnormal losses for the year , including A $ 220 million for restructuring its steel division and major write - downs of minerals and petroleum assets . " I am confident we are laying the foundation for a better result going foward , " BHP managing director John Prescott told a news conference . Share analysts agreed . They began revising their BHP profit forecasts for 1997 / 98 closer to A $ 2 billion before one - off items , due to a much lower depreciation charge on the trimmed - down asset base and signs of an upturn in the company ' s copper and steel businesses . Before the profit announcement , analysts were expecting BHP to report net earnings of around A $ 1 . 9 billion in 1997 / 98 . Prescott said no more abnormal asset write - downs would be made in 1997 / 98 . But question marks still remained over some of BHP ' s assets , including some of the North America copper mines bought only 18 months ago when BHP paid US $ 2 . 4 billion for the Magma Copper Co . Prescott glaringly omitted the Magma assets in outlining BHP ' s " key , core assets " on Friday . BHP is the world ' s second largest producer of copper . Prescott listed BHP ' s core assets as the low - cost Escondida copper mine in Chile , oil and gas fields in Australian waters , parts of its steel division and its iron ore and coal business . The rest he classed as second - league assets which could be considered for sale to the highest bidder . " We will develop on busineses in group two , but there were some that were there a little while ago that are not there now , and there are others that may be sold , " he said . One analyst said he expected BHP to announce asset sales to the tune of around A $ 1 . 5 billion over the next 10 months , mainly from the minerals division . Some of the Magma mines might also be sold , he added . Another brokerage analyst , who declined to be named , said BHP could not claim to have really fixed its balance sheet until it had sold some underperforming assets . " It ' s not all over , " he said . ( A $ 1 = US $ 0 . 75 )

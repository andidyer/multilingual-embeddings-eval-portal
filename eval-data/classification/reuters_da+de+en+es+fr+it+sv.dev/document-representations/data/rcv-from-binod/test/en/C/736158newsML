PS New Mexico boosts wholesale sales . Public Service Co of New Mexico said Wednesday it took advantage of opportunities in the wholesale power market to boost kilowatt hour wholesale sales by 82 . 3 percent during the second quarter . Although the number of competitors has increased dramatically , the utility said , its marketing program aimed at providing specialized energy products tailored to customer demand resulted in a dramatic increase in sales and revenues . While total electric revenues were up 7 . 7 percent for the quarter , wholesale revenues were up $ 13 . 6 million or 56 . 6 percent compared with the same period last year . The company said retail electric sales were off 1 . 1 percent in the second quarter due to cooler temperatures compared with the same three months last year . Total electric sales were up 27 . 9 percent over the same quarter last year , due to the substantial growth in sales for resale during the period . A net increase in interest income for the quarter as a result of the company ' s repurchase of $ 200 million in Palo Verde Lease Obligation Bonds was somewhat offset by increased interest expense due to the use of $ 100 million in short - term debt to help finance that bond repurchase . PS New Mexico said the net effect of these transactions was to increase earnings by $ 0 . 02 per share for the quarter . The company reported profits for the latest quarter of $ 0 . 37 compared with $ 0 . 32 in 1996 ' s second quarter . ( ( - - New York Newsdesk 212 859 - 1610 ) )

Road congestion hurting chemical industry - survey . Road congestion and other transport problems are costing Britain ' s chemical industry around 200 million stg a year , the Chemical Industries Association ( CIA ) said on Thursday . The CIA said ten major chemical companies surveyed in the north - east of England , the heart of the UK ' s chemical industry , estimated annual losses between them of 14 million stg due to transport delays . " For too many years now we have been faced with a heavily congested road network and an overpriced rail freight service , " CIA director of business and environment David Culpin said . The CIA said roads accounted for 81 percent of UK freight transport , with just five percent transported by rail and the rest by pipeline or water . It said rail use had declined because of steep price increases and environmental restrictions . However the survey found that " companies are considering using rail more than at present because of congestion on roads , increases in vehicle excise duty and fuel prices and the introduction of road pricing .

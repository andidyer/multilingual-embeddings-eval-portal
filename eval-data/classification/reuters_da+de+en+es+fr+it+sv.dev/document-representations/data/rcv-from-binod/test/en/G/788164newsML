India , Pakistan activists plan joint celebrations . Performing artists and activists from India and Pakistan will meet at the border next week on the 50th independence anniversary of the two nations in a symbolic gesture of reconciliation , organisers said on Friday . Human rights activists in the northern city of Amritsar said that Citizens for Democracy ( CFD ) and the South Asian Fraternity ( SAF ) would hold a candlelight vigil and a cultural show near the Wagah border in India on August 14 and 15 . Pakistan was formed at midnight on August 14 , 1947 , 24 hours before India attained independence from British rule . About 150 Indians will leave by train for the Pakistani city of Lahore , 100 km ( 60 miles ) from Amritsar , on August 11 and return on August 14 with 120 Pakistanis after celebrating Pakistan ' s independence day . They will cross the border in the Punjab region , where large numbers of Hindus and Moslems were massacred during the partition of the subcontinent . Activists from both countries will light candles and torches at 10 p . m . ( 1630 GMT ) on August 14 , and artists and speakers from both sides of the border will present classical and folk dances in ceremonies lasting until the midnight of August 15 . The governments of both countries had given the go - ahead , they said . India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence . Two have been over disputed Jammu and Kashmir , the only Moslem majority state of secular but largely Hindu India . Islamic Pakistan disputes the territory , and this has been the main bone of contention between the two countries .

Kohl ' s CDU and SPD post modest gains in Hesse - TV . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats both recorded modest gains in local elections in the state of Hesse on Sunday , a computer projection by ZDF television said . The network said that the CDU gained 1 . 3 points to 33 . 3 percent while the SPD posted a slightly stronger gain of 1 . 8 percent to 38 . 2 percent . The smaller parties the Greens , Free Democrats ( FDP ) and far - right Republicans suffered losses . In the statewide projection , the Greens slipped 0 . 7 points to 10 . 2 percent , the FDP dropped to 4 . 0 percent from 5 . 1 percent in 1993 and the Republicans declined to 5 . 6 percent from 8 . 3 percent . The vote in Hesse , one of Germany ' s wealthiest states with 4 . 5 million eligible voters , was dominated by local issues but was expected to have national implications because it is one of only two elections in Germany this year . Kohl has already called the Hesse poll an important foretaste for the parliamentary elections due in late 1998 . Both CDU and SPD leaders in Hesse said they were pleased with the early projections .

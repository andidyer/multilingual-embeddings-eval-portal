Dutch shares end mixed , flutter on Greenspan . Dutch shares closed mixed on Thursday , retreating from early session highs on nervousness ahead of testimony to the US Senate from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan , and then rallying once his remarks were published . The AEX share index closed 2 . 46 points higher at 675 . 09 , falling back from the early 678 . 43 high , which was inspired by Wednesday ' s 85 - point Wall Street gain , on apprehension that Greenspan might point towards tighter US monetary policy . In the event markets rallied as Greenspan did not mention current economic conditions and said the U . S . consumer price index overstated inflation by 0 . 5 - 1 . 5 percentage points a year . " Our initial feeling is that Mr Greenspan ' s remarks are mildly bullish . He doesn ' t accept that inflation is really as high as the CPI figures we get every month , " said a dealer . " Most people think inflation ' s rather high in the States - - so this doesn ' t add weight to the idea that the US economy is overheating at the moment , " he said . Other dealers said the session ' s volatility had pointed towards underlying nervousness about the trend of US interest rates ahead of a Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week . " The market isn ' t really all that strong at the moment , it ' s beginning to lack direction , " a dealer said . " Every one is looking to the U . S . right now and this market is looking very volatile , " said one dealer . " The institutions are doing nothing and most of the movements you ' re seeing are on very thin turnover , " a dealer said . Recent record highs followed by choppy trading on Wall Street have sounded warning bells among some investors here who are concerned a major shake - out could be on the way . " There ' s a lot of cash around which is why the market here seems to pop up every time there ' s a dip , " said a trader , adding that while many in the markets anticipated a drop , stock pickers had moved in to take up perceived underperformers .

Bankgesellschaft 96 profit slumps , sees improvement . Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG , the state - owned German bank , on Friday reported a slump in net profit to 47 million marks ( $ 27 . 3 million ) in 1996 from 476 million due to a surge in risk provisions . But Bankgesellschaft , Germany ' s sixth largest listed bank , said it was keeping its dividend unchanged at 1 . 10 marks because it expected earnings to stabilise in 1997 . Profit was hit by a sharp rise in the need for loan loss provisions , Bankgesellschaft said in a mandatory statement released after a supervisory board meeting . The slump came as no surprise to the stock market after the bank said in December it was setting aside 2 . 2 billion marks to cover problem loans amid an economic downturn in its home region of Berlin and east Germany . The bank ' s shares even bucked a decline in the overall share market to trade up 0 . 3 percent or 0 . 10 marks at 32 . 80 marks in after - bourse dealing after the results . Germany ' s top five banks were all lower as the sector has fallen out of favour with investors after a surge in recent months . Operating profit after risk provisions fell to 355 million marks from 958 million marks . Before risk provisions , operating profit totalled 1 . 78 billion marks , up 5 . 6 percent . The group balance sheet total rose 19 . 9 percent to 337 . 5 billion marks . " The profit fall did not surprise me , Bankgesellschaft is a typical turnaround candidate , " said Dieter Hein , banking analyst at BHF - Bank , who said he was maintaining his " speculative buy " recommendation for the stock . Hein predicted earnings per share would show a loss of two marks for 1996 but a profit of 3 . 20 marks for 1997 and 3 . 40 marks for 1998 . Bankgesellschaft , 56 . 8 percent owned by the state of Berlin , had given itself a clean slate with last year ' s allocation to loan loss reserves and provisions were set to fall sharply this year and next , Hein said . But he added he may revise his projections after next Monday ' s news conference at which Bankgesellschaft will unveil detailed results for 1996 . Hein also criticised the bank for declining to hold an analysts ' meeting on its 1996 results and refusing to conduct bilateral interviews with analysts until August . " A bank in such a situation should not refuse to give information to analysts , " Hein said . The bank ' s investor relations department could not immediately be reached for comment . In a move which fuelled speculation about mergers in Germany ' s overcrowded banking sector , Bankgesellschaft and Norddeutsche Landesbank , a regional bank , got the go - ahead from their state owners last year to intensify talks about increasing cooperation . But analysts say the banks are less enthusiastic about a tie - up than their owners , who are expected to profit from any merger by placing a portion of their stake with private investors afterwards .

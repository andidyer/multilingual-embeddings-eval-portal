OLYMPICS - SEVILLE HOPES EXPO LEGACY OVERCOMES BARCELONA MEMORY . Nobody seriously doubts Seville ' s credentials to stage the 2004 Olympic Games . But even the bid ' s most optimistic supporters would be surprised to see the southern city chosen so soon after the highly successful 1992 Barcelona Games . The Expo 92 world fair left the area an enviable infrastructure and organisers say that there is no rule against presenting another candidature . They also point to the example of Los Angeles and Atlanta , the U . S cities which held Summer Games within 16 years of one another . Within Spain , Seville ' s Expo had an even greater impact than the country ' s first Olympics . The six - month event attracted over 42 million visits and saw the city completely transformed by over $ 7 billion in infrastructure spending . The Expo legacy forms the principal argument for the Seville bid . " What distinguishes ours from other candidatures is that the project is real , nearly everything is already in place , " said Sevilla 2004 chief executive Enrique Moreno de la Cova . As a result most of the money needed to create an Olympic city has already been spent . Whereas running costs presented by the 11 candidate cities tend to average $ 1 . 6 billion , Moreno de la Cova points out that the $ 680 million allocated for infrastructure investment in his project is a tenth of what some other cities anticipate . Expo also left Seville , a city of around 700 , 000 people , another distinct advantage over some of its larger rivals . The fair brought the reconditioning of a currently unused island site within walking distance of the historic city centre . The area is large enough to host most of the events , and already has an international rowing and canoeing centre . Other events would be held in existing buildings throughout the city , among them the two 45 , 000 - plus capacity soccer grounds owned by local clubs Sevilla and Betis . The athletics stadium projected as the centrepiece of the games could be reused for soccer , and may become the home of one or more of the teams as well as the Spanish national side . For many years Spain played their home matches in Seville , a city famous for the infectious exuberance of its fans . Locals support the Olympic project with similar enthusiasm . A survey said more than 90 percent of the population backed the bid , and even grafitti in the city park supports the idea of the Games . . The Madrid government , which would finance around a third of the infrastructure spending , has also put itself firmly behind the project . The remaining funds would come from local authorities , with some private enterprise involvement in the Olympic village , while running costs would be financed from television rights , ticket sales , sponsorship , merchandising and related activities . All the figures will remain hypothetical unless IOC voters can be convinced that Spain deserves another Olympic Games . However Moreno de la Cova , who ran the International Olympic Commitee Pavilion during the Expo , may have a trick up his sleeve . In the days after the Barcelona Games the IOC members came down to Seville as his guests , and - - he claims - - succumbed to the charms of a city that has been delighting visitors for centuries . " They know that the Games would work here , " he says " And Seville is the ideal size and location for what the movement says the games should be - - the fiesta of world youth . "

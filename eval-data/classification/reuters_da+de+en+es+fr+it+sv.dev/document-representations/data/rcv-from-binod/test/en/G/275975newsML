Japan media speculate Cuba deal for Lima crisis . Japanese media covering the siege at the residence of their ambassador to Peru hinted on Wednesday a deal might be near to free the captives by allowing the hostage takers to go to Cuba . But Tokyo was quick to deny it was the source of any such speculation , which has been swirling among diplomats here as the siege entered its second week on Christmas Day . " The Japanese task force in Lima has not confirmed any such information as reported by Kyodo News Agency , " Japan ' s official task force in Lima said in a statement . Kyodo news agency had earlier reported that the task force had established " through its own analysis " that a guarantor committee would be set up between the Peruvian government and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) who have been holding over 100 hostages in the residence . The Marxist rebels are demanding the release of over 400 of their jailed comrades . That committee would guarantee the guerrillas ' safety and the rebels would hand over their weapons and the hostages to the committee , Kyodo said . The rebels could then go into exile in Cuba , a country which would be sympathetic to the Havana - inspired MRTA , with a third country , possibly Canada , acting as a mediator , it said . The task force statement was sent to Japanese journalists here almost immediately after the Kyodo report was published . Japan ' s daily Mainichi shimbun , quoting informed sources close to Cuba , said on Wednesday the Cuban government has decided to grant asylum to the MRTA , adding that Cuban president Fidel Castro ' s government has unofficially made the offer to the Japanese ambassador to Cuba . The Castro administration deemed official requests from Tokyo and Lima were a prerequisite to avoid being criticised as a country which supports terrorism , the Mainichi said . A diplomat at the Cuban Embassy in Lima told Reuters that Havana ' s ambassador here , Pedro Diaz , had conferred with Foreign Minister Roberto Kobaina on Monday but declined to give details of the discussions . Diaz , who spent five days as a captive in the residence before being released with 225 hostages on Sunday night , spent Tuesday in meetings , the diplomat added . Other embassies were awash with speculation . " I think this could be the best option now , but I don ' t have any evidence that it ' s even yet become a serious option , " said one U . S . official in Lima , who asked not to be named . Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and MRTA spokesmen inside the residence have both expressed hopes for a negotiated solution but shown no signs of being close to one . Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has predicted the crisis will drag on . " We ' re in for a long haul , " he said .

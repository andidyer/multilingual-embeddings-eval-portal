Belgium says some former Zaire officials can visit . Belgium says it will give visitor visas to officials of ousted Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko ' s regime , but only if in the past they voiced support for democratic change in the country . " Our policy towards officials from Zaire ( renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo ) remains the same , " said Andre Querton , spokesman for Belgium ' s foreign ministry . " Those who in the past have publicly supported democratic transition in the country can apply for and are usually granted visas to visit Belgium . Those who have voiced against democratic transition are not welcome . " Belgium severed " non - essential " links with Kinshasha in 1994 in protest at the pace of democratic transition and vowed to deal only with politicians and officials who openly backed reform . As the former Zaire ' s colonial ruler , Belgium has long been a haven for opponents of Mobutu but has also been popular with his supporters , many of whom were educated at its universities . Its capital boasts a vibrant black quarter popularly known as Matonge after a working - class Kinshasha suburb , and scores of Zaireans have settled and run small businesses there . " We have no figures or records of former Mobutu officials who may be in Belgium , " Querton said . " Of course the situation is complicated by the fact that in Europe we have a treaty . . . which means we may not in fact be aware if a certain person entered Europe in one country and then arrived in Belgium from there without us knowing . " Hundreds of senior Mobutu officials fled Zaire before and after Kinshasha fell to rebel forces of Laurent Kabila ' s Alliance on May 17 . They include dozens who enriched themselves in the 32 years of Mobutu ' s rule , buying expensive property and businesses in Belgium , France and elsewhere abroad . Kabila has since declared himself president and renamed the country , while Mobutu and his entourage are in temporary exile in Morocco . Querton warned Belgium would not allow itself to be used as a staging post for inciting further turmoil in Kinshasha . " Obviously we would not like it for officials to come to Belgium and stir up any resentment or such a thing , " he said . " If someone who was allowed to visit Belgium engaged in such activities , we would of course review the situation . " He said the government was not expecting any request from Mobutu for a visa . " I think it is highly unlikely he would want to come to Belgium . He has not been here for many years . . . he has very few friends here and in fact has no reason to be here . " Mobutu has spent lengthy periods recuperating from prostate cancer in France and Switzerland in the past year and Paris has said it would grant him a visa to seek further medical treatment .

The following are economists ' reactions to preliminary consumer prices data from 11 sample Italian cities which indicate May CPI growing at 1 . 5 - 1 . 6 percent year on year and 0 . 2 / 0 . 3 percent month on month . Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast on average a year on year rate of 1 . 5 percent and a month on month rate of 0 . 2 percent , compared with 1 . 7 percent and 0 . 1 percent respectively in April . Lorenzo Codogno economist at Bank of America said : " Today ' s data are slightly less positive than yesterday ' s but overall it confirms the forecasts already made on the first four cities ( of 1 . 5 percent ) . " Four of the 11 sample cities released their data on Tuesday , and analysts said they indicated a year on year rate of 1 . 5 percent . Paolo Casadio at Credito Italiano said : " He ( Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio ) will not cut straight away but more probably the Friday before the ( central bank ' s ) annual assembly . He will wait to find out more about the Dpef . " The Bank holds its annual assembly on Saturday May 31 . The Dpef is the government ' s three - year economic plan which is expected to be examined by the cabinet early next week . Martino Dolfini at Chase said the cities where inflation was higher seemed to be those with a bigger influx of tourists " so we think that ' s a factor linked to the start of the tourist season .

At Banca Commerciale Italiana Rodolfo Dozio said while the data were not quite as good as Tuesday ' s they still estimated the rate at 1 . 5 percent year on year for May . He noted a rise in postal charges in some cities but said " If you take out this one - off effect then overall the data remains positive . " He expected a rate cut of 75 basis points definitely by the end of the month and said while an easing was more likely next week , there was a chance it could come in the next few days . - - Milan bureau + 39 2 66129507

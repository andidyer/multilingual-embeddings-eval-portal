Israel , PLO gird for fight over homes for Jews . Israelis and Palestinians girded for battle on Monday over a Jewish settlement planned for Arab East Jerusalem , pressuring officials to try to arrange a summit to defuse tensions . Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he had sent more troops into the West Bank and Gaza Strip to pre - empt Palestinian violence when ground is broken this week on the project to build 6 , 500 houses for Jews . " Our working assumption is that incidents are likely to occur , even severe incidents , " he told reporters . Officials said they were trying to arrange a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Yasser Arafat that could even take place on Monday night . Palestinian Authority member Faisal al - Husseini and about 15 other Palestinians launched a sit - in meanwhile near the planned settlement site on a hilltop known as Har Homa in Hebrew , Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic . They pitched two tents and lit a campfire . Bulldozers languished some two kilometres ( about a mile ) away . Drivers said they were waiting for orders to start work . " If they enter with their bulldozers , we will enter , " said Husseini , the PLO ' s official in charge of Jerusalem affairs . Some 100 Israeli troops in battle gear were perched on a hill opposite the tents , armed with automatic rifles and teargas . " I said and I say again that we will begin laying the groundwork needed for construction this week . What we said we will do , " Netanyahu told supporters in parliament . " Work will begin within the next two days , " Netanyahu ' s communications director David Bar - Illan told Reuters . He said it would involve both surveying work and clearing land . Israel ' s decision to build plunged peace moves into a slump , angering Palestinians who want East Jerusalem as a future capital . Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and insists that peace deals with the PLO do not bar building settlements . " No doubt that the Israeli insistence contradicts partly and totally the peace process and the signed agreements and it ' s a flagrant violation to what has been agreed upon , " Arafat told reporters in the Palestinian - ruled Gaza Strip . Jordan ' s Crown Prince Hassan , who met Arafat , agreed the world opposed such unilateral actions . But he added : " The hope is there that the coming days and weeks will be better than the days we lived through in the current crisis . " Jerusalem ' s future was supposed to be negotiated in tough " final - status " talks that were supposed to start on Monday . Israel agreed on Monday to let Arafat use an airport in Gaza for personal flights in a move Israel billed as a gesture to help ease the tension but Palestinians said the crisis would be defused only if Israel cancelled its settlement plans . Israel handed over most of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian self - rule under peace deals since 1993 but retains overall control of security and border crossings . Sixty - one Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers died in clashes last September that erupted after Israel punched an opening in a tunnel in East Jerusalem near key Islamic sites .

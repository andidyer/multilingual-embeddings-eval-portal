NAV Canada says C $ 3 bln facility completed . NAV Canada said on Friday that the underwriting of a C $ 3 billion facility has been completed and was significantly oversubscribed . The privatized national air traffic control company received an aggregate commitment in excess of C $ 7 billion from the underwriting group of ten banks , led by Royal Bank of Canada . The underwriting group also includes the Bank of Montreal , Bank of Nova Scotia , the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , the Toronto Dominion Bank and Societe General as managing agents . National Bank of Canada , Chase Manhattan Bank , Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd and JP Morgan are co - agents . " We are delighted with the support our syndication has received . This represents a tremendous vote of confidence from the banking community in the company ' s future , " said Ken Copeland , NAV Canada ' s president and chief executive officer . The facility is now in the documentation phase . The company ' s acquisition of the Canadian civil air navigation system is expected to close by the end of the month . The general syndication of the facility will follow shortly . Due to the strong support of the market at the underwriting stage , NAV Canada has exercised its right under the C $ 3 billion facility to adjust the amounts of the three tranches so that each is C $ 1 billion . The facility is divided into two Canadian domestic tranches of C $ 1 billion each , with maturities of 30 months and five years respectively . A C $ 1 billion international tranche has an initial availability of 364 days with a five - year term out . - - Reuters Toronto Bureau ( 416 ) 941 - 8100

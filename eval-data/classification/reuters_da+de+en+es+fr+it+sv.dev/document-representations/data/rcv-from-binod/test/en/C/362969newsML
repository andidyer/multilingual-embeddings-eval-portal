CEZ shares surge despite doubtful outlook . Shares of the main Czech power utility CEZ a . s . have surged on a wave of foreign interest in one of the few liquid Prague issues , but the rise has little fundamental basis , analysts said on Friday . The shares of the second most highly capitalised issue on the Prague Stock Exchange ( PSE ) have jumped 15 percent in the last two weeks , and closed trading on Friday at 1 , 230 crowns ( $ 44 . 1 ) , up 20 crowns from Thursday ' s close . " On a purely speculative basis , our traders would buy ( at up to ) 1 , 200 crowns , " said Bram Buring of the Brno Broker Group . " We ( analysts ) however are more pessimistic about a company with declining earnings and no dividends , and above 1 , 100 our recommendation is to hold . " Nonetheless , the CEZ bull run has led the PSE to a 10 . 7 percent rise in its official PX50 index , as the stock carries a 14 percent weighting . CEZ has a dominant position in the supply of power throughout the country , but many analysts are warning about earnings which are under pressure from a price settlement arrangement with regional distributors . " The financial situation of CEZ does not prosper from long - term price bidding with distribution companies , " said Zdenka Sauerova of Expandia Finance . Analysts expect power prices for distributors will still be mediated by the Industry and Trade Ministry each year , despite an agreement on a pricing formula earlier this year . CEZ , meanwhile , has to continue financing the modernisation of its generating capacity and distribution network , and analysts said the price development did not appear to support both investment and significant earnings growth . " The attractiveness of the company is negatively influenced by the price directives which over time will be actually decreases in real - terms , " said Michal Kusak of Akro Capital . Management has forecast net profit will dip to eight billion Czech crowns from 8 . 9 million in 1995 , a forecast with which most analysts agree . But they question whether CEZ will be able to stick to its goal of paying a first ever dividend on 1996 profits with such questions on longer - term earnings prospects and huge investment demands . Outstanding costs of the completion of the Temelin nuclear station alone are forecast at at least 76 billion crowns , and there are still huge costs for modernising coal - burning plants and the national power grid . The Temelin project has been delayed several times already , raising the costs of an already pricey project . " The consideration of dividends will be influenced by the delays in construction of Temelin which I see as the biggest danger for the company , " said Akro ' s Kusak . - - Prague Newsroom , 42 - 2 - 2423 - 0003 ( $ = 27 . 89 Czech Crowns )

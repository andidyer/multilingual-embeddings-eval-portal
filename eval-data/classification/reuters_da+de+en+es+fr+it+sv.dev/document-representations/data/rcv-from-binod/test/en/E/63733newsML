S . Africa ' s Erwin confident in Africa - link future . South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said on Thursday that he was confident in the country ' s future , but it could not be separated from that of its African neighbours . " We are truly in the period of an African renaissance . It ' s not going to be easy , but we ' re going to make it , " he told delegates from oil - producing countries and companies attending the three - day Africa Upstream 1996 conference in Cape Town . " We don ' t have the luxury of thinking we as an economy can grow if our neighbours don ' t grow . " He was confident the South African economy could achieve a growth rate of six percent by 1999 . The minister denied misconceptions surfacing outside the country that South Africa was determined to maintain a protectionist stronghold in the industrial sector . " We are prepared to make changes more rapidly than our neighbours and recently we ' ve had successful negotiations , " he said . Erwin pointed out as examples the planned US $ 4 billion Maputo Development Corridor project , as well as successful negotiations with Zimbabwe on a clothing and textile agreement and a cooperation on investment agreement . In this light he said , mutual investments and economic cooperation between South Africa and its neighbours was critical . Erwin said conferences like Africa Upstream were significant because they provided a forum for creating economic cooperation on investment and trade . - - Melanie Cheary , Cape Town Newsroom + 27 21 252238 .

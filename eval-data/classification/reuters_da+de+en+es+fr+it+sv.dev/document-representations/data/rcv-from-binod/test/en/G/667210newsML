U . S . court orders White House - Espy papers review . A U . S . appeals court ruled Tuesday that a federal judge wrongly allowed the Clinton White House to withhold 84 documents subpoenaed by a grand jury investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy . The appeals court ordered the U . S . District Court judge to conduct a more detailed review of the documents , which have been at the centre of a long legal battle between the White House and independent counsel Donald Smaltz . The appeals court said the judge made a mistake by failing to provide any explanation or legal reasoning in rejecting a request from the prosecutors to force the White House to comply with the subpoena . Smaltz is investigating allegations that Espy , who was appointed by President Clinton in 1993 , accepted illegal gifts from companies the Agriculture Department regulated . Espy , who resigned in 1994 , has denied any wrongdoing . The grand jury , acting at Smaltz ' s direction , issued the subpoena in October 1994 for documents gathered in connection with a report by the White House counsel , made at Clinton ' s request , concerning the allegations . The report was made public , but the White House sought to keep the 84 supporting documents secret on the grounds of executive privilege and that such presidential communications and deliberations were covered . In a similar case , the White House has pending a Supreme Court appeal arguing that attorney - client privilege allows it to withhold from Whitewater prosecutors notes of talks by government lawyers with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . In the Espy case , the appeals court cited the Supreme Court ' s historic 1974 ruling in the Watergate tapes case involving President Nixon in laying out the principles the judge must balance in making a decision . Smaltz " has demonstrated that it is likely the subpoenaed documents contain important evidence that is not available elsewhere , " the appeals court said in the 55 - page ruling . He " has demonstrated a sufficient showing of need to obtain certain information in some of the documents . " The decision was written by Judge Patricia Wald , who was named to the bench by President Carter . She was considered , but not selected , by Clinton as a possible candidate for attorney general in 1993 . She was joined in the decision by Judges Douglas Ginsburg , who was appointed in the mid - 1980s by President Reagan , and Judith Rogers , a Clinton appointee . The legal battle previously had been conducted in secret , and the ruling marked the first public disclosure involving the details . Small parts of the ruling still were kept secret on specific potential criminal charges . Wald said the test for the prosecutors to overcome a claim of presidential privilege involved showing why the evidence was important to the investigation and why it was unavailable from another source . " We are ever mindful of the dangers involved in cloaking government operations in secrecy and in placing obstacles in the path of the grand jury in its investigatory mission , " she said . But Wald also acknowledged that a " powerful counterweight " existed in preserving informed presidential deliberations . She said virtually all of the documents had been written by White House lawyers and that presidential privilege did apply .

RBNZ projects lower govt fiscal surpluses . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand in its six monthly Monetary Policy Statement on Friday projected lower fiscal surpluses than the government forecast in its Thursday budget . The bank projected a budget surplus of 0 . 9 percent of GDP in 1997 / 98 compared with the budget forecast of 1 . 5 percent . The gap between the two forecasts , which are done on the same methodology , widens . The bank projects the ratio at 0 . 8 percent in the March 1999 year and 0 . 7 percent in 2000 against Treasury ' s forecast of 1 . 9 percent and 2 . 6 percent . Explanation for the bank ' s lower forecast lies largely in lower growth forecasts than Treasury ' s . The RBNZ forecasts real annual average growth at 2 . 0 in the March 1998 year , rising to 3 . 6 percent and 3 . 8 percent in succeeding years . Treasury forecasts growth at 2 . 4 percent in 1998 and then 4 . 2 percent and 3 . 5 percent in the following years . - - Wellington newsroom ( 64 4 ) 473 4746

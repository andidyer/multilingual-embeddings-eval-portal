An International Monetary Fund mission is due to return to Moscow anytime between now and mid - November and investors are hoping the Fund will release the October tranche of a 10 . 2 billion loan , delayed amid disagreements over tax collection .

But Foreign & Colonial saw investors remaining on the sidelines , waiting to see how far interest rates will climb . Disappointment over delays to the start - up of Mexico ' s pension plans , and backtracking on its petrochemical privatisation programme , have been weighing on the market tone . Meanwhile a 100 - strong delegation of ARGENTINE business leaders , headed by Economy Minister Rocque Fernandez , arrives in London this week for meetings with foreign investors . Their arrival comes against a backdrop of government criticism by former economy minister Domingo Cavallo .

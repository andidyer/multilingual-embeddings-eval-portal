BULGARIAN PRESIDENT WOULD BACK MONARCHY REFERENDUM . Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov met exiled King Simeon on Wednesday and said he would be willing to hold a referendum on restoring the monarchy if parliament voted for it . Bulgaria ' s monarch and republican president , who had lunch together in the communist - era presidency building , said they had found much common ground , particularly on the need for Bulgaria ' s reform programme to have broad political support . The king arrived in Bulgaria on Tuesday for a ceremony in the northern town of Veliko Tarnovo marking the 118th anniversary of Bulgaria ' s first constitution , which provided for a monarchy and was suspended in 1946 after the Soviet army installed a communist regime . " It should be noted that the Tarnovo constitution was cancelled under the pressure of a foreign military power , " Stoyanov said . " So if the Bulgarian parliament decides to conduct a referendum on whether to have a republic or a monarchy , I will accept and support the decision . " In a speech in Veliko Tarnovo , Simeon , 59 , called on the political forces contesting Saturday ' s elections to unite in a broad coalition to bring Bulgaria out of economic crisis . " I share his majesty ' s view on a reformist majority in the new parliament as I think that any single - party majority will have only limited success in implementing the reforms , " Stoyanov said . " The idea of a reformist majority means broad parliamentary support and cooperation between all parties represented in parliament . " The lunch , without meat in the Lenten tradition as Bulgarians celebrate Orthodox Easter on April 27 , included a bean dish that the presidency said was had been a favourite of Simeon ' s grandfather Ferdinand . " We hope that serious reforms will take place after the elections and that should have a positive effect on the attitude of the West to our country , " said Simeon , a Madrid - based business consultant who returned to Bulgaria last May for the first time in 50 years . " I believe in Bulgaria ' s future and I think that in the near future the country will be integrated in Europe . " After meeting Stoyanov , Simeon walked to the cabinet building to meet interim Prime Minister Stefan Sofianski . He left for Madrid on Wednesday afternoon . Simeon , exiled as a child in 1946 , was greeted by thousands of well - wishers in Veliko Tarnovo on Tuesday but heavy snow in Sofia deterred all but the most enthusiastic monarchists . A crowd of about 200 people waving national flags gathered outside the presidency , far fewer than those who turned out last year for his first visit . The King spent the night in the mountain village of Arbanassy at a residence built by former communist leader Todor Zhivkov . The main monarchist parties contested the last elections in coalition with the centre - right Union of Democratic Forces , which is expected to win a majority on Saturday , but this time several have formed an alliance with the ethnic Turks ' Movement for Rights and Freedoms . The King said he was not supporting one political force over another and criticised politicians and journalists who he said had misrepresented his position . He urged Bulgarians to turn out to vote on Saturday to show support for the reforms agreed between the interim cabinet and international financial institutions .

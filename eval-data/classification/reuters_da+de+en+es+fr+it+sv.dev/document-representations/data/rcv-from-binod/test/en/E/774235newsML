UK PMI index 53 . 4 , 14th consecutive expansion . Britain ' s manufacturing sector grew for the fourteenth month in succession in July despite a sharp fall in export demand , the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ( CIPS ) said . Its purchasing managers report , sponsored by Reuters , showed the seasonally - adjusted purchasing managers ' index ( PMI ) slipped slightly to 53 . 4 from 53 . 5 in June , but any reading over 50 represents expansion in manufacturing . " The continued expansion of the manufacturing economy largely reflected a strong rise in output during the month , " CIPS said . " The rate of growth of output accelerated in July as companies reported rising backlogs of orders and further growth in new orders . " Order books strengthened for the 14th consecutive month with consumer - driven domestic demand once more the principal source of new business . " The pace of growth slowed slightly , however , as export orders fell for the first time since this survey began monitoring exports in January 1996 . " It said the decline was almost entirely attributed to the rise in the value of the pound reducing the competitiveness of UK goods overseas . But the strong pound continued to reduce the cost of imported goods for manufacturers . Average input prices recorded the sharpest monthly fall since the survey began in July 1991 with almost one in three firms reporting a reduction in average prices compared to the previous month . Employment rose for the 13th month in a row , but growth was more muted than in previous months as an increasing number of firms were found to have laid off employees as a result of weakened export order books . And , despite eagerness among purchasing managers to buy as few goods as necessary in order to reduce costs , the July survey found a further deterioration in suppliers ' delivery times , reflecting growing capacity constraints and supply bottlenecks . Following are the seasonally adjusted PMI indices , with originally reported June figures in brackets : July June Purchasing managers ' index 53 . 4 53 . 5 ( 53 . 4 ) Output 56 . 8 55 . 2 ( 55 . 0 ) New orders 54 . 7 56 . 0 ( 56 . 3 ) Quantity of purchases 52 . 4 51 . 2 ( 51 . 3 ) Prices 38 . 8 43 . 6 ( 43 . 5 ) Suppliers ' delivery times 46 . 3 48 . 4 ( 49 . 2 ) Stocks of purchases 45 . 8 46 . 7 ( 46 . 8 ) Stocks of finished goods 46 . 5 46 . 5 ( 46 . 6 ) Employment 51 . 0 52 . 3 ( 52 . 5 ) Exports 47 . 1 51 . 7 ( n / a ) NOTE : The PMI is based on a weighted average of seasonally adjusted measures of output , new orders , suppliers ' delivery times , stocks of items purchased and employment . A reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is generally expanding , below 50 that it is generally contracting . - - Rosemary Bennett , London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774

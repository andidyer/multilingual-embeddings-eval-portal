US sailor jailed 3 years in Japan for rape attempt . A Japanese court on Thursday sentenced a U . S . Navy serviceman to three years in prison for the assault and attempted rape of a woman near a base in northern Japan , court officials said . Chief Petty Officer Raymond Cunningham , 39 , was jailed for a March 20 attack on a 31 - year - old Japanese woman in Hachinohe , a city near Misawa air base 560 km ( 350 miles ) north of Tokyo . Presiding Judge Kazuhiko Kinugasa described the attack as a " malicious and vicious " act which had a serious social impact in a country sensitive to crimes by U . S . military personnel . Prosecutors said during the trial that the sailor struck the woman in the face and knocked her down during a late night assault , causing injuries which required two weeks treatment in hospital . Cunningham had confessed to an earlier rape attempt on another woman in January , the prosecution said . Crimes committed by U . S . military personnel stationed in Japan under a bilateral security treaty have come under intense scrutiny since three U . S . servicemen raped a 12 - year - old schoolgirl on the southern island of Okinawa in September 1995 . The rape , for which the men are serving terms of up to seven years in a Japanese prison , sparked a campaign for the reduction of the U . S . military presence on Okinawa , home to about half of the 47 , 000 U . S . forces based in Japan . Tokyo and Washington have responded to the calls with a plan to gradually scale down bases and shift some operations away from Okinawa to other bases on Japan ' s main islands .

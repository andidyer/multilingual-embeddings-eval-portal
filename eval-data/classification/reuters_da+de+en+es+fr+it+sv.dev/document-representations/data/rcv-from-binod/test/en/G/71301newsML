Austria traces most Cold War U . S . arsenals . Austria has wound up a search for 79 underground arms depots dug around the countryside by the United States during the Cold War to help fend off a Soviet invasion , Interior Minister Caspar Einem said on Monday . Einem told a news conference the authorities had uncovered 65 depots , containing thousands of tonnes of explosives and hundreds of pieces of artillery . Six remained untraced . The other eight came to light by chance soon after they were created in the early 1950s . The United States only informed Vienna of the existence of the depots in January . World War Two victors the United States , the Soviet Union , Britain and France occupied defeated Austria from 1945 to 1955 . Washington and Britain feared Moscow might launch an invasion from the eastern sector of Austria under its control to seize the whole of the country as a satellite . Soldiers from both countries hid scores of weapons depots in western and southern Austria to provide partisans with arms . Rumours abounded that gold was also stored with the arms caches but none was found . Einem said the U . S . weapons were buried so deep that partisan fighters would have had little chance of recovering them before they were overrun by invading troops . " It would have been almost impossible to get at ( the weapons ) quickly , " he said . He noted occupying British forces had stashed their weapons caches in the top soil . " But they had the disadvantage that they were often looted , " Einem said . Austria made safe the British arms depots in the 1960s .

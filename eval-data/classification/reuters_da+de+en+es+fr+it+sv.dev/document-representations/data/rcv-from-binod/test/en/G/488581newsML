Suspected IRA motorway bomb hits British industry . Sections of key British motorways remained closed on Friday , costing industry millions of pounds ( dollars ) , as police continued searches after finding a suspected IRA bomb . Prime Minister John Major blamed the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) for the disruption , which began at the height of Thursday morning ' s rush hour when police received coded telephone calls warning of bombs on various motorways in central England . The Financial Times said Thursday ' s gridlock at the centre of the country ' s motorway network halted exports from northern Britain via the Channel ports and cost industry millions of pounds . The Freight Transport Association estimated the cost of the delays to industry at about 2 . 3 million pounds ( $ 3 . 77 million ) an hour , the newspaper said . It quoted the association as saying about 77 , 000 trucks would normally have used the motorways that were closed . A Defence Ministry bomb squad , sent to a motorway bridge where a suspect package was found , said the bomb could have caused considerable damage . Earlier reports had said the device was harmless . " The advice we have from bomb disposal experts is that the device was a viable bomb which , if it had gone off , could have caused considerable damage and possible loss of life as well , " a police spokesman said by telephone . Police closed off sections of the motorways as they carried out an extensive search of the area . Thousands of motorists were caught as traffic came to a virtual standstill . " It was intended deliberately to cause trouble , " Major told reporters while campaigning for Britain ' s May 1 general election . " It looks as though it was the IRA playing silly games . " Coded telephone calls are the standard warning given by the IRA , which is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland . The movement ended a 17 - month ceasefire in February 1996 and has since detonated several bombs on the mainland . No group claimed responsibility for the warnings . " There was a proper code word used , " Major said . The use of a code agreed between guerrilla groups and the security forces would seem to rule out a hoax by a member of the public , he said . " I think most people know what the IRA are and see them for what they are , " he said . Mo Mowlam , the Northern Ireland spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party , also blamed the IRA . " Labour deplores this action by the IRA . The IRA . . . must understand a new Labour government would oppose tooth and nail the use of violent and terrorist methods for political ends , " she said . Last week the IRA caused major disruption to rail services after they detonated two bombs at an important rail junction in the northwestern town of Wilmslow . The major rail station of Doncaster was closed for eight hours on the same day after an anonymous caller said explosive devices had been hidden in the station . A spokesman for Sinn Fein , the political wing of the IRA , said it was unlikely the guerrilla group would renew its ceasefire before the British election on May 1 . Sinn Fein has been barred from Northern Ireland peace talks until the IRA agrees definitively to lay down its arms . ( $ 1 = . 6094 Pound )

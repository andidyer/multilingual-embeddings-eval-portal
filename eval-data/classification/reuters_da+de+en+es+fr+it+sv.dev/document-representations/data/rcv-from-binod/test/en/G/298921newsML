Three ex - Soviet states declare eternal friendship . Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan on Friday signed a treaty on " eternal friendship " boosting cooperation , including military ties , between the three Central Asian states . The presidents of the former Soviet republics told a news conference after the signing in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek that the treaty was " objectively prompted by history itself " . " Our becoming closer is objective . . . Some 400 years ago there were no Kazakhs , Uzbeks or Kyrgyz . We are one nation and are branches of the same root , " said Uzbek President Islam Karimov . The Kazakhs , Uzbeks and Kyrgyz all have roots in old Turkic tribes who used to populate vast territories in Central Asia . The three states , whose present borders were drawn up under the Soviet Union and which have a total population of more than 40 million , won independence when it collapsed in 1991 . The treaty is intended to boost economic cooperation and the three leaders also agreed on military support for each other if any of them came under threat . " If the territorial integrity and independence of one of our states is threatened by another force . . . the leaders of the three states may themselves take measures , including military ones , to defend our states , " said Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev . The presidents have expressed concern that stability in their states could eventually be shattered by militant Islamic fundamentalism which has prevailed in nearby Afghanistan and is getting stronger in the Central Asian state of Tajikistan . The three states , along with Russia , have sent peacekeeping troops to safeguard a fragile peace in Tajikistan , devastated by four years of civil war . An official who participated in the summit told reporters the three presidents had decided to prolong their Tajik mission for at least another six months . The treaty also boosted cooperation within the Central Asian Economic Union set up in 1993 . " Our common economic space is already of primary importance for us , " said Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev . The three leaders said the economic union had already spurred trade among their countries and Nazarbayev , who chaired the summit , said Russia and Tajikistan had asked to attend the next meeting of the economic union as observers . But reforms have been slower in Uzbekistan , whose controversial multiple exchange rate mechanism prevents mutual convertibility of the three states ' currencies . The Central Asian Bank for Cooperation and Development , set up by the three countries in 1994 , failed to adopt an active role as it lacked the capital to launch big investment projects . Karimov said he hoped all three members of the union would benefit from a South Korean joint venture in Uzbekistan which assembles Daewoo cars .

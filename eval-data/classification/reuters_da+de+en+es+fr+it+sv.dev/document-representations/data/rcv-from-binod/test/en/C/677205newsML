ADM ' s Man buy creates new global cocoa force . The restructuring of the world ' s cocoa processing industry looks complete after ADM ' s takeover of ED & F Man ' s processing activities , analysts said on Friday . The takeover , with a $ 108 million cash price tag plus the assumption of debt , propels ADM to the top of the world cocoa processing league , leapfrogging Swiss - French giant Barry - Callebaut , which is part of Klaus J Jacobs Holding . ADM ( Archer Daniels Midland ) of the United States is already one of the world largest producers of agricultural crops and the deal is further proof of its ambitions . " It ' s a very aggressive move , and takes them in six months to number one in the cocoa world , " one trade analyst said . Traders estimate ADM ' s global bean - grinding capacity to have lept to 450 , 000 tonnes , against Callebaut - Barry ' s 350 , 000 tonnes and privately - owned U . S . trade house Cargill ' s 260 , 000 . Cocoa is the raw material from which chocolate is made , though it is also used in other products including some cosmetics . Traders said the purchase was the latest step in the global consolidation of the cocoa trade and had implications for the commodity , traded on exchanges in London and New York . The moves have been prompted by tight margins . In February , ADM bought Grace Cocoa from W . R . Grace & Co for more than $ 470 million , a buy that included Grace Cocoa ' s major Dutch processor Cacao de Zaan , since re - named as ADM Zaan and now the centre for ADM ' s global cocoa operations . The latest deal involves ADM buying five ED & F Man cocoa processing units - - two in the United States , one in Britain , one in Poland and , most crucially , one in Brazil . " It ' s the foothold in Brazil that ' s the key , " another trade source said , adding that this could put pressure on the world ' s number three processor , Cargill , to boost its origin activities . ADM , until now without a link to Brazil , was rumoured to be bidding against Cargill for control of the Man units . Although Cargill already has a presence in Brazil , it does not in the Ivory Coast , where ADM has a stake in the country ' s second largest processor UNICAO . Callebaut - Barry , formed by the 1996 merger of Swiss Callebaut AG and France ' s Cacao Barry , already has three Ivorian cocoa factories . The Ivory Coast , the world largest cocoa grower , has said it wants to process 50 percent of its annual production domestically by 2000 . " It will force Cargill to look at Abidjan again , " one source commented . " But margins are already tight . " The top three processors now control around 50 percent of total world grindings , estimated by ED & F Man at 2 . 69 million tonnes in the 1995 / 96 season . " This is the completion of the restructuring process and if you look at the three giants in the industry , they buy and sell roughly at the same margins . Cocoa is dead as a tradable commodity , " one continental trader said . But Amsterdam believes it can profit from the ADM / Man deal , which it sees as reinforcing the port city ' s role as an international hub for the commodity , which is widely grown in Africa , Latin - America and Asia . " It can only enhance Amsterdam ' s role as the prime player in world cocoa . Both ADM and Cargill are likely to continue running their world cocoa operations from Amsterdam , " said Louis Bensdorp , managing director of the Dutch Cocoa Association .

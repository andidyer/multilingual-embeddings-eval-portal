BOXING - MENDY MAKES FIRST DEFENCE AGAINST JOHNSTON . Holder Jean - Baptiste Mendy will be looking to profit from a marked height and reach advantage when defends his World Boxing Council ( WBC ) lightweight title against unbeaten American Steve Johnston on Saturday . Johnston , unbeaten in 20 professional bouts since 1993 , is at 1 . 65 metres a head shorter than his French rival who won the vacant title 10 months ago against another American , Lamar Murphy . " Mendy is big , he ' s got long arms , he boxes well and it ' s difficult to foresee what tactics he ' s going to use but I ' m confident , " Johnston said at the weigh - in . Dakar - born Mendy , 10 years older than Johnston at 34 , said : " Johnston seems very intelligent and he has the same style as me , he ' s simply smaller , that ' s our main difference . So I think we ' re going to have a great fight . " Mendy , the first Frenchman to win the world lightweight title , won the WBC crown at the second attempt in his 57th professional fight at Levallois outside Paris on April 20 last year . He had lost inside five rounds against former holder Miguel Angel Gonzalez of Mexico in March 1994 . The Mexican later left the title vacant when he went up to the super lightweights . Mendy said , despite his age , that he had no retirement plans and wanted to defend his world title as many times as he did the European crown - - nine . The delay of nearly a year in putting his title on the line has been due to a promoter ' s failed attempt to stage the fight with Johnston in Mendy ' s native Dakar . Johnston ' s promoter Bob Arum said in Senegal : " There ' s no money , only alligators . " Mendy ' s trainer Houari Amri replied : " Pity the fight couldn ' t take place in Senegal . Johnston wouldn ' t have been eaten by crocodiles but he would have been stung by the tse - tse fly . Jean - Ba ' s right . " Frenchman Julien Lorcy and Mexican Arnulfo " Chico " Castillo fight for the vacant World Boxing Organisation super featherweight crown on the same bill .

Belarus - Russia union deal seen as largely symbolic . A new integration deal between Russia and Belarus is a largely symbolic step unlikely to rock the boat in the former Soviet Union , officials and commentators said on Saturday . " It ' s hard to imagine something more amorphous , " the liberal Sevodnya newspaper said in a front page commentary on the deal , signed on Friday by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko . " It does not advance the issue of economic integration of the two states very much , " said Izvestia , another liberal daily . The exact contents of the charter , aimed at appealing to widespread nostalgia for the Soviet Union in both countries , were kept under wraps until the last moment . But in contrast to the orignial draft , their unveiling did not get pulses racing . " There are no surprises , there ' s a compromise between the efforts of various political forces taking part in discussions and the political fight over the union . Like all compromises , it does not fully suit either one or other force , " Izvestia said . Sevodnya said the charter , aimed at filling out a Union Treaty signed last month , ended up making the treaty little different from a deal on a forming a commonwealth between them signed a year ago which had so far had little practical effect . The original Union Treaty , which would have included concrete measures to integrate two neighbours with very different records on reform , was drastically scaled back after a last - minute intervention by liberals in the Russian government . The newly - appointed liberals feared that the original Treaty , drawn up partly in response to NATO ' s plans to expand towards Russia ' s borders , might have dragged Russia backwards and given the hardline Lukashenko too much power . The result was a series of pledges to protect political freedoms and market reforms and foster ties , what Lukashenko called a de jure confirmation of what already existed de facto . " So not much has come of the integration . Has it managed to scare NATO ? Also no . For the union promises nothing deeper than coordination of foreign policy , " said Sevodnya . " In vain they scared the average Russian that he would get a president Lukashenko . He won ' t come , " it said . Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov sounded a note of uncertainty about the practical fate of the deal in dismissing a suggestion that it might alienate the 10 other former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) . " The union of Russia and Belarus . . . if this whole thing is implemented , will on the contrary I think strengthen the centralisation of the Commonwealth of Independent States , " he told a news conference . Several CIS states had expressed fears that a union between Russia and Belarus would threaten the loose political grouping , but in the run - up to Friday ' s signing Kazakhstan was almost alone in voicing its concerns . Afterwards first Kazakh deputy foreign minister Yerlan Idrisov was sceptical that the Union Treaty would amount to much , noting that plans to make the CIS into a kind of post - Soviet European Union were stuck on the drawing board . " The Union between Russia and Belarus should prove its effectiveness in practice . Otherwise it faces the fate of many other integration deals and agreements signed at various times in the framework of the CIS , which remained on paper , " he said . " Kazakhstan will develop its multifaceted ties with Russia and Belarus taking into account changes which have taken place , " Idrisov was quoted as saying by Itar - Tass news agency . Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said the deal did not concern his Baltic state , which like Latvia and Estonia , did not join the CIS and is sensitive to anything which might be perceived as an aggressive move by Moscow . " I think that creating a Union will not influence our good bilateral , goodneighbourly relations with both Russia and Belarus , " he told Itar - Tass news agency .
